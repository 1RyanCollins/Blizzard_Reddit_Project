If you guys could settle on one costume / image / message.

For those of you with Twitter, remember to hit Blizz up there too.
In this house, we stan Mei.
Fuck Blizzard, they're supporting a genocide.
Does anyone think that these Mei memes are too mild?

She should say stuff like...

* "Down with the CCP!!"
* "Hong Kong Independence!!"

if you really want to rile up the Chinese government.
Fuck blizzards dude

Man, Im so torn about this whole thing. I love everything it stands for. But, man oh man, do I fucking hate Mei. Hopefully she gets deleted, and we can make Teemo the next icon for protests.
pretty sure they censored off the top post of the blizzchina flag. my husband posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dfzlm8/this_is_odd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) recently and its not showing up in the new feed.

Too bad that the voice actor supports China apparently
Can someone tell me what blizzard did that was so bad?? I've kind of been out of the loop üò¨ haven't had WiFi and only been watching local news

OK blizz we all want protest MEI to be the next character skin.
Somebody do this to hanzo also I would not complain if he was removed from game
I support this.
No offense but this is extremely low effort compared to stuff that actually should be at the top
I remember when she said this
Post the shit outta this I will 100% upvote anything on reddit that supports HK.
It won't make a huge impact but I don't want to support this company
 I sold the shares I had.
Mei says hong kong rights
I hope that everyone here really understands what HK is fighting for and isn't just joining a bandwagon
She is a fictional character that blizzard created. She is definitely on the side of the communist party.

Alright.
I‚Äôm gonna fucking laugh when they introduce riot gear Mei skin
I'm not up to date on gaming, but when I see a bunch of posts on reddit surrounding deifying a cartoon character to the point of making them an idol to stand up for freedom.... doesn't that seem pretty belittling to those individuals that are actually suffering because of the situation? It's kinda like everyone that uses cartoon characters as the face of civil movement isn't taking any of this seriously. 

I honestly don't know who the fuck Mei is, but I can guarantee that putting a cartoon character in a political position is going to get no results, aside from a temporary 2-week bandwagoning movement on reddit.
Unpopular Opinion: Game Studios make games, not political statements.

A game company should not be dragged into a political debate against their will. Its not their job to take a stance, its their job to make games for people to enjoy. Gaming in itself is an escapism, and should make efforts to not correlate with recent events, political or otherwise. Make no mistake, in actuality, this has nothing to do with the Hong Kong protests. This could have been about anything on the political spectrum, and Blizzard would have acted accordingly. If someone uses a company as a platform for political expression, I think it is perfectly well within that companies right to take action against the individual; ESPECIALLY, if there is literally a rule in place that the individual fully, and knowingly violated.

Side note: I never thought about Mei this way, but damn, pajama Mei was hotter than I thought

This is why nobody takes gamers seriously. Using a video game character as a symbol for revolution is just gay.
Jeesh, I don't follow news much but it sounds like they are having a real humdinger over there. My uncle used to live there as a missionary priest...maybe they should just sell it back to British control, everybody wins.
\[The world could always use more heroes.\]([https://i.imgur.com/MT2Z7QK.png](https://i.imgur.com/MT2Z7QK.png))
she probably doesnts even know why they are protesting.  stupid ditz.

i'll have you know the British controlled  police in HK killed hundreds Hongkongers in 1967 when there was a protest against colonization. There was no democracy for 2nd class hongkongers under British rule.
Mei's VA actually supports China.

Partially why subverting her as a symbol of Hong Kong freedom is such a good idea.
What else can we do to send the message to Blizzard, China, and the rest of the world?
Remember! Blizzard does not condone any political activism of any kind!

I hope Blizzard sees how serious everyone is.
Come join this group, let's protest at blizzcon!

Wait up, so if a player says impeach trump... would that player have the same violation as asking for freedom for HK?
The other overwatch people need to do more
I'm not a gamer. But I want to say I am inspired with what you all are doing and I greatly appreciate it. Ya'll might be the voice that keeps this in the mainstream. It seems we're not allowed to talk about this issue and corporate media is gonna let it all slide away. Powerful people now control the story and can make it go away. Think about the major news stories that have happened this year:

* Robert Kraft - he visited a brothel that, lets face it, is probably way deep in the sex slave/sex trafficking trade.
* Epstein- we all know the story and how far-reaching that could have been.
* Hong Kong- we see that ESPN and the NBA have already closed their eyes.
* General Motors- a major United Auto Workers strike is happening right now. And guess who is saying nothing? The very networks that air GM commercials virtually every break.

&#x200B;

We are in deep folks. Please keep talking.
Memes don't matter unless you get the competitors and streamres to alsop join the protests.

As long as they keep making money they won't stop.
Can someone explain where this comes from ?
Can somebody explain this meme to me?
Blizzard introducing Mei's new voice lines: "Long live the Chinese government!" and "I love communism!"
Mei is no longer Chinese, just a thick white girl. Hope you guys are happy
We need more of these... Whe are about to end this company whole Career

I like how all these memes are effectively advertising a Blizzard game and making it seem like Blizzard isn‚Äôt the bad guy here.  

I‚Äôm sure blizzard loves the skin concepts too.  Gives them a way to literally profit off this PR shitshow.

Delete this now
If you or anyone your know plans on deleting their account, don't just delete your account! You can request your Data from Blizzard and if they dont follow trhough within 30 days they have to pay hefty fines inside the EU. If everyone does this, they might have such an enormous backlog and will have to pay up. More details here: https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfcncg/dont_just_delete_your_account_you_can_request/
Sadly, the voice actress likely doesn't share the same sentiment.

Pity.
I wonder if all the video game liberals will start to realize that censorship isn't so cool when its not them doing it.
Blizzard will have Mei say things like "I do not support Hong Kong protestors" during the game now.
didnt blizzard banned a HK supporter? hmm
War never ends
Fuck hong kong, so tired of reddit's current obsession
"Beyond The Grave!"
Please get the voice actor on record.
And we support you, Mei
Oh, hell yeah she does!
Is is actually the most childish way of protesting this

Honestly, this "Overwatch charachter supports Hong Kong in opposition to Blizzard's decision" feels like a cheap ploy. Blizzard would benefit from it if players used it as an excuse to keep playing their game.
We need to find a way to get this onto weibo where they'll all see this.
Blizzard can take their censorship and wipe their ass with it.
You know for the amount of overwatch porn out there it would be really cool if we could animate mei saying that in an actual video.
Slowly prepares my rifle in the middle of the jungle with Chinese money in my cross hairs.
I place my wallet on a log and aim.
Suddenly Blizzard peeks through the bush next to me.
"Clever girl".
I'm so proud of the gaming community for making a change!
All these Mei memes are just making me want to play overwatch
I am torn by my support for the protesters and my hatered for the piece of shit, cancer of a video game character that literally ruined that entire game for me.

gross, do u guys have to make everything political?
You: Low effort karma farming not actually doing anything for the people of Hong Kong.
I'm just confused people are trying to use something blizzard created against blizzard. Mei supports Hong Kong? No she doesn't Because she's not real and in reality supports Banning the player since overwatch is blizzard. Do people have brains?
This is so gay. Really, nerds? This is what you've come up with? A fucking cartoon character?
damn she look like someone i know, shoutout Doreen. you are awesome and beautiful
Thank you Mei, very cool.

Such a low effort post I can‚Äôt believe it gained traction. Like I support this movement but come on, this one took a minuscule amount of creativity and effort.
[removed]
This is some low quality posting
Every idiot in the West and their grandma supports the violent riots of the traitors in HK.

If you ask them how they justify that nonsense they repeat meaningless, vague shit about freedom and democracy like some American parrot.

Literally not a single person I ever talked to in the West knows what's going on and why. It's fucking brainwashing at its finest.

Nobody can justify their support for these assholes destroying the city and ruining innocent people's lives.

The US is trying to ruin another nation. Glad to see that all of what's happening made Chinese people more patriotic and more aware of American information warfare and propaganda.

The US is a fucking evil country.

If you are one of the idiots supporting these riots: Have you ever asked yourself why? Do you honestly believe the propaganda you see? Don't you feel like huge assholes for not fact-checking and educating yourself even a little bit? It's fucking evil.

Edit: Look at the insane and evil comments I get in return already.

1. A guy attacking me personally and trying to dismiss me for being "a Sino poster" as if there was anything wrong with that. Zero arguments, no justification, as literally every single person ever criticizing China on this website.       
2. A guy using a "both sides" argument to justify anti-Chinese aggression even thought there is no aggression of China against the US and no propaganda. The worst China does is call out hypocrisy, asking the US to stop and retaliating against some offenses of the US. The only government demonstrating aggression and information warfare is the US. In terms of information warfare, the worst thing China does is censor American propaganda. Which is fully justified.       
3. Another guy attacking me personally while spreading anti-Chinese memes. Once again, zero arguments given. Like all people spreading anti-Chinese propaganda. A completely insane and evil person spreading hatred and disinformation unwilling to justify himself. This is a typical American.

How do you reason with such levels of brainwashing if the people spreading disinformation and attacking you refuse to provide arguments and deny reasonable discourse?

[ameizing!!](https://i.imgur.com/pz4pzi4.jpg)
I swear I've seen that comment back when overwatch released, but for different reasons.

I mained Mei back then, Mai is bae.
Goddamnit we shoulda picked Doomfist
I mean I was in favour of the Hong Kong protestors anyway, but they'll remove Mei from gameplay if we use her as an icon? Double whammy win for me
Finally. The game is playable again.
that would be the best thing to come from this whole thing
Go get em girls!
And a high Social Credit Score will now be required as part of the authentication process for your login.
Blizzard: hey guys at least tracer is gay
Mei is definitely the best character to do this with, but should probably do it with Tracer too. Hell as many of the characters as possible, but Tracer is the flagship hero for Overwatch. She's the most popular by far. 

This analogy is not perfect, but its the difference in removing Mario vs Toad.
I wouldn't mind never again hearing her sorry voiceline after she decimates my team tho.
You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if they do this, at least in Chinese versions of the game

\#StandWithHK
As someone who doesn't play the game I wanna ask seriously: regarding all this brouhaha, is there any significance to the character other than her ethnicity? Because otherwise, I don't see what would stop people from doing similar things with other characters.
Also taking back anyone who won prize money using her.
Lol that would be hilarious honestly, the biggest FU of all time
She wasn‚Äôt forgotten at the base. She was abandoned there because of this.
i can relate and i would support Blizzard in this case.
To who?  Someone who never existed can't have references.
This was all just an elaborate long con to have Mei removed from overwatch.
Move on to tracer
I‚Äôd love to see them do that. That will fuck them so hard.
Who‚Äôs Mei? We‚Äôve never had a hero in Overwatch named Mei! Sounds like YOU need a trip to the re-education camp!
Win-win!
> We are taking away any prize winnings for anyone who played Mei. Upon further review we have found the action of playing Mei has violated the 2019 Overwatch Official Competition Rules section 6.1 (o) and is individual behavior which does not represent Blizzard or OverWatch Esports.
That lessons the power of the meme.
It'll settle in. Remember that memes are like genes, you get a big population of them and then the most fit memes survive and mutate.
Well it is a meme, it should be adaptable.
I vote for the versions up on r/Overwatch_Porn

\#StandWithHK
I'd prefer if Mei was used in the HK protests like Pepe. Just put her everywhere and in everything rather than limit her to one message
That's the opposite of useful for this issue.  What people need to do is use ALL of Blizzards characters to support Hong Kong.

Force China to ban Blizzard entirely.
If it was just one costume, they could theoretically remove it from the game without major consequences. If it‚Äôs the entire character, it‚Äôs a bit more difficult to deal with.
How else would they be able to get easy free karma
Uh, no. It‚Äôs not as interesting to spam the same image over and over. A variation in images conveys the popularity of the movement. Also, the message from these memes has been fairly consistent.

I mean what could they possibly say that is really defensible at this point? They already banned the player, stripped away his money, and fired the commentators. The likelihood that they reverse all of that is basically zero.

dicks out for mei
Best thing about this is that you don't have to be overly aggressive with China. A simple image of a Disney character is enough for them to lose their shit.
Or the classic Taiwan Numbah One!!!!
Something of her being teargassed or arrested would be great.
I posted this elsewhere, I'll post it here too:

Has no one considered that doing these Mei memes may endanger Mei's voice actor/family?

I'm all for protesting what occured, and what is happening in Hong Kong; but given how authoritarian regimes work, they may act against HER - and possibly her family - simply due to her association with the character; whether they are her true feelings or not.

Just food for thought.  I'd rather not see something bad happen to her because of this.
So you're giving up nothing. That's like a vegan boycotting Chick-fil-A.
You're so brave
This is trolling. Just because you have my opinion doesn't mean that this isn't a troll for attention that wants to start a fight.
And off is a tv channel
The Communist Chiness dictatorship started this. Don't be a commie lover
Gota love the pro commies turning a commie problem into a capitalist problem
I love how communists always have to find a way to make capitalism the bad thing, even though this entire problem started because of a communist country.
It's actually a Communism problem but ok
Way to railroad the discussion onto your particular issue of choice.
Remember that China's economic issues aren't a capitalism problem. It's a communist problem. The state will always be put ahead of people. Any totalitarian government organization will ALWAYS prioritize self-preservation.
What a stupid and economically illiterate comment.
Chinas not capitalistic though
Yes, but we do still want to have games lol.

The idea is to disincentive bad actions with monetary repercussions, as consumers or through govt. proxies. We can assume profit (in some form) will always be the motivating factor for achievement, no experiments has shown otherwise, the question should be what do we do with that knowledge.
Not exactly. The Communist Party of China led government has the power to outright ban Blizzard, NBA, whatever company from operating in China on the basis of people having different political opinions than the CCP because of their totalitarian system. If it were a free democratic country who believes in freedom of expression it wouldn‚Äôt have the same influence over these companies.

Yes, I blame the companies for bowing down to China, but at least in a free capitalist system we can do something about it, whether that be speaking out or boycotting. The CCP could put you in prison for that.
Considering that blizzard as a capitalist company has to compete for your dollar as well as with other businesses, this will reflect poorly on them and severely damage their profits unless they go do tons of damage control. In other words in order for blizzard to make money they need to make their customers happy, if they aren‚Äôt they go out of business.
Capitalism isn't perfect, but what alternative is there that would be better in this case?
Inb4 "reee that's not real communism". Yes yes it is. This is what you're fighting for. The death of liberty and personal choice and the birth of a new regime. Wake up comrade, you're hastening your own end under the boot heels of communist doctrine. That's what those brave souls in HK are fighting against, a world you want to condemn us all to
People are going to be shitty no matter your economic system sadly. Having regulations to protect consumers/citizens seems to be the best way to do things
Communist country: **kills and beats its own citizens, runs a organ harvesting concentration camp**

But what exactly is supposed to be implied by the "capitalism" part? In my mind, i see it as a multinational corporate greed issue, caused by governments failure to regulate the issue. Capitalism can be a useful way to describe a significant aspect of the issue. *But*, the only time i ever see it used is to swiftly posit that "Revolutions", "Eating the rich" and/or that "Communism/socialism" is the solution as well as the direct counter part to capitalism (In the communist way of thinking). We're kind of ***dealing with the fruits and end results of communist ideas here***

It doesn't seem possible to label it as a "Capitalism" problem, without everyone immediately linking it to communism solution.

So to sum it up, i feel that every time capitalism is mentioned, useful discourse breaks down as tankies and teenage idealists utterly overwhelm the discussion with violent rhetoric, political grandstanding and whataboutisms.  
Capitalism is an apolitical concept of obtaining wealth. Unchecked and unregulated, it's bad. I just can't really understand why peoples mode of thinking is limited to "Communism Vs capitalism" worldviews, when i feel human kind is a bit smarter and original than to cling on to naive 18th century utopian ideas into the year 2000
TFW you are so good at mental gymnastics that you can talk yourself into believing that the world's 2nd most powerful nation, and self-described communist (and still functionally semi-communist) nation coercing a private corporation into silencing speech about brutal political crackdowns is somehow captalism's fault, and not explicitly the fault of the totalitarian nation doing the coercing.
It's not a capitalism problem, it's the people inside the machine that are the problem.
Yeah, because censorship doesn't exist in any other economical model.
Commie
nah. blizzard bad. /s
Human nature, not capitalism
it isn‚Äôt only a capitalism problem either, it is an authoritarianism problem working with a captalist problem
Capitalism on one side and Authoritarianism on the other
Well, companies need to start understanding that siding with brutal dictatorships is not a good business. Hard to do , but we can¬¥t just sit back and take it.
Just go away, seriously, communist regimes are some of the most corrupt in the world.
shut up tankie
Capitalism is the best system we've come up with so far.

It has it's issues, nobody is disagreeing with that. But honestly I have yet to know of a system that has  worked as well as it capitalism has. It has yet to be proven inferior to another economic system.

Idk about you but I'm pretty happy living in a Capitalist society, no forced labor camps, nobody forcibly removing my internal organs, life is good.
The only reason blizzard did what they did is because of the **communist** state of China. Tencent has Blizzard by the balls
Lol. Classic communist
There is no ethical consumption under capitalism
This is a huge non-argument. You can't just search out a specific subreddit where people talk about news around this specific company and then drop something that completely shifts the discussion. You are ~~deliberately~~ shifting the discussion from "customers and others are voicing their anger at actions from a company" to "companies in a capitalist system are inherently immoral". *Edit, this was apparently not deliberate, sorry*


That's not the point here, because the way you post it and the timing of it only helps to keep that status quo. Instead of making people doubt capitalism, you only normalise it and help the criticism towards individual companies pass over more easily. You are the grease that makes sure criticism towards individual companies will not stick. 


This might seem like an ad homimem and it is. I won't call you schoolyard insults but I do feel like I need to call this out, I feel like you are approaching this ~~either~~ in the wrong way ~~or downright disingenuous.~~ There is nothing wrong with campaigning against a single company or getting upset at a single immoral act more companies do because it still shows cracks. If the genuine results are not in the changes made by a company, they are in finding more allies. 


People are better at seeing individual processes they disagree with than the entire economic system they are comfortable with out of familiarity. The best way to get people motivated is still a single cause, but for those motivated it leaves a lasting impact. With how open you are about your motives, I'd advise you to not say "it happens everywhere" but use this case as an argument against worldwide capitalism. If the list of cases becomes too long to put in a reddit comment, congratulations : you've only made your point stronger and can feel more righteous about wanting an alternative to capitalism.
You heard Riot censored some Hong Kong stuff too, right?
A hearthstone player shouted for freedom for HK on blizzards post game stream after a tournament.  This was against their rules so Blizzard banned them.

A lot of people on the internet got super offended and made the mental leap that this means Blizzard supports genocide
Surprised it took them that long
Look at me. I am de canon now.
Gyna?
"Hey the last guy was bad so you should just accept literally any mistreatment by a different expansionist imperial power."

Why not just leave Hong Kong tf alone?
[removed]
Why would they give a shit how their message gets out there? The people on the ground in Hong Kong want their message out there, they won't care how or why.  It's about getting the spotlight on the suffering they experience at the hands of mainland China.
You sound like Blizzard.
Found the Xi minion
People care about the message, but aren't super interested in the comments. Easy all scroll by upvote.
They're trying to make it into a symbol specifically so that it will get banned from China, thus forcing blizzard to take more action one way or the other. 

I don't think anyone is using this to belittle those protesters who are risking their very lives in HK, it's just a way to force blizzard into action.
Uncle Sam.
They made their stance when they issued an over-the-top punishment. If the player in question had just been warned, or even disqualified from the current event, no one would have a problem. The problem is they banned him from a year, took back his earnings from the entire SEASON, AND banned the casters who were just taking part in the interview. 

It was so over the top that it was an obvious statement to china that "no we don't support this"
When a company bans a streamer for supporting the protesters, they've made a political statement. They weren't "dragged into a political debate against their will," they jumped in.
> Game Studios make games, not political statements.

Bro have you *played* video games
Life is political, get used to it.
Already done in another thread
And no one will take your comment seriously because of your usage of gay.
Actually, a lot of people are boycotting Blizzard to show solidarity with Hong Kong, and it has turned into an international incident almost. The money is talking, and it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not being spent. More public attention on Hong Kong, Americans seeing things about Hong Kong, and seeing an American company betray a collective ideal may be the first step into our government acting and attempting to negotiate an independent Hong Kong.
Why are you here if you don't understand what's going on?
Sadly, she's on China's side.
And how come every comment only has 1 point
I have no idea
I give it til October 11th before everyone runs out of meme ideas and stops giving a shit
Because I still have achievements I need to earn In WoW.
Because everything is political.
yes, Blizzard made it political first, this is a very good reply.
I think there hoping that if China gets offended by Mei they would ban overwatch, which would hurt Blizzard
IQ 0
meijor shoutout doreen
It‚Äôs so annoying dude
>Since you guys are protesting blizzard you guys are protesting your government,Disney and so on? No your not lol

I'ma need you to say that again but in English this time.
What a stupid argument this is. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worthless to protest a great injustice if you don‚Äôt also protest every other injustice.‚Äù
Nothing in life is free sweatie, if you want gold pick up a sickle and hammer like everyone else.
New account for 4 days. What made you decide to make a account?
Yeah I support the message but this looks like someone's grandma posted it on Facebook
Oh look a Sino poster.
30 day old account in support of lying, communist, thieving China? No way this is a troll, guys. Put the pitchforks down.
The people of China are being sent to work camps, the people of China have every single move they make being monitered, the people of China are losing their jobs by just making criticisms on the Chinese government.  
  
The people of China aren't free in China and Hong Kong simply wants to not be a part of China. Even if that means mass protests.
There is propoganda on both sides. And both sides are call each other evil, you know
You sound like the one that's brainwashed haha
ugh, always gets me
Ugh I really needed to see this. I‚Äôve been so overwhelmed with the sheer and overwhelming evil that‚Äôs being uncovered and publicly announced all over the world. From Trumps America, Russia, China and their genocide of Muslims along with their treatment of HK, the pedophiles and sex slave trade run by the worlds most powerful, the corporate stranglehold over my government. Thanks for this. There is some good left. It‚Äôs important to remember that.
It‚Äôs shrimp.
NBA already went against that shit... although might've been because of TOO MUCH pushback from China. Disney ofc won't do a thing, because so much profits. 

I'd like to see more to come, because it means they're getting public with that shit, rather than just dealing in the shadows. We all know most big shit bows to china, but to come in public like this? That's awesome to see.
How Chinese see the world can be summarized by a Chinese proverb, "ÊôÆÂ§©‰πã‰∏ãÔºåËé´ÈùûÁéãÂúüÔºõÁéáÂúü‰πãÊø±ÔºåËé´ÈùûÁéãËá£‚Ä≥,which means the world, including land and people, is the property owned by the emperor of China.
The NBA already went against China and therefore resulted in big china companys pulling their relation with the NBA. Good on the NBA for that one.
Technically you‚Äôre right. Hong Kong has nothing to do with China anymore :p
I deleted it
Whoops, lol
I don't see anything.
ASCII what you did there
dang, beat me to it.
[removed]
That's the biggest issue for me. They didn't just penalize the guy who made them look bad. They nuked everyone in the frame. Completely disproportionate. It goes right past trying to keep politics out of your gaming stream, straight into kowtowing to fascists. Unacceptable.
**Breaking News:** Valve has offered all of the teams behind Mei's creation jobs at their company and have invited Mei to join the TF2 roster
"And have rescinded all of their pay"
We are removing Blizzard for having such a character.
And banning any player who ever played her
"We apologize for  the fault in this characters design. The animators and design team have been sacked. Those responsible for sacking the people who have been sacked have also been sacked"
Why do that when you can just kill all of them and harvest their organs?
Zerg stand with Hong KOng!!!
Is this true or am I gonna get "wooooshed"?
We are even terminating the company that created her... Ohwaitfuckshitno.
In a effort to stay true to our ideals of freedom and tolerance, we will compensate our Hong Kong firings by introducing a pansexual demigender character. Also they are in a wheelchair.
Don‚Äôt give them any ideas
Ya wanna know what's a better protest? Cancel your sub. Stop giving Blizzard your money.
Even if you don't have a pandaren character you can still protest.
Wow was banned in China due to Wrath and the skeletons. It was unbanned around MoP. Hmmmmm
Exactly, and China isn't going to ban Blizzard for one character.  

#But if ALL characters from all Blizzard games are used, there's no chance Blizzard gets to stay in that market.
I definitely wanted her deleted sometime around release
*lessens
No it doesn't, it strengthens it. Gives it more focus.
This.  Next thing you know people will be saying how much people in China and HK "love to main Mei".
It won't settle in easily though. China's internet is very effectively isolated from the west. It's going to take a strong commitment to make this work.
Somebody should write a book about that...
Dudes find a pencil and really think they can do anything I suppose
Missed one, thanks bud.
Normally you're right but for something like this you really need ONE image to be spread. Like that picture of Putin in drag.
It's not about that really...

I've been seeing a ton of them, and many don't make sense. Out of context I wouldn't know what's being made fun of. Those ones aren't helping the cause, unless it's in spreading the characters popularity, bringing attention to her in general.
Maybe the blizz ceos arent putting out any pr because theyre busy blowing all the money on coke and hookers ... since they know the company is toast no matter what.
They publicaly apologized though... to the chinese government
**Technically** right
There is always hope! The commentators did nothing wrong, they should be allowed to continue working. Blitzchung displeased the chinese crowd but he won his earnings fair and square as he is not a cheater. The ban for 1 year is ridiculous and should be lifted. Hearthstone is a GAME, let the kid play ffs ! Silence his microphone if you must and put a disclaimer that opinions expressed by contestants are their own and does not reflect the companies ideas. That should be good enough.
this didnt age well
This will keep on going until they address the issue for sure. EA's reputation was permanently stained in the same fashion.
Honk Kong has stood defiant for MONTHS.   We must keep this up.

Can you live without freedom of speech?
The beautiful fragility of the authoritarian ego
Their leader is a bear of very little brain indeed.
Ehh, I mean does it really matter? Gatekeeping people from showing support because they have nothing to give up is a slippery slope. 


Saying "you dont own any Blizzard games so you cant be apart of this" is dangerously close to saying "you're not from Hong Kong so you cant be apart of this"


Not exactly the same but a protest that gatekeeps is one that eventually loses support
Braver than our troops literally shaking rn
They've been capitalist for decades, dude. Try to keep up. How do you think private American corporations are operating in "communist" China in the first place?
who are the Chiness?
Anti-capitalism =/= pro-communism
It's capitalists putting money over human rights that banned the player. China's government is bad, but that doesn't excuse western companies that bow to their demands. 

Also, China is not communist. It's state-controlled capitalism with the profits going directly to the state. It's a mixed system.
Democratic People's Republic of Korea is bad and has "democratic" in its name democracy is terrible
What part of their comment seemed to be in support of communism? Fascistic communism (like in China) is bad, but so is oligarchal capitalism. You're allowed to criticize one without being "in love" with the other.
The CCP is authoritarian, and not communist (by their own admission ‚Äú2 systems one China‚Äù). Don‚Äôt equate socialism with them.
Oh please.  China is a capitalist country with an authoritarian government.
Lol China is Communist the same way North Korea is Democratic People's Republic.

If it was communist it wouldn't have more billionaires than any other country. You think the workers there own the means of production? lol no
No the State Capitalist Chinese Dictatorship started this. 

When you try to conflate issues like this you just give the guilty parties a way to misdirect and funnel anger away. Call out them for what they are, not what your rhetoric would like them to be.
"Communists are poor!  Breadline Bernie breadline bernie!!!  "

"China is too wealthy and is becoming too big of a global market force!"
>Implying China is actually communist instead of a capitalist dictatorship.
Who decided to ban that player and take his money? Did China do that, or did blizzard?
The problem is that blizzard banned the player and took his winnings. Did China do that or did Blizzard do that?
The problem is fundementally that Blizzard is willing to side against human rights if it makes them money.

That is a problem caused purely by corporate greed.
Who made the decision to ban him and take his money? Did Communism do that, or did blizzard?
So discussing the root of the motivation of their decision is not relevant to the discussion?
China is in no way, shape or form communist. It's authoritarian state capitalism by definition.
That applies to any "NATION STATE" as is laid out in many foreign policies. Self-preservation of the nation-state at all costs, above and beyond even human rights.
Ever hearing of Deng Xiaoping my dude?
Are you implying that capitalism cannot have that issue? Because capitalist countries are suffering the same issues. The only difference is that instead of the state being priority, the top 100 people in the country are priority. 


It‚Äôs no different. You simply shift power from the government to the billionaires when you switch from communism to capitalism.
We have issues with both. Youre both right and both wrong. We understand. Do we still need these petty finger pointing comments?
Now you realise that government and business are two heads of the same disgusting ogre magi that have to be cut at the same time to kill the beast. You're arguing whether Cho or Gall are the enemy; Cho'gall is.
China is not communist...
China being a communist nation is exactly what they want you to believe.
Communism, political and economic doctrine that aims to replace private property and a profit-based economy with public ownership and communal control of at least the major means of production (e.g., mines, mills, and factories) and the natural resources of a society.


China is in no way communist at all please stop spreading this false information and educate yourself. 


**China is a capitalist fascist nation.**
China is communist like how North Korea is democratic, they're not and they just pretend they are to fool braindead tankies and dipshit reactionaries. That said, you are correct that any totalitarian government will always prioritize self preservation over the well-being of its people, and China is definitely totalitarian.
I hope you don't believe that my critique of capitalism is the same as an approval of China's behaviors. That would be incredibly short-sighted and narrow-minded of you. But I don't think that's what you meant.

But you are right about power and it's goal of self-preservation. That's exactly why we need to progress towards a stateless, classless, and moneyless society. Power to the people, comrade.
How so?
It absolutely is.

Or do you think North Korea is a Democracy?
How exactly, with it's billionaires?
We are talking about Blizzard. Blizzard is operated out of California. China can't put blizzard in jail for not bowing to their pressure. It was the "free capitalist" company's decision to ban that player because they have a single goal that is not motivated by human rights or any sense of morality. Under capitalism, corporations exist to make money. So that's what they did.
Or they could just ignore us and make money from China? Why would they care about some people online who are mad if it doesn't impact their bottom line. 

I hope it does. But usually companies will do bad things and then ignore outrage because the public has a short attention span
Didn't capitalism motivate blizzard to make their decision?
We aren't talking about the overall merits of two countries. We're talking about this specific situation.
Blizzard made the decision to ban the player and fire the casters because they value the money from the Chinese market over human rights. 

Not hard to understand.
100% with you on this. It seems there can be zero criticism of capitalism without the solution being a 180 flip to communism, as if one is the opposite of the other, rather than 2 separate economic systems. For a long time now criticism of capitalism marked u as a communist, which isn‚Äôt true, but now people are un ironically turning to communism as the only answer. 

I am an American and a Democrat, I personally don‚Äôt want communism. What I want is the system we have now, but with much stronger regulations, and much more accountability for the big politicians and corporations for things like lobbying, conflicts of interest, corporate mergers etc etc. 

In my opinion we are doing a terrible job with our system and we need to be doing a lot more and a lot better, but that doesn‚Äôt mean communism is the only way to go, IMO that is far from the only options we have. And as long as we can‚Äôt criticize capitalism without being seen as communists and without resorting to communism, nothing will change. 

As it is right now, criticizing capitalism gets u marked as a communist, and ironically a lot of people who don‚Äôt like capitalism are turning to communist ideas, which is fulfilling the very wrong idea that ‚Äúcriticism of capitalism = communism‚Äù.
> dealing with the fruits and end results of communist ideas here

EXACTLY, its mind boggling that someone would say "well they should move towards communism" when that is exactly why they are in the awful humanitarian situation they are
Why did blizzard make the decision? What exactly was The leverage that China had over them?
The machine is a good analogy. But what is the capitalist machine built to do? How many times have we replaced the pilot? The machine has one goal: you need to make more money this quarter than you did last quarter. That's it. We don't need a new operator. We need to dismantle the machine.
Technically that's true. Capitalism is just a tool that people use. It does not have motive or desire.

That being said, the point of capitalism is to accrue money and power. It's considered excusable to value such things over individual rights and freedoms. Because that's not the end goal of capitalism.
Capitalism encourages the problems of the people inside the machine.  It's a feature, not a bug.
The people inside the machine are following the incentives that capitalism creates.
It does. But shareholder systems and the expectation of everlasting growth have a part in those decisions.
Not being a commie. But this is how capitalism is
Apt.
Not being a commie is lame
Blizzard is literally the "side" that made the authoritarian decision.
Hey oh, I'll be the first one to be thrilled if it has any effect. But sadly in an economic system that rewards money making behavior no matter the consequence, I'm not optimistic.
And communist regimes are exactly what HK is protesting against! China's Communist totalitarian government IS THE PROBLEM HERE 

How dare they suggest that capitalism is the problem, it is exactly communism that has caused this crisis in the first place.
You clearly haven‚Äôt been paying attention to this administration or Trump himself at least since the 70s
Of course you're happy, those things aren't happening to YOU. You were born into capitalism and educated by capitalism. Don't you think it's suspicious that you can't imagine any other formation of society? I mean listen to yourself.

"I'm not a slave so I guess things are okay"

Meanwhile we are growing increasingly depressed, alienated, and suicidal because we live in a world that is ruled by pursuit of profit over human needs. We are capable of so much more. But the fact is, whenever people band together to try and reclaim that better world for themselves they're met with brutal retaliation. (Look at Hong Kong)

The people that own things want to continue owning them. Accumulation of wealth through capitalism ensures they have the power to do so.
On what measure is it a superior system? If you are lucky enough to be born into the winning country that has the most support of the economic powerhouses exploiting a majority of the world's population beyond your shores, you will live a better life by most metrics.

There are plenty of capitalist economic systems with forced labor camps in the world. When the forces of capitalism are left unchecked, their power monopolizes into an effectively totalitarian regime, like the East India Company in SE Asia.
Are you saying that the ownership of Blizzard can't make their own decisions? Is there some kind of other force that they are compelled to align with? Like say, the pursuit of profit?
Do you think there was anything wrong with what I said?
You've put a lot of words in my mouth. In no way did I ever say or try to suggest that Blizzard shouldn't be called out specifically as well as addressing the actual motivations of their decision.

I have to ask though. If I asked you to pull weeds from a garden, would you snip the stem or dig out the roots?
Yeah, but i stopped playing their shit a while ago
I don't get it lmao they're just trying to keep politics out of their game no? It doesn't seem like the correct platform to protest? Very odd
Hong Kong was a part of China until Britain invaded and established a colony during the Opium Wars.

You know, the war where Britain went to war with China to force them to buy opium.
This needs to be repeated everytime someone says WELL THE BRITISH DIDN'T GIVE THEM ANY RIGHTS EITHER
Yes, it matters that people who are taking action in any way understand what they are taking action for.
Thank you for answering that! But, I do have another question now... how is  getting a gaming developer banned going to help with the movement? I'm sorry if I seem disingenuous, I'm genuinely curious in how Blizzard is related to the movement in HK. For someone that doesn't game, the logic behind this escapes me.
They had no choice but to make a stance; and I honestly don't think they did anything wrong. Like I said, this could have been about anything; this could have been about marijuana legalization, gay rights, abortion, doesn't matter. Either way, Blizzard was forced to act, and I don't think they did anything wrong. They literally created a rule for this; a rule the player fully and knowingly violated. If someone uses a companies creation as a platform to spread their political affiliations, they shouldn't be upset when the company decides to act in its best interests.
Lets play a game of hypothetical's shall we?

Lets say one day you and a friend are walking in the park and witness a fight between two individuals. Your friend, without thinking, jumps into the middle of the fight. In the end, one of two original individuals ends up badly hurt, and the authorities are called in to investigate. They begin asking you questions about the fight, and more-over the extent of your involvement. Are you supposed to support your friend and involve yourself, or leave your friend to face his own actions? I'm pretty sure the choice is obvious.
<.< I'm honestly not sure how to answer your infinitely idiotic question.
Oh yeah, it totally is. Thats all my friends talk is politics. When I go to the grocery store, I make sure to spend 30 minutes in line debating politics with the cashier. I talked politics with the cop that pulled me over for speeding last week. I chew politics online with the guys I play Call of duty with. Some of my absolute best debates have happened with my spouse while we were playing hide the salami.
So you don‚Äôt take homosexuals seriously?
Do we know this for sure?

*I Wanted To Change The World*

When I was a young man, I wanted to change the world.

I found it was difficult to change the world, so I tried to change my nation.

When I found I couldn't change the nation, I began to focus on my town. I couldn't change the town and as an older man, I tried to change my family.

Now, as an old man, I realize the only thing I can change is myself, and suddenly I realize that if long ago I had changed myself, I could have made an impact on my family. My family and I could have made an impact on our town. Their impact could have changed the nation and I could indeed have changed the world.

Could you, for one second, just one issue, stop projecting your expectations for what Trump is and conflating him with every bad thing.

Trump supporters are some of the most fervent advocates for Hong Kong and opponents of the Chinese censorship state. Just one day at least could you find solidarity on a shared issue, go back to hatred tomorrow.
This has nothing to do with Trump lol, communist China is the enemy,and Russia is just irrelevant because they aren't as much of a threat as China
Trumps america is great, things are actually going pretty well for me (for once in my life). :D

Any reason for the hate beyond orange man bad?

But, If you think that Hong Kong is not a part of China, then a Chinese character shouldn‚Äôt have any relationship with the Hong Kong protest.
Rule of thumb is: they're not there to mark when you took a breath, but for grammar. They're also not a semicolon replacement.

Fucking fired the interviewers for interviewing. Imagine being arrested for murder because you were a witness too a murder.
"Fascism" is a fancy way of saying "Right back to the middle ages" and it appalls me how many people think it's a good direction for anyone but the Royal Parasite class.
In the most devils of advocates, the casters did encourage him to say the thing.
"Nerf this!"
Sounds like the communist thing to do to me.
Holup, the interviewers were blizzard employees?
Perfect example of Blizzard adopting the guilt-by-association scare tactics that totalitarian regimes like China enforce.
It's mafia tactics. It's telling players that they won't just reap the consequences, but also the innocent bystanders in the crossfire.
Why even bother working with Blizzard as a caster if some random no can just scream Free Hong Kong and you lose your job. 

How in the hell will anyone at Blizzard still be employed after Blizzcon? I guarantee there will be a bunch of random signs behind caster booths throughout the entire day with "Free Hong Kong"
These are communists not fascists,  dont down vote me its an important distinction
Honestly, pretty sure Valve would cave to China's demands as well. I think they already have with Dota in one way or another. Corporations gonna corporate.

No, if everything Mei is a meme then Mei herself, not just a specific image, becomes a meme.
I don't necessarily like it but as soon as a game becomes big enough to have global followings, tournaments, and big prizes it is no longer just a game. It's a business product and the product owner (Blizz) is going to look out for their bottom line.

What will be interesting to see is if anything actually happens from the fallout. I'd like to guess "Yes" but the optimistic view has been taking a beating lately.
> Blitzchung displeased the chinese crowd but he won his earnings fair and square as he is not a cheater.

Is this not grounds for a lawsuit of some sort?
[deleted]
>The commentators did nothing wrong

Well, they did encourage Blitzchung. I give props to them for risking their careers but I don't think it was "professional".
EA tried to cover for themselves but now look at NBA 2020 casino simulation and surprise mechanics. It was all bull. We can't trust blizzard either.
This is not just about Hong Kong (do not doubt my support) but freedom of speech for all. Blizzard has Chinese interests. China says "Make an example of this guy" and they jump. 

Many western governments have Chinese interests. Imagine if China could tell them to make an example of you.

Hang Long Dong for Dang Hong Kong
He signed a contract to not say anything politically controversial. What made it worse was that he put on a gas mask and support anti HK movement instead of an interview after his stream competition. Blizzard is shit but they punished him fairly .
LMFAO yeah so much more brave to post an anonymous comment on the internet than to get shot at...
**TLDR:** Chinese Maoist collectivism pressuring Western Capitalists. We can place the balance of blame however we like with that in mind.
China is authoritarian.  Not communist. If it was communist "the people" would truly be the decision makers.
If I go on overwatch and say ‚Äúfuck the blacks‚Äù and get banned... do I blame blizzard or do I blame myself ?
The problem is that CCP can pressure Blizzard to ban someone. The root of the problem is Chinese government, not capitalism.
The fact you can speak out against Blizzard can and probably will lead to change. This is called the free market. If you were in China, you would have no recourse, without great risk. The risk coming from communism to the individual. In the case of blizzard they have acted at great risk to their company, not the individual, because capitalism and the free market allows for the individual to group against a company, whereas Communism obliterates any free thinking or speech.
Yes. There are plenty of companies that don't do this, so I think criticizing capitalism as the root of the problem is kind of off topic.
So fascism really. Private enterprise exists, but only with the state's blessing and allowance. That sort of explicit choosing of winners based on loyalty to the state is a hallmark of fascism.

And although it's not a required aspect of a fascist state, China's got the ethnic cleansing going on, too. They really like to buy into the full package.
No true communist fallacy. They denied anyone who wasn't a communist from even participating in government for over a decade. The situation you have described has arisen from them trying to salvage their country from the dismal failure of communism. 

They aren't purely communist NOW because they have started to accept some free market ideals to, ya know SURVIVE.
You are totally right. After Tinanmen a bunch of capitalist economists from Chicago got their go at China's economy and this is what ensued

> authoritarian state capitalism 

Well that just sounds like Socialism with extra steps.
Do people on reddit actually believe this?
Look, I hate capitalism as much as the next pal, but at some point you do have to admit that communism isn‚Äôt a panacea and that, Soviet-Era Russian jokes about ‚Äúthe true Communism‚Äù aside, authoritarianism can twist any economic system.
The "authoritarian state" part of authoritarian state capitalism (a term I only hear when I see tankies defending China not being True Communism) makes it capitalism about as much as "National Socialist" makes the National Socialist Party actual socialists.
Only because of the Simpsons
Dude that i responded to literally said that the socioeconomic problems facing a country that has tried communism harder than almost any other country ever has are the fault of capitalism, that kind of mindless propaganda deserves a rebuttal.
cyka blyat da comrade
Communist Party of China does horrible shit and strongarms Western companies to do business with them.

>omg it‚Äôs capitalism‚Äôs fault

‚ÄúBut the CCP isn‚Äôt communist‚Äù - since I know you‚Äôre going to use that argument. Technically, yes. However the entire party was founded under Communism (it‚Äôs in the name for a reason) and it follows a lot of its traditions and customs from its history. Blaming capitalism for these types of issues is really ignorant.
‚ÄúCommunist party of China‚Äù
Mostly Government controlled businesses, insanely high taxes, authoritarian government, insanely high government spending/financial support.
Did you even read what I said? It can‚Äôt put Blizzard in jail but the CCP has the power to ban Blizzard from operating in China over a political stance on free expression. That can only happen because the totalitarian CCP is in power.

> Yes, I blame the companies for bowing down to China, but at least in a free capitalist system we can do something about it, whether that be speaking out or boycotting. The CCP could put you in prison for that.
I would say greed motivated them. Capitalism has birthed the greatest nations and innovations the world has ever known. Communism stifles innovation and leads to mass starvation. It assumes that someone has the right to take what I've earned and give it to someone who didnt earn it in the name of equality. Communism says that you get to decide what me and my family needs and doesnt need, what we are and arent allowed to have. Communism is, in a word, evil
And this specific situation is in response to those factors.
Their entire investment into the Chinese gaming market.
" The machine has one goal: you need to make more money this quarter than you did last quarter. "

If you're publicly traded maybe. I work for a small business that's been making roughly the same profits for a decade, we provide a service people appreciate and are well compensated for it. Yet it seems you would say this to is somehow a bad thing?
I say we focus less on the Capitalist vs Socialist/Communist debate. Let the people of Hong Kong decide what works best for them in that regard and we lend them the support they need. We can argue that for ourselves later. The only thing that sort of talk seeks to do right now is incite division, when we ought to be united in support of HK.
That‚Äôs not how this works. Capitalism functions because it‚Äôs a two way system. A business will fail if people don‚Äôt buy from it.
Thankfully all of the pilots of the communist machines have already crashed them into the side of a geopolitical mountain. That‚Äôs why there are no more communist societies and why they inevitably fail. Communism doesn‚Äôt work, sorry. You‚Äôre young and naive, go read a history book and live out your communism fantasy internally. That way we don‚Äôt have to starve because of your idiocy.
No, capitalism doesn't encourage anything. It allows us to function as a free market. People who exploit it encourage problems inside the machine.
and there isn't anything wrong with that picture. the people who wish to fracture, exploit and dismantle it are creating problems for the rest of us. THEY are the ones who need to be held responsible. You ever try to play a board game with someone and they try to be sly and screw you over? Are you just going to throw the whole board game away and say the rules are broken?
So it's not a capitalism problem. Got it.
Stop trying to hijack this to push communism.
Big gay
Capitalist countries like [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn) and [the US](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/27/754777224/u-s-companies-in-china-get-caught-in-the-trade-war-crossfire) work hand in hand with the CCP and have been since the 1970s. If you just blame communism because that‚Äôs the name of the ruling party you‚Äôll miss the point, companies can deflect all the blame on the CCP and the system won‚Äôt change. 

The CCP cracks down on [Marxist students](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/21/669509554/in-china-the-communist-partys-latest-unlikely-target-young-marxists) harder because they actually challenge their political power and corruption. The guys waving British and American flags play into their propaganda that the protesters are CIA assets who want to return China to the 19th century where Westerners rule the country via colonies and threats of invasion.
I'll happily take the word from friends and my own experiences who did business in China or of friends who lived under the Iron Curtain and what they had to go through, than listening to your Trump conspiracy theories.
Okay so what do you suggest, you've obviously ascended some form of intellectual barrier that the other 300 million people in the U.S. couldn't, so enlighten me.
Yes, what‚Äôs going on in China is not the fault of capitalism. The government controls their market, it‚Äôs not a free market. The government decides what their people can and can‚Äôt put their money in. It‚Äôs a fake economy built off their communist government.
I am sorry for writing it such a way you think I said you are *not against the practices happening now*. I only meant that your comment shifts the discourse to something less tangible and in general, such comments actually have an adverse effect. That's why I used "wrong way to deal with it", I only once said it might even be disingenuous, I take that back.  I also said deliberately, I take that back as well. 

Still, I think this is a poor analogy because you know in that case what's the best answer and expect me to answer that as well. Of course taking the roots out is the permanent solution, but when I have a plant with poisonous berries I will be happy with just cutting at the stem so I can get rid of it. Your analogy works because the roots of the problem go very deep and of course you should try to tackle the real world issue at the roots. 

I'm happy you use a root example instead of something like a disease, because I've seen people call it a symptom and actually kill any discussion afterwards because they've then called it "just a symptom". 

But to play along with the analogy would pull the roots as far as possible, but I would not discuss using a plough because there might be some roots or seeds left. In this real world scenario, the roots are such an incredible black box that the only practical thing to do is cut at the stem and make sure it can't spread their seed.

Edit: To continue the analogy I feel that if you spend too much time discussing how to get the roots out, you might accidentally forget that above the ground, they are still weeds and spreading their seeds.
Yeah -  that would be the rational explanation.  They don‚Äôt want to people to use their platform for controversial content and especially not something that would piss off a lot of their customers.

But social justice warriors would rather view it as a company being in bed with an authoritarian regime.


I think a lot of this probably harkens back to American exceptionalism as well.  By any objective America has been a shit show the past few years but it‚Äôs it‚Äôs convenient to find a target that‚Äôs slightly worse to distract you from your own shitty situation.

Common propaganda technique as well which is why all the us politicians are frothing at the mouth over it.
Oh wow, someone aced World History in high school. Wtf does Britain even have to do with the current situation? And Hong Kong's residents evidently do not want to go back to being a part of China regardless of their history.

Self-determination and Consent of the Governed are fundamental to any government system. China has neither in this case on their side. Maybe make a point that's actually relevant to what's going on?
Well if we want to get technical, HK was part of the Qing Empire, itself a foreign Manchurian dynasty that conquered China invading from the north. So it was under foreign rule anyway, just changes owners from barbarians from the north to barbarians from the west.
the logic is that blizzard is supporting china over HK based on the massive overreaction they had to the support HK statement the player made on stream. I guess overall it's trying to show US companies that there ARE consequences to taking money over supporting free speech and human rights.
> when the company decides to act in its best interests.

That right there is what people are mad about. This is about showing US companies that there are consequences for choosing profit over human rights and free speech
How did they have no choice but to do what they did?  Couldnt they have just said that the views of the gamer involved do not represent the views of blizzard?  They chose to make a political statement, one that shouldve been obvious to them would not go over well with their customera
>Either way, Blizzard was forced to act, and I don't think they did anything wrong. They literally created a rule for this; a rule the player fully and knowingly violated. 

You have a valid point and Blizzard is entitled to take whatever actions be it socio-political-$$$ but I have the right to respond to their actions.

 
Honestly their approach was horrible, they could have handled it differently and reduced the burns. PR press saying, we don't host games for ppl to shout out politics. This is about gaming and unifying our love for it bridging our divide.... As for the commentators... just keep them hired but never host again till it blows over.... there are so many approaches to handle this. The realization is how much China told the company what to do... a US company(so far)
This comparison makes no sense but alright.
Blizzard‚Äôs disciplinary actions are the equivalent of the authorities throwing everyone in jail for being involved. Even the bystanders.

He didn‚Äôt use profane language. He is a young person that lives and breaths turmoil because of this current conflict. His words did not warrant the reaction he received.

China is using soft power to manipulate international corporations. Their censorship exceeds their own borders. That‚Äôs the core issue.
What? Your hypothetical depends on having no context for the fight, which we currently have in this real-world situation. Siding with a government to make more money on the backs of the oppressed is wrong, and if my hypothetical friend defended that I would not support them.
Video games have been political since the inception of the medium. Game studios being the ones making the games, they are the ones making the political messages.
Your reply seems to be sarcastically facetious, so my advice to you is this; perhaps you should be a little more interested in politics.  Whether you are aware of it or not, politics are the rules that create the framework by which you, me, our peers, our neighbors, businesses, industries, and all other groups are allowed to live, function and interact within society.  An individual may be able to hide themselves from the influence of politics, but a business or corporation will sooner or later be confronted with a political situation; that's the nature of our society- it's inevitable.

&#x200B;

On a related note, businesses and human rights have been intertwined since their existence, so this is especially inevitable, if that makes linguistic sense.

I wonder how mods about Blizzard's support of fascism.  I'd feel pretty shitty if the company I spend time supporter turned out to be pro-fascism.

But they'll probably just import some fascists from /r/sino to do it.  They are happy to stomp on their fellow citizens, they won't care at all about Blizzard fans.

^(Am I allowed to do this?)
Except they weren't just "interviewing," they blatantly lead into the answer by asking BlitzChung if he had 8 words to say.
They had a few seconds to make a snap decision. Punish the guy who premeditated his political statement, not the people who got out of his way.
Ah yes by hiding and ducking underneath their desk they have encourage it from Blitzchung.

Riiiiiight.
If a society is butchering its ruling class and causing famines through agricultural mismanagement, I call that society communist.

If a society is butchering minorities and using the tools of the state to concentrate power and wealth in very few, I call it fascist.

The CCP used to do one of those things. It now does the other. They went from being communists to being fascists, and the difference is very important.
They were paid by Blizzard, but they were basically content creators rather than employees.
Nobody except the CCP thinks the Chinese government is communist. If they were butchering the ruling class and mismanaging agriculture to cause famines, I'd call them communists. Since they're nationalizing industries as a form of social control and butchering minorities while concentrating wealth and power with a tiny fraction of the population, I call them fascists.
They already do. A few years ago they fired a Dota 2 caster mid tournament because it was in China, and the Chinese bitched about him.

They held The International in China this year, and it was an absolute shit show, because the chinese don't fucking care about anyone who isn't chinese.
Valve is big into China right now. Their user numbers had been stagnant for a while - they made an aggressive push into China last year and opened up Steam to Chinese users officially, which gave them a big boost in player numbers.

They don't want to lose that. It's the only growth they have since they already own most of the market already.
Making a game in a way that is legally allowed to make money in china and firing people for speaking out against fascism are completely different though?

Like, Valve was never a super blood-and-guts or ultra-progressive-signalling kind of company. Making a product that passes the Chinese censors doesn't seem like it'd violate their core values or anything. Why not put in the extra 3 hours of effort to verify that they can sell in China?

If they were injecting money **into** the Chinese economy then maybe there'd be some problems, but I don't see anything immoral about taking money from Chinese citizens.
Valve are already working with China for their own version of Counter-Strike as well.

You don't think that lots of companies choose profit over human and environmental well being?
Fascism and Communism are both totalitarian ~~forms of government~~ *economic systems* that are enabled by the false promises of socialism. They aren't polar opposites, they are the same in all but semantics.
Very much so, yep! Claiming they're communist is like saying the Nazis were socialist, Korea's a democracy or the Westboro Baptist Church believe in Jesus - plot-twist, it's basically a hate cult posing as a religion.
Fascism requires more than just "authoritarian right", but they're more similar to it than any other form of government.
Remember Tianneman Square? 

A lot of those protesters were communists

But also no, you are kinda just wrong. You are confusing communist, the socio-economic view/system as envisioned by Karl Marz and early socialist thinkers, with The Communist party, which uses communist language to justify an authoritarian regime. You have to be a member of the CCP to participate in government. 

And yeah, by definition, they are State Capitalist. The state, not the people, own the means of production.

The problems that China had were because Maoism is the idea of "agrarian socialism" and is fairly dismissive of industrialization, as well as the fact it was a centrally planned command economy, not a market one. This is the same problem the Soviet Union had. Command economies are not good at dealing with changes in supply and demand as easily as a market system is, especially over such a large country.

(and no, market economics is not capitalism. capitalism is the private ownership of the means of production, state capitalism is when that is the state)
Communism has a definition which they clearly don‚Äôt meet. Not even a little bit.

‚ÄúNo true Scotsman‚Äù doesn‚Äôt let you dismiss people who are telling you that you don‚Äôt understand the definitions of words.
And the Nazis said they were pursuing a socialist agenda... after they killed all the socialists. 

Newsflash: Evil authoritarian regime lies about its goals in order to retain power.
It does at face value, but it's not.  Companies are not run by the government, they run EXACTLY as companies in capitalist countries do.  The only difference is that the government will force them to comply with whatever it is they're doing to keep their hold on power this week, typically by crushing dissent from the bottom.
Except that you‚Äôre incorrect. Italy under Mussolini was a state capitalist nation and you know who they took as prisoners or killed? Communists and socialists.
Only if you don't actually understand the concept.
Socialism means worker ownership of the means of production. With this in mind, how does authoritarian state capitalism resemble socialism at all?
I never once claimed to be communist, or in support of it. Marx had a valuable analysis of capitalism back in the day, but it's hardly relevant to our society or how modern capitalism operates. Kautsky and Lenin applied that analysis - dictatorship of class - and warped it to create their reformist take on communism - dictatorship of a party - the authoritarian state capitalism that became the USSR. 

So, this isn't me being pro-communist - Tankies killed far too many of us when the tides turned - more...helping to educate those who take things at face value and buy into the western red scare.
I'm not saying I fully agree with Karl Marx (he was a modernist after all and kinda ignored a lot of fine details), but this isn't exactly fair either.

The reason people say "not real communism" or whatever is because in Marxism, the ultimate goal is absent of a state, money, or social classes. Therefore, by definition, the USSR and PRC are not communist (going by marxism). This is largely why they each created their own interpretation and concepts that mimic it, but basically go "yes i like this, but what if i changed it to fit my needs?" 

Its honestly very similar to what the NSDAP and other fascists of the time. They took socialist ideals, such as uniting the working class, anti-capitalist, anti-class distinction, etc, and twisted it into something completely different, typically with a massive dose of nationalism, xenophobia, and anti-semitism. Hell, early NSDAP (as the DAP) advertised itself as "socialism, but without those dirty jews and communists, who are also jews." They also softened their anti-capitalist stuff to again, focus on jews rather than the Bourgeoisie. 

Point is, authoritarians twisting leftist ideology to suit their needs and attain and maintain power is nothing new. Leftist thinking is just really popular with working classes and its kinda hard to start a revolution or get enough votes without a lot of people behind you.

Just cuz someone calls themselves Communist or Socialist doesn't mean they are. Actions speak louder than words.
‚ÄúTrying communism‚Äù is a pretty empty analysis. There are a lot of countries like Burkina Faso and Cuba who have had communist governments that gave a net benefit over capitalism. 

Former colonial countries like China and Vietnam gained strong Marxist-Leninist parties because they advocate for anti-imperialism. No where in the developing world has there been a successful capitalist country because capitalism relies on exploiting the natural resources and labor of other countries. That‚Äôs why China is so powerful today because they opened up to the West in the 70‚Äôs and whored their workers out to American, Taiwanese, European and Japanese businesses.
How did they try communism so hard? They've never tried communism. They had a planned economy that was owned by the state and an authoritarian dictatorship. None of these things are inherently communist except "state owned means of production". However, that state could be Democratic and the economy could be be based on responding to market demands....

The rest of what China does and how it is structured is not communist. They call their party that.. but that doesn't mean that's what they're doing.
How did China strongarm these businesses? Did they threaten them with violence? No, they didn't.

It was the American companies, motivated by the goals of capitalism, that chose profit over people. They could have said " you know what this is wrong, maybe we won't make as much money next quarter but we need to stand with common people and assist them as best we can!"

But they didn't. And they won't. And we all know why. Shareholders need their paychecks.
>do you think North Korea is a Democracy?

Come on dude at least TRY to read what other people are saying.
You‚Äôre leaking dumb apologia on this thread bro you might want to add some critical thinking and actual evidence to that drivel.
So, Blizzard wanted that money?
Your business sounds great, the problem is capitalism will tend to take businesses like yours and have them merge with large conglomerates that don't operate with such community-driven principles, but only profit and often more important share price.
Of course not. It's on a spectrum. I'm not talking about the act of producing a product or performing a service and being compensated in some way. I'm talking specifically about the parasitic elite who use their extreme wealth and power to exploit others and dominate the natural world to it's detriment. It's the system of capitalism that allows them to do that.
Generally, yes. At least from an economic perspective, you want to maintain constant growth as much as possible.

&#x200B;

Basically comes down to two scenarios:

1) If the business is making positive growths, than then everybody who is working for the business would have a greater opportunity for more income. More income for the business can lead to more money for the employee's. 

2)  If the business is not growing, then it is highly likely that nobody is going to be getting any raises anytime soon. 

&#x200B;

Sounds like you could find some room for growth. Put more  money towards investment, delay consumption, or work on innovation. This will help the growth of the business!
At a certain point it is near impossible for people to take mobilized action against a corporation. Comcast, Nestle, Koch industries are all examples of corporations most people can‚Äôt ignore whether out of necessity or ignorance. Capitalism as it stands in a democracy means that it favors the rich in politics, when you‚Äôre running for office in a capitalist nation the richer you are the easier time you have generally. And the richer you are the easier it is for you to lobby. Now you can set the rules of democracy to favor you. Never mind that you can also do it through mass media, after all you are a private company right? It‚Äôs your opinion truth be damned.
I made a pretty small statement that somewhat covers the base. I can elaborate, but my point is that everything inside the "machine" is independently causing it to function. It is modular enough to resolve/replace elements inside of it instead of throwing the whole thing away.
No one has said anything specifically about communism. The solution is democratic socialism, in the manner of northern european countries.
>You ever try to play a board game with someone and they try to be sly and screw you over? Are you just going to throw the whole board game away and say the rules are broken?

I don't think you've really thought this analogy through. A board game is something you play by choice, no one is forcing you and everyone involved usually knows the type of game being played. On top of that the goal of the game is to win, and what winning means is different depending on the game. In a competitive game, like twilight empirium,  you want to get 10 victory points before anyone else, and dicking someone over is a regular part of play. But then you also have Dead of Winter, a game where you and the other players are trying to survive a zombie apocalypse and winter at the same time. This game is cooperative, and everyone wins or loses together. Screwing a player over in this game is a bad idea since success is shared and you'd only be harming the teams chances.

These are just board games though and if I decide at the end of a competitive game that I'm tired of getting screwed over by players who managed to get a better position than me, I might then suggest we play a cooperative game, or we could stop playing games and find another activity. 

Back to real life though where the stakes matter and you can't opt out, capitalism is a competitive system by design. It rewards a handful of people and punishes the rest because, just like in a competitive game where the objective is to win, capitalism's incentives directly push people to aquire more capital. You invest capital, you hopefully get more back. Keep doing that and you are successful, fail and your capital goes to someone else's pocket and they succede. In capitalism in order for some to win, others must lose. Play the game long enough and this divide between initial winners and losers starts to look pretty stratified. It doesn't matter who those people were, or what their values were, they will continue to follow the incentive structure they find themselves in. Replace them with others and the results would be the same.

If that board game had real impacts on my financial well being and I was obligated to play simply by being born, and the sly player who pulled one over on me got to live comfortably with few troubles while I was considerably less comfortable and financially secure, yeah I might want to tear up the rules and get started on some new ones.
Do you really not think that a shareholder centered business model with a single prime directive of constant quarter after quarter growth is not the exact description of our current capitalist economy? Not sure what you think capitalism is then.
Do you agree that companies often, in the pursuit of profit, disregard what's best for human beings?
Ah yes, stop trying to hijack major political and social problems by proposing political and social solutions.
i don't think we need communism. we need something that is more nationalistic than communism. something like national communism, maybe it could be called national socialism
I suggest that common people be in charge of their own lives. I suggest that we no longer allow a select few of ultra wealthy individuals to decide how and when the resources of our planet are distributed. I suggest that workers be the owners of their work places and that they receive the full value of their labor. Is that so radical?
Blizzard made the decision to ban that player. Right? Why did they do that?
I understand your point, I just disagree. You are right that is a less tangible subject. The difference is I believe that is only the case because of, in part, your thinking. 

By your logic we will never end up addressing the root causes of the problem, so they will continue to sprout. Obviously it's important to do damage mitigation in the process (cutting poisonous berries), but at a certain point you need to solve the problem. Because the fact is we can't get to every single one of those plants before the poison berries fall and people get hurt. We can't just keep mitigating. 

And to the overall point that is a problem that I'm shifting the topic: I'm fairly certain the tens of thousands of comments and threads and anger directed towards blizzard specifically will not be harmed by my single point of view. I don't think I'm that powerful.
It was literally a lesser of two evils. Their would have been consequences no matter what they did. What people should actually be concerned about is the fact that they were forced to make a choice in the first place. 

If you were the head of a major company that was suddenly, and through no fault of your own, put in a position where you forced to make a response that would not only involve you in a highly controversial issue/event but also lose you business no matter the decision you made; would you not have reacted in the same manner? 

Lets face it, even if you didn't react the same way, this is a matter of: damned if you do, damned if you don't. At the end of the day, Blizzard is no more responsible for what is going on in China than you or I. And they shouldn't be punished for getting thrown into something they didn't want to be involved in in the first place
They literally have a rule for this kind of thing. Were they not to enforce it and make an example of the player, this kind of thing would just happen again. There is a Chinese proverb:

The nail that sticks out is hammered down.

The player should have remembered it.
Care to make your own comparison?
There is nothing wrong for a young person to have their own opinion, but when they involve others who want nothing to do with it; there will be consequences. The player could have taken their earnings and donated to the cause, but instead, they were foolish. The fault is on them, and they should take the fall. China was given the power by the player himself, when he involved a much bigger power in the situation; and it backfired on him in a big way.
They would have been screwed no matter what they did; and that's the point. They never would have been involved had someone not wrongfully abducted their platform/event for political expression.
Oh yeah? What was Mario's political message? Legalize shrooms?
So you protesting Disney to right? Won't be seeing the new spiderman movie and so on? Throwing out all your marvel stuff and so on. Come on don't stop there. Search every product in your home and throw it out if it says made it china.

Otherwise your a hypocrite

So... Not a single one of those things are actually true. He has not gone after welfare. Has enacted first steps programs for disadvantaged released inmates, and regularly call for spending on American infrastructure instead of endless wars (which he has effectively ended.

As far as breaking the law, well nobody can even state a law he broke, and the transcript of the call that is supposedly a loaded gun completely negates the idea if you actually read it. The only thing he mentioned was that Biden openly bragging about getting a prosecutor fired and blackmailed him with US foreign aid money, which he did do at a council of foreign affairs conference.

He never asked a foreign government to interfere, the investigation was already in existence, but was squashed by the previous administration. The current administration finding out about this and making an inquiry is not only not against the law, it is actually his job and there is plenty of precedent for cooperative corruption investigations running between countries.

And like I said, yay we aren't bombing people for no reason anymore, pretty good for the world when we finally have someone sane enough to say "hey... Maybe we... Stop destabilizing countries"
> Sounds like somebody is trolling lol. You‚Äôre cool with a world leader brazenly breaking the law, asking foreign countries to undermine your democracy and destroying every gov program that did anything for anyone who isn‚Äôt a billionaire? UM. Ok.
> 
> But things are going well for personally eh? Obviously politics in the country are going well!

> Plebeian ....

I wasn't talking to you.  

:)
? You know that she‚Äôs a video game character right
There are
Yes, that's their effect, but not their purpose :)
Blizzard will do anything for that sweet sweet money.

Anything.
So...that's horrifying.
Isn't that customary?

I could see if they said "what are your thoughts on the political climate?" Or something like that.

But if they asked something like "do you have anything to say?" Then they were just doing what they would do for ANY winner.
The man came up to the interviewers in a mask, and he's from Hong Kong. The only way they could stop him from saying it is to cut off the broadcast, which is a job for the producer, not from the shoutcasters who *must* interview him.
Didn‚Äôt one say something to the effect of ‚Äúok say the line and we‚Äôll end the interview‚Äù showing they knew
The former inevitably leads to the latter.
You have to be kidding me here, their longterm plans smack of everything thats communist. Letting their people have money at this point is showing the outside world a face they want you to see. Their beady little hearts are all about brother no. 1 and the red book. When they feel they have the control they want watch what happens, itll make the cultural revolution in the 70s look like day in the park. Why arent we as consumers at this point demanding all companies divest manufacturing from this country. Hong Kong and the muslims genocide should be reason enough not some gaming platform
To be fair, the Shanghai Shitshow was well... a shitshow.
At the very least, Valve goes complete radio silence, instead of actively supporting the Chinese.
> It's the only growth they have since they already own most of the market already.

What do they do when china player base plateaus.

Nm, they gonna go after the current 3rd world slum dwellers.
No one is saying Valve pushing into the Chinese market makes them pro CCP, the poster above you was just pointing out Valve are likely not going to do anything to harm their main window of growth. If Blizzard fires the design team behind Mei in this hypothetical, it means they were probably pressured to do so or felt like if they didn't it would be problematic for them with their Chinese business partners. It's safe to assume Valve would figure the same thing and not risk it by hiring them lol
Wait, is that legal?
I guess we'll see. I sure hope that is true.
Bigsn't
Allegedly he broke some part of his contract? Didn‚Äôt look further into it.

Have you ever considered changing your user name to something more appropriate like "imsimpleminded"?
What you're doing is criticizing a consequence of the issue rather than the real issue. This whole situation would be non-existent if China was just less authoritarian, and if they were less obsessive about political dissent. The overt censorship the government routinely employs is proof of this, and as a result Blizzard either loses something like 50% of WoW players, or they do what they did. You see how it's not Blizzards fault that the Chinese govt. put them in this position? I'll say this, I think what Blizzard did is morally wrong, but when you're considering the livelihood of your business what they did seems correct.
Sure they do. But to fix this particular problem, you don't have to overthrow capitalism. This particular problem can be fixed in a number of less violent ways. Great news, right?
Communism is not a form of government. It is an economic system.

Most governments that have *claimed* to be communist were authoritarian but you could have a democratic, communist country.

Just like you can have a capitalist dictatorship.
If Facism an economic system? I was under the impression is was a method of governance but I'll have to go take a look into that now

Edit: Did a quick google and found that part of a facist government has to do with the way they regulate and restrict the economy. I did not dig deep into this so if anyone wants to correct me or add a clear, concise definition please do so.
That's inane, if a country is capitalist but lies about being socialist in order to gain public support at first, it's no less capitalist.
Fascism is a political system, not an econimic one. The fact that it has economic implications does not limit it to an economic system.
The communism understander has logged on
The "national socialists" who made all industry public weren't socialists? interesting theory...
>And yeah, by definition, they are State Capitalist. The state, not the people, own the means of production.

So *exactly* the no-true-communist fallacy as stated above. It's funny how all the countries that call themselves communist end up going down this route.
Regarding state capitalism being the state owning the means of production versus capitalism being the private ownership of the means of production: what system isn‚Äôt capitalism then?
Market economics cannot exist with public ownership of the ‚Äúmeans of production‚Äù

Private mobilization of resources gives way to a market economy. Public ownership removes that possibility and thus leaves you with a command economy as the only option. 

You were right until the last part where you tried to hand wave away how market economies work.
Probably the most well researched and stated comment regarding the meme that China is communist and tossing out the "no true scottsman fallacy" incorrectly in response to people accurately pointing out that they're not on Reddit.

Also, bravo for detailing how much more nuanced the subject is.
Great write-up. Thank you.

Also, it's crazy that this kind of dialogue is happening in r/Blizzard. Crazy times.
I don't think Italy under Mussolini is a good example of anything except how not to run a country.
Cuba has had a net benefit from communism are you insane? LMAO
>their plans to fully transition over to a communist regime never passes the "dictators take over" phase, so it never actually failed! This glaring issue isn't in any way tied to trying to move to a communist nation!
> Shareholders need their paychecks.

How exactly do you think this works?
> The Communist Party of China maintains that despite the co-existence of private capitalists and entrepreneurs with public and collective enterprise, China is not a capitalist country because the party retains control over the direction of the country, maintaining its course of socialist development.

This is literally the first thing that shows up when you google it.

I‚Äôve written so many essays on this. If a political agent is forcing it to be a certain way, it‚Äôs impossible for it to be capitalistic.
Capitalism is basically let people do what they want with minimal regulation. Yes this leads to abuse, yes it leads to environmental damage, yes this leads to the rich getting richer. and unchecked greed. However, this system is still a thousand times better than having some governmental fucks micromanaging your life under communism or heavy socialism.

Companies get too powerful, greedy, and evil, you stop buying their products and they lose their power. Governments get too powerful and evil you have to start dropping bombs. Which is scarier to you?
Imagine being so insane that you think communism is a good thing. Man that's always what gets me, it's always the entitled people who've never truly known oppression who come around thinking "hey this communism idea is pretty great". Forgetting the millions upon millions of dead and failed governments that have already tried it.
Yeah, they chose not to destroy the lives over all of their employees to make a political statement. I don't agree with the situation but the problem is that the Chinese government has realized total control over the economy through the false promises of socialism which has given them the power to silence any opposition.
What you're arguing is taking private enterprise away from everyone because corporations are shit.
You‚Äôre literally suggesting they be part of the problem
Yea... I mean... it's retail. There's a pretty hard cap on salary, based on the industry standard. Profits wouldn't (and haven't) effect(ed) that.
... that‚Äôs called capitalism, bud. This individual was absolutely talking about communism. Nordic countries use a capitalist system with social safety nets. Reddit truly is a mindboggling place.

‚ÄúRaaaahr fuck capitalism but no wait I don‚Äôt really understand what capitalism is!!‚Äù - you guys

OP literally admitted he was pushing communism. Tankie sympathizers are hilarious. It makes me sad Hong Kong has to try to convince people like you.
The socialist parties in those countries get 10% of the vote. Only Portugal & Spain have democratic socialist governments in Europe. You are misinformed. The US as it is now is not economically very different from Northern Europe, they just have lower taxes on the middle class. Businesses run the same way.
Nobody said that, dude.
Companies harming the environment in the pursuit of profits doesn't mean communism or social democracy do it any better. The only reason that might be the case is because it's harder to pollute as much when you're poor.
No




cringe
Yes, they do. But the problem isn't the system, the tenets of Capitalism don't tell anyone to exploit the less fortunate. Humans are just like that, evil people exist everywhere in every corner of the world.

There are tons and tons of companies in the U.S. run by good people that do good things and treat their employees and customers fairly.
It's not a solution, it's the problem! That's the point.
HAHA right?
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Okay and how does that work? That sounds like absolute chaos. I agree the ultra wealthy class should be eradicated, so there's that. But having common people be in control of their own lives? What does that mean?

And how would a collection of workers owning businesses work? If I started a new business do I automatically have to give away 50% to my first employee? The current incentive for people to innovate, invent things, and create businesses is to gain wealth. If you take that incentive away why would anyone have a new idea or invent something or cure something? The main issue with the current system is that there aren't enough protections for employees.

The point of the CEO is to have a "leader" who makes the ultimate decisions and is held liable for the actions of the company as a whole. But nobody is there regulating how much they pay the workers, that's regulated by the market, and normal people severely undervalue their own time. Unfortunately people can't do much about it because there will always be another person who willingly wants to work for less money than you do. This is why illegal immigration is even an issue in the first place, because it floods the market with dirt cheap labor. This is why we need better protections as employees.

Your ideas sound great on paper, but they fall apart the second you take a closer look. They run on the idea that every human is a good person who has everyone but themselves in mind at all times, and that's simply not how it works.
You're right in that I might seem defeatist after writing my comment. Black boxes can be unraveled with enough efforts. I'm not defeatist but the idea that roots go very deep will always be a bit ominous to me. So I try to unravel the black box at the one end but at the other end at least show my concerns about Blizzard and their most recent PR disaster. 

And btw, your comment I went into so aggressively was one of the most visible comments on the most recent big post on the subreddit. That carries a lot of effect but I might have overreacted a bit though.
They could have simply said, "Blitzchung has violated our professional contract and due to this we are officially warning him and banning him from the next event". 

No one would have had a problem with that, Blitzchung knowingly broke a rule and people understand blizzard had to do something. What people are concerned about is how over the top blizzard went to ensure that China wasn't offended in any way. They made it very obvious that they support their Chinese market rather than free speech and human rights.
That's why it's our duty to protest Blizzard. The alternative is 'damned if you offend China, no consequences for offending the west'. In that world all international companies are only incentivized to appease China. Appeasing the censorship of a dictatorial country is rightfully offensive to the west.  We like our western media to not be controlled by the whims of authoritarian regimes. Sure maybe it's unfair that Blizzard can't appease China and the west, but the west would actually like to see China not having control over global media. The fact that they 'have to make a choice in the first place' is China's fault and we don't have to take that sitting down.
Lol of course it would be a chinese proverb.  Yes Blizzard can choose to make these rules, and of course they can choose to enforce them.  Your original point was that they had no choice.  Of course they had a choice.  And choices have consequences that they are experiencing now
For what?  Why do we need make believe comparisons?  Just look at the actual situation for what it is.  Game company chooses to punish a player and employees for voicing their political opinions, to please their chinese overlords.  Nobody forced them to do anything
Blizzard‚Äôs disciplinary measures inflated the situation and made it an international headline. 

When all is said and done though, Blitzchung knew the consequences of his actions. Another card game company offered to pay him for his lost winnings. His message has been spread further because of the situation.

Its just unforunate to see censorship this extreme in Esports. I grew up hating televised sporting events because players/teams felt like walking billboards with no personality or opinions.  Platforms like YouTube and Twitch have given professional gamers an individual identity among the mass. 

I‚Äôm just sad üòû
Mario is more a metaphorical political message, but you probably don't believe in metaphors anyway. Most old games are the same way.
I haven‚Äôt seen a Disney movie in a while. The marvel movies suck, I‚Äôd never pay to watch them. I‚Äôll admit I probably will have to keep my clothes because it‚Äôs near impossible to find clothes that aren‚Äôt made in China so you got me there.

Just because you‚Äôre too addicted to WoW to quit doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else is. The very least you could do is not flame people for standing up for that because it just makes you as bad as the Chinese government. At a certain point people‚Äôs  lives mean more than a game.

Btw I played on Blameux, would rather delete my account than give my gold to you :)
I honestly can't name the last Spiderman movie I've seen. I've never owned something about Marvel in my life. Anyway, that's besides the point. 

The manufacturer of my light bulbs isn't publicly stating their support for organ-harvesting Commies like your beloved Blizzard is doing.
I'm literally some black dude with blue eyes. But ok.
Emoluments clause?  Heard of it ? It‚Äôs also illegal to ask a foreign government to interfere with our democracy. He‚Äôs lied to the American public in general and has arguably sold out the highest office in America.  He calls for better infrastructure spending ?  That‚Äôs the best you could come up with after his four year term comes to a close?  Sounds like a real hero ...don‚Äôt waste too much time reading this....Fox and friends awaits you ....
Take that statement and apply it directly to original comment lol
There are what?
A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G ^^unzips...
The interviewers is leading Blitzchung to say those eight words which is the ongoing political issue in Hong Kong. If Blitzchung is saying those words on his own accord which is fine, but the interviewers is leading Blitzchung to bring up a political statement which has nothing to today in a video game industry.

I don't think Blitzchung should be banned, however the interviewers should definitely get fired.
At our current level of development, yes. It probably works better once we automate away all the jobs humans don't want to do. And it's not like capitalism doesn't kill millions, it's just less obvious when it does.
I completely agree we should be divesting ourselves from this evil regime. I'm just explaining why this evil should be called fascist, rather than communist.
They moved the world's biggest e-sports tournament to China this year. 2 months ago.

Gaben LOVES the taste of Jinping's boots.
Why is it safe to assume that any corporation would bow down to communist fascism unless they've already pointedly done so? I understand corporations exist to make money, but why is everyone suddenly acting as if one has never hurt their bottom line for a matter of morality, even if it was public facing for maximum PR?
>No one is saying Valve pushing into the Chinese market makes them pro CCP

I sure as fuck am.

If you are outside China, and you want to do business inside china, you **have** to go through the chinese government. That is the way their government demands business in China be done.

And I don't mean you have to pay taxes, I mean you have to do ALL your business through a chinese company, directly controlled by their government.

That means, you are ACTIVELY doing business with a government that is committing a genocide on it's own people and harvesting their organs for profit.
I doubt we see anything. Things will go on as usual. The issue here is that Blizzard acted out in favor of China. Doubt we see this happen much more.
Big if true
Part of the agreement is that anyone on blizzard related reports team cant have *im paraphrasing here* opinions that negatively impact blizzard
It really terrifies me that people as clueless and passionate as you exist.  The casters were fired because they literally told him to do the thing that is explicitly against the terms and rules of the show.  Namely, this: ‚Äúengaging in any act that, in Blizzard‚Äôs sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.‚Äù

As they literally said, right before cutting the stream "say the 8 words and we'll end after."

Honestly I hate that I have to argue with people who don't bother learning the facts and use their emotions to argue, while citing completely irrelevant laws and thinking they know wtf they are talking about.
No
Don't you think there's a problem with an economic system that rewards companies that make decisions that are morally wrong, so long as they stand to make money? There's no law of nature that exists that says blizzard had to do what they did. They did it because they wanted the money.
How can it be fixed? Why haven't we fixed it?

And yes I know. Any attempt to threaten capital power will be met with brutal violence from the ruling class as it always has been.

How could you setup a communist regime without an authoritarian government?

Communism requires absolute commitment from all of it's citizens.

That's why I personally view communism and authoritarianism as two sides of the same coin.

I get that communism has nothing to do with it on its own, but in reality, the two go hand in hand.
That's actually a surprisingly difficult question, but https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5rloof/what_is_fascism_what_beliefs_does_it_entail/ is a good explanation.
The term "socialist" was added as lip service to appeal the party to workers.
They called themselves socialist to appeal to the socialists, then murdered all the socialists.
They didn't make all industry public, and they literally killed all the socialists. 

What the fuck do you think "First they came for the socialists," means?
The Nazis who murdered all the socialists and communists?

"First they came for the socialists" not bringing any bells?

Kinda sad that you have already forgotten the victims of the holocaust.
They didn't make industry public, where the shit did you get that idea?
you're despicable, anyone who defends Nazis should go have a closer look at themselves, troll or not
Funny how no one but fascists say that when one points out Nazis weren't socialists hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Is it really the no true Scotsman fallacy? According to the above commenter it's by definition not communism.
Yes it can. 

If you reallocate all shares of a corporation to the workers or local community or municipiality, it doesn't suddenly mean you end market economics. 

It would just mean some things such as Property cease to be commodified. Not everything in market economy has to be a commodity. I mean, I think we decided that humans are commodities a while ago.

Yes, under communism market economics would not work because there is no money and the unions and communities would theoretically work together to determine what is needed and how and blah blah blah who cares. But there are more systems than just full on communism and capitalism now are there?
There was no research at all. A bit of nuance in that he presented the historic progression of the CCP but his conclusion is faulty because he falsely claims that market economics is distinct from private ownership.
It is a good example of state capitalism because that‚Äôs what it was and as I said they had no idea qualms about killing socialists and communists. If you want a more recent example the military industrial complex is another state capitalist venture since it is government contracts that are exempt from typical regulations and competition of the market.
They have a [higher life expectancy](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-is-us-life-expectancy-so-low) than the US despite being under an economic siege state for over 50 years.

They provide more medical workers the developing world than [all G8 countries combined](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_medical_internationalism). Compared to capitalist countries in the same region like Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Belize that‚Äôs really impressive.
Your question is vague. Mind elaborating on what exactly you're trying to determine?
And?  That‚Äôs still capitalism, regardless of what they say.  That they make demands of companies that otherwise in a capitalist manner doesn‚Äôt make them not capitalist.
If people can control means of production and can acquire and keep self-made wealth, what system IS that?
You‚Äôre confusing [Authoritarianism ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism) with [Communism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism)

Those aren‚Äôt synonymous, despite what American propaganda tells you

China is [Authoritarian Capitalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_capitalism) (well, more [State Capitalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism) really)

Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm a social democrat. Capitalism needs to work for the people rather than just a few.

This is how you read. Also you apparently had a stroke at the end there.
Oh so standing up against China's behavior is now just a "political statement"? Doesn't Blizzards decision affirm and give even more power to China's censorship? I thought you hated that? 

Also, companies can make plenty of money outside of China. You honestly think they'd go bankrupt? The fact is, they can make MORE money in China, so they'll do China's bidding in order to have access to that.
Why should a very small amount of people control the fates of so many others? Is that your ideal society?
No, he's saying the problem is inherent to the machine (capitalism) because even if it seems possible to have a "moral" company when you look at the company level, a finer grain analysis reveals that such a situation is not stable.

Take the nice little happy company that was exampled. It looks nice and a way to solve the moral issues of capitalism, but then you look at it and realize that they will be unable to pay their workers as much as a competitor who **is** aggressively pursuing growth.

I'm not saying that every worker will quit and join the competitor. It's enough for there to merely exist an incentive for the workers to quit.
I'm not sure how you took away that nugget of wisdom from what I said, but alrighty. I was just answering the previous person's comment of them asking if it is a bad thing to not have growth in the company. 

&#x200B;

If you think that this is a part of the problem your probably right. In a sense, we're all a part of the problem :o
Who knows what they were talking about. A they could be a communist shill. Or not. We have to be careful about the assumptions we make online. Perhaps we could be having a productive discussion instead of this one.
Are you sure? Autumn mentioned the shareholder system and constant economic growth, to which you replied "then I guess it's not a capitalism problem" (paraphrased). 

Or did I not read that correctly?

Did you not mean to imply that those were not critical aspects of capitalism?
Right, it's much easier to do when you're wealthy, and that wealth translates into power. Which economic system makes it very easy for people to do that?
Do you understand the science of climate change? Or more plainly, do you believe in climate change caused by human activity?
There are tons of companies headquartered in the US that manufacture or distribute their products from China because they didn‚Äôt care about their workers enough to pay them living wages to the point that they‚Äôd rather pay pennies for foreign labor. The CCP sold out their own labor force to foreign capital in order to build their own manufacturing and to spite the Soviets.
Bruh you think China is communist in 2019? Please read a book
I disagree, I think that any action taken would have been met with a public response; and i'm confident that even if they only merely banned the player, the public would say they were going to far; granted I will give you that I think fewer players would have been as outspoken; but what of the Chinese market? What if Blizzard games were banned in china, and people lost their jobs as a result? At the end of the day, I think Blizzard did the right thing.
Your duty? Seems a bit delusional, but w/e. Have fun; i'm gonna go play overwatch.
My original point was that Blizzard shouldn't have had to make a choice in the first place. None of this would have happened if the player had not wrongly used their game as his vehicle for political expression. For that, he got what he deserved.
Chinese overlords... This guy....

The reason i'm making a comparison is to show you a different perspective. Its easy for you to say that what Blizz did was wrong, having no stake in the company one way or another. Its easy to make broad statements like "Blizz is trying to please their chinese overlords" because thats what the small minded do. Its much more difficult to actually view things from two sides and actually make an informed opinion. 

TL:DR; If Blizz is trying to appease the 'chinese overlord', you're trying to fit in with the sheep.
Despite the fury that comes from debates and arguments; I want you to know that im sad that you are sad. I get where you are coming from; and I understand why you want people who are an inspiration to others to have their own thoughts and opinions. The thing that makes that tricky is the platform that gives them a voice comes under scrutiny when they do. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. In this case, there are many players, many employees, all of which come under fire when the thoughts and opinions of one person influence all.
I don't believe in metaphors? The hell is that supposed to mean?
I'm not addicted to WoW. I enjoy the game lol
Care to link were blizzard say the support that. Because I know you can't lol
[deleted]
Don't watch fox. Didn't just bring up one thing, although one of those things I did bring up (ending endless wars of 20 years) is kinda a big deal and has saved likely hundreds of thousands of lives but yeah, NBD right? And I could bring up a lot more but that's not really the point of the conversation is it? 

Also just saying that he asked a foreign government to interfere with an election repeatedly doesn't make it true. Joe Biden was selling influence and his son Hunter was definitely under investigation by the Ukrainian Government and The Vice President at the time without question used his power and tax payer money to extort the Ukrainian Government to force them to fire that prosecutor and drop the investigation into Burisma. None of these facts are in dispute. The only one is whether Joe was actually selling influence but I defy anyone to come up with a reason why a completely inexperienced person with no background in oil and natural gas who doesn't speak the Ukrainian language who just so happened to be the son of the vice president was the best person for the job outside of influence peddling.

Asking for that to be looked into without the slightest hint of pressure from Trump isn't election interference, it is just common sense. Especially when Joe Biden straight up says this: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UXA--dj2-CY

(addendum: Don't use Google, they bury this simple link to a direct quote and delete the video whenever they find it apparently, I had to repeatedly look it up with direct keywords a few times and mostly got News organizations telling me this never happened but here it is. Foreign interference my ass, Corporate interference seems the most malicious.
What does that mean
People that believe hongkong is not a part of China
He said Hong Kong does not have anything to do with China anymore, how do I supposed to know what he meant lmao
Not my worst fap
> bring up a political statement which has nothing to today in a video game industry.

Except clearly China's attempts to dictate any and all content with threats of financial destruction demonstrates that it is a political statement relevant to today in the video game industry.
>but the interviewers is leading Blitzchung to bring up a political statement which has nothing to today in a video game industry.

Day to day politics ? Sure, probably nothing to do in a video game industry, at least not in a tournament. But we are talking about human rights, here. I would say, any media can be used to fight for your rights and freedom, and the video game industry is one of them.
Can you show me exactly where they did that? Or provide transcripts. Seeing their reaction to what blitzchung said I don't believe you
Nice mental gymnastics
How can you be killed by the ability to own property and do as you wish with it?
They already booked Stockholm for their next. This also was the first TI in China, a country from where 1/3 of TI winners come from, and have a massive playerbase. China doesn't seem like a hill Valve wants to die on, if they can avoid it.
What? First off this is a hypothetical situation I commented on, Blizzard haven't fired anyone related to Mei lol. All I was saying is, if Valve were going to stand in solidarity with the HK protests this wouldn't be their move, they would have announced an indefinite freeze of their servers and services in the Chinese market and issued a statement saying they have no interest in doing business with the Chinese government, which they currently do. 

All I was saying is them wanting to do business in China doesn't inherently make them pro CCP, but being realistic Valve would likely try to avoid getting mixed into this. Radio silence is kinda a classic Valve move
I live in America and pay taxes to the government but I am not a pro-Trump Administration citizen. Valve sought to expand their business, and wanted to reach the Chinese markets. So yes, they had to deal with the Chinese government, and they did. That does not make Valve inherently pro CCP, it at worst makes them pro business over human rights. Not a good thing, sure, but that doesn't mean they support the CCP politics, actions, and gross violations. Not to mention, cancelled relations with the CCP wouldn't really do much except cut Valve's services off from the Chinese population. 

I am not suggesting any of this is okay. In a perfect world yes, Valve would issue a statement condemning the CCP and declaring an indefinite freeze of their business relations in solidarity with the HK protests. They would partner with various development studios for some sort of sale where % of profits go to support groups aiding the HK situation. It would be awesome, and a huge PR boost for Valve, globally. 

But it would also mean unless the entire structure over there changes and foreign businesses become able to do business without going through a governing body, Valve would very likely be forever barred from operating in China, which would be a huge blow. Especially as their competition such as Epic would surely step in and fill the void, actually shaking Valve's iron grip on the PC video game marketplace. Again, it would be awesome if Valve did it, but the reality is you are looking at it in a very black and white lens when it is all a very messy and far less straight forward situation.
a pro player was banned in china because of racial slur. Valve didn't lay a hand on the player but let the org to punish their own player. As mostly valve is hands off on everything as long as they can avoid any.
Voluminous if veracious.

You really should.
The economic system isn't coercing them, how does that even make sense? Instead of dealing with the real problem, you seem to be content chasing ghosts that you'll never catch. Once again, I would like to be clear in saying, had it not been for the authoritarian Chinese government, not only would Blizzard be able to make a morally sound decision, but, THERE WOULDN'T EVEN BE A DECISION. This all started because Blitzchung wanted to speak out about the HK protests and the violence being perpetrated by the government. If China was not so obsessed with absolute control over the citizens, to the point that they are brutalizing citizens en masse, then Blitzchung would've just played, he would've won, done a normal interview, and gone home. The problem starts with China.
Or we pressure Blizzard into reversing their stance on political speech via publicity, boycotts, etc? Good gracious, you just can't see a solution to ANY problem that does not include ending capitalism, can you?
Catalonia in the '30s, the Rojava territories, and the Zapatista controlled territory aren't very authoritarian. At least to my understanding of them.
I try to steer clear of talking in absolutes.

There have been democratic communist governments, not of entire countries but certainly cities.
There have been communist communes that existed free of any larger national control, just not really in the modern era.
>*Capitalism* requires absolute commitment from all of it's citizens.

It doesn't, and nor does communism.
Thank you for that!
[removed]
Ah right, despite me being anti-authoritarian in all its forms I *MUST* be a fascist because I *disagree with you*. The beef I have with communism is that it inevitably leads down the road of totalitarianism. We've done this experiment over and over again, the results always come out the same.
You can't define a movement out of responsibility. If every movement that calls itself communist ends up (when it finally accrues the power to do so) creating a totalitarian system where the government owns the means of production, then that's what communism is *in reality*, rather than what they prefer to define themselves as.
Shares are reallocated to the workers, ok, that‚Äôs just wealth redistribution. Not public ownership. The capital will flow and eventually reconcentrate as workers sell shares to buy houses, cars, pay for kids, etc 

I suppose you could theoretically have a market economy where profit is taxed 100% and redistributed back to everyone. I suspect this would not be a very efficient economy however as productivity would surely suffer with no reward for labor. 

It‚Äôs true that there are more systems than just communism and capitalism. They‚Äôre both ideal economic systems, neither exists in a pure form anywhere. I‚Äôd say China falls more closely under ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù than ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù however because even though there is the impression of a ‚Äúfree market‚Äù it‚Äôs really just a ‚Äústate-sponsored market‚Äù with the dressings of freedom. 

Many of the dominant companies in China are state-sponsored. Even though their share of overall GDP has declined, the effect is such that even the new private companies would still be somewhat beholden to the state as they are competing with state-sponsored companies and their investment money comes from people and organizations with state ties.
Except the US military industrial complex isn't state capitalism. To expand on your example Lockheed Martin still competes with Boeing who still compete with McDonnell Douglas to sell the US government military planes. The state buys from whichever company provides the best bid but the state doesn't own the companies and all of them are subject to competition from each other.
Did I miss the part in your link where they actually provide the life expectancy of Cubans? I'm not seeing in the article or the pdf linked in it. A quick search has Cuba at [78.7 years](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Cuba+life+expectancy&qs=n&form=QBLH&sp=-1&pq=cuba+life+expectancy&sc=5-20&sk=&cvid=74A629DA5D7542C082CA5C2C25D441EF), so would be 0.1 years more than your article's value for Americans. So pretty much no benefit seen

What's more, obesity and healthcare in general in the US is known to be total dogshit compared to many other western nations, so comparing to them is pretty disingenuous, when you have most other locations between 81 and 83 years, per your article's pdf
They're not capitalist tho, they own and indirectly own almost all the major industries in China. That's communism. Additionally, they call themselves communist. 

This is a classic example of "This country makes my political idealogy look bad so it is actually capitalism".

Before it was Venezuela, now it's China
No I'm on mobile and clicked the post button before I was done, I've edited it. You're surely a stable person. Seek help.
A communist dictatorship forces a company to censor its audience and your thought process is "evil capitalists"? Brilliant analysis dude, well done. /golfclap

And I didn't say they would go bankrupt but people would absolutely lose their jobs, Blizzard's leaders have more responsibility to their employees than they do a political movement, even if I agree with said movement.
Right because that's not the end result in every country where communism has been tried and failed miserably?

>You can't define a movement out of responsibility.

The thing is is that that money always goes to the bosses and higher ups and never to the people who are causing the company to grow.
Just slipping back in to the say the business is over 50 years old. Maybe we are an anomaly... but more likely I think people hear about and focus on the excesses of capitalism, rather than the stable workhorses.

You go ahead and have your deep conversation with a communist that only sees the faults in capitalism and not in humanity itself. I‚Äôll go ahead and not waste my time.

Democratic socialism is capitalism, not communism. At least learn your terminology if you want to act like you care about discussing the issue.
Scroll up in the comment chain dude. The structure of capitalism isn't relevant to my point.
I have not done any research into that particular topic and cannot say with certainty whether or not I believe in man-made climate change.
I believe in climate changed caused by China, India, and the majority of South East Asia because they're the ones doing the most damage to the planet by far. I hate this idea that all countries should be held equally accountable when it's very clearly not true.

Think for yourself, BRUH
> I disagree, I think that any action taken would have been met with a public response

Not to this extent though, and that is the point.
Yes it's our duty to tell people in power in the media that we don't want them taking orders from the CCP because if we don't, they have no reason not to and the CCP gets control over all media worldwide. CCP's power lies in the government. In the west we have to rely on the power of the people. If we abandon that we have nothing.
As did Blizzard.
Yeah thats what im doing.  Anyone who has a common opinion is one of the ShEePLe.  If you want to tell yourself they didnt have a choice, you keep defending blizzard with make believe comparisons and keep playing world of warcraft or whatever.  They obviously had a choice. Blizzard chose to side with an oppressive goverment over a gamer's free speech, and theyre experiencing the backlash for it.  Thats literally all there is to it.
Bet.

Mei is a video game character and her lore doesn‚Äôt apply irl. Only what she stands for. ‚ÄúOur world is worth fighting for‚Äù
But their reactions only support this point of view. They knew what he is going to say and hid behind the monitors like idiots. Moreover, they could know it only because they just said "say 8 words"
When resources are distributed so people don't have what they need to live, the ideology at fault is capitalism. Every single American who died as a result of lack of access to healthcare was killed by capitalism. Every American killed by smog or poor air quality because companies would lose profits for cleaning their own messes was killed by capitalism. Every person killed in a conflict sparked by a capitalist country because its corporations wanted some resource in that country (banana republics) was killed by capitalism.

Capitalism doesn't know what externalities are. It doesn't account for damage caused secondarily to the operation of a business, and it is uniquely prone to regulatory capture and corruption of higher government functions. Socialized democracies don't have those problems because a strong central government regulates away capitalist excesses and forces capitalists to care about externalities.
I didn't say it was actually happening, I just don't get why the general idea is that any other company would have bitten the pillow too. We're seeing the opposite with EPIC and etc vocally coming out now, it seems exculpatory to suggest that because it's a region of growth that it would inhibit companies from doing the right thing - especially since we are seeing them literally come out to do the right thing. It's more of a general question to an opinion a lot of people hold instead of a direct expectation for you to explain yourself.
Trying to appeal to Valve's profit margins ain't going anywhere with me. It's not like they're spending the ludicrous amount they make anyway, all they sell is other people's games and hats for games they made 5+ years ago.

If your business requires you to work directly with genocidal dictatorships to stay afloat, your business is bad for humanity, and doesn't deserve defending.
So your argument is that before they ducked their heads to hide and told him to say the 8 words that they would not talk about after and would immediately cut the stream, that they were unaware of what was about to happen, oh ok
Literally in your link -  'Though Blizzard has deleted the stream, a clip of the exchange is being shared online. Moments before Chung speaks, Virtual confirmed to me that he said something along the lines of, "OK, so after you've said your eight words, we'll end our conversation with that. We won't discuss anything more after that. You can start whenever. First, let's bow our heads." '

The only thing he was 'unaware' of was that he was going to be doing the interview in the gas mask and goggles. Once they saw him with that on, they knew what was going to happen and told him to say the words and they would cut the stream. You can be accused of ignorance if you wont even read your own article that you link as a source for your argument.
I‚Äôm not saying they‚Äôre not bending a knee to the central government in China. I‚Äôm saying they shouldn‚Äôt. Clearly they want money more than they care about anything else.
> ‚Äúengaging in any act that, in Blizzard‚Äôs sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.‚Äù
You do realize political affiliation is NOT a protected class, right?  You keep saying "you're not allowed" and that's empirically false, you most certainly are (depending on state).  It's not a federal law.
No.
Yeah and if atoms never condensed into planets and stars we wouldn't be here. You're acting like blizzard had no choice. They made their choice on purpose. Corporations constantly choose profit over people and over morality. 

Why do you refuse to acknowledge that Blizzard has any responsibility for its own decision making?
Sure I can. Just not problems that have pursuit of profit at their core. Why would I not address the root issue?
Only a sith deals in absolutes
You can‚Äôt choose not to interact with capitalism and stay alive in modern America. Capitalism isn‚Äôt voluntary
Just because thats what they called themselves, doesnt make it an accurate term.
Ah yes, just as the Democratic Republic of Korea is a model country for all democracies to follow.
You're wrong.

Not sure what you mean by "nationalized all industry".  Got a source?
I never accused you, calm down. Just pointing out a stupid thing I noticed. Hell, I could expand it to include more groups.

I'm also not a communist and I agree that it so easily turns into an authoritarian nightmare.

I'm just annoyed with the whole "no true communism" thing because it kinda ignores what communism is supposed to be. You cant just call yourself communist and then go and do things that aren't communist.

Yes, it does turn authoritarian. It is at its core a revolutionary ideology that considers anyone who disagrees an enemy and that rarely attracts people who are good at knowing when to stop or goes very well.
This is the best and most concise answer I have heard for the whole "no true communism" argument. This exactly, if every single country that has tried it has ended up the same way, maybe the problem is the system not the people.
Never thought about it like that. However would that mean that communism itself is a totalitarian system or just that it is completely impossible to implement 'true' communism without creating such a system, rendering 'true' communism something that just can't exist?
> Shares are reallocated to the workers, ok, that‚Äôs just wealth redistribution. Not public ownership. The capital will flow and eventually reconcentrate as workers sell shares to buy houses, cars, pay for kids, etc

That is if you commodify it.

Again, market economics does not mean every little thing is a commodity that can be bought or sold. Being a worker means you have ownership. You didn't buy it, you got it by being a worker.

> I suppose you could theoretically have a market economy where profit is taxed 100% and redistributed back to everyone. I suspect this would not be a very efficient economy however as productivity would surely suffer with no reward for labor.

That isn't anything like what I have said. Also did you forget wages exist?

> It‚Äôs true that there are more systems than just communism and capitalism. They‚Äôre both ideal economic systems, neither exists in a pure form anywhere. I‚Äôd say China falls more closely under ‚Äúcommunism‚Äù than ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù however because even though there is the impression of a ‚Äúfree market‚Äù it‚Äôs really just a ‚Äústate-sponsored market‚Äù with the dressings of freedom.

Capitalism != market economics

Nor is communism the lack of it.

Market economics just means that value of goods and services is based on supply and demand for that good or service, not some central authority (such as the state).

And its state capitalism because the state owns the Property and Means of production (though its more of a hybrid now, as they allow private ownership in some regions with state approval).
That just further proves my point, Cuba, a Caribbean island nation that has been subjugated to embargos, sanctions, coup attempts, assassination and [terrorist](https://owlcation.com/humanities/Operation-Northwoods-US-False-Flag-Attacks-to-Invade-Cuba-in-1962) plots by the most powerful government on Earth, STILL can pull off a better healthcare program for itself and export it to poor countries, than the US. 

Compared to their Latin American neighbors they are anywhere between 4-10 years higher in life expectancy. You‚Äôre trying to compare them to countries who are allowed to freely trade with the rest of the world and have guarantees by the US that they won‚Äôt invade them.
You clearly didn‚Äôt read the State Capitalist link and then made bad statements with nothing backing them up.

I guess you would also argue that North Korea is Democratic because the official name of the country is the ‚ÄúDemocratic People‚Äôs Republic of Korea‚Äù

I also suggest you read into the interactions between Venezuela and the US since the 1970s before using them in any argument.
>You can't define a movement out of responsibility. If every movement that calls itself communist ends up (when it finally accrues the power to do so) creating a totalitarian system where the government owns the means of production, then that's what communism is in reality, rather than what they prefer to define themselves as.
You gotta take your own advice before telling others what to do there bruh

Maybe also read a book or two to get those reading comprehension and critical thinking skills up too while you‚Äôre getting help.
How did China force Blizzard? Can you please explain?
This is not always the case. It does happen alot, but that doesn't mean it happens everywhere. People like to focus on the negatives, but they don't talk about the positives as much. A company that gives them amazing benefits or vacation time, like MongoDB or Rubicon, doesn't get as much publicity as the company that is known for poor work conditions (ie. Walmart). 

&#x200B;

There is always the option of starting your own business as well. Not always the first choice for people, but it is an option!
Okay let's break it down further. Sometimes companies pollute the land or water with waste. Even though they're fully aware that it will negatively affect the environment, and the people surrounding it, they do it. 

Why do you think that is?
Facts dont care about your ignorance
"It's totally okay that "western" societies spent the last two hundred years destroying the planet in a race to industrialize, but if anyone else wants to do it, they are specifically bad and evil."

Did I get that right? 

Why do you let some people off the hook just because you happen to live on the same continent has them?
Sadly its not quite as easy to point fingers as that, climate change is (as far as science is convinced) caused by greenhouse gas emissions, and [this graph](https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/images/2019/09/2016%20Country%20Emissions%20Percentages%20GTC02_0.jpg) shows the 2016 (most recent that I could find) data for greenhouse gas emissions per country, the graph was sourced from [this website.](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2.html)

The graph lists the US as the second largest producer of greenhouse gases, with India coming in 3rd.

Even if you go by per capita, (located in the lower portion of the same website) the US is 3rd.

Climate change is a problem as you've said, but the facts indicate that its being caused by China, America, and India in that order. The "Majority of South East Asia" (Here I'm excluding India and China as they're listed above) comes in at under 8%, similar to the US.

Honestly China is the one that needs to change the most, that much is clear, but the US needs to accept it could stand to clean up its act too.
We need to set an example prior to policing them.
1.	It‚Äôs not the case that all movements that self describe as socialist or communist become totalitarian. You just uncritically believe vestigial Cold War propaganda apparently.
2.	China is simply not communist under anybody‚Äôs definition of the word. You could debate about their adherence to communist principles under Mao, but after Deng Xiaoping there is no case whatsoever to be made that China is communist.

Stop talking about things you have precisely zero understanding of and do some reading.
There are so many sides to look at this though. Maybe they could have dealt a lighter sentence, but that raises other questions:

- Would a lighter sentence deter future pro players from doing the same?
- Would a lighter sentence have garnered a different reaction from other markets (obviously) most notably the Chinese market?

At the end of the day they made an example of this guy so this thing wouldn't happen again on their platform, or during related events. Americans are opinionated, but very lazy, its doubtful that the negative press they are receiving now will matter in the long run. That was likely their primary motivating factor for making the decision they made.
I believe in capitalism, so yes, if you don't want to purchase blizzard products because of some misguided ideology, hey; more power to you.

But I think this is much bigger than that. This is a bunch of virtue signaling SJW's band-wagon'ing and witch hunting a company in order to feel more holier than thou art.
Where does blizzard say they support it. Not blizzard protecting their product.

> Every single American who died as a result of lack of access to healthcare was killed by capitalism.

No, they were killed by whatever condition they had.  Healthcare in America is extremely regulated and heavily subsidized, and when that centrally-planned system fails, you go around and blame capitalism?

>Every American killed by smog or poor air quality because companies would lose profits for cleaning their own messes was killed by capitalism.

Collectively-owned factories don‚Äôt pollute? TIL

> Every person killed in a conflict sparked by a capitalist country because its corporations wanted some resource in that country (banana republics) was killed by capitalism.

And here is where you lost me? How are actions of the State, the sole largest violator of private property, in any way shape or form ‚Äúcapitalism‚Äù? The government sustains itself through violence and theft, not voluntary transactions respecting private property. And any collectivization of the means of production will only give these bastards MORE power,  not less.

> Capitalism doesn't know what externalities are.

Only people can know things.

> it is uniquely prone to regulatory capture

Are you arguing that regulations of the market are a bad thing? Congratulations, you are a capitalist. Or are you iust arguing against democracy?

> Socialized democracies don't have those problems because a strong central government regulates away capitalist excesses and forces capitalists to care about externalities.

If laws exist that affect the economy, it becomes a viable strategy to pay regulators to enact them in a way so as to stop your competitors. If you can‚Äôt invest resources to do that, you are forced to just make better products instead. But as long as there is democracy, campaigns will need to be financed and companies WILL find a way to meddle.

What is a socialized democracy anyway? Socialism is the collective ownership of the means of production. That can only be attained through violence and slavery, so you don‚Äôt really have ANY examples of a socialist country that is a democracy. You don‚Äôt mean the nordic countries, do you? Cause they are [NOT socialist](https://www.google.com.br/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2018/07/08/sorry-bernie-bros-but-nordic-countries-are-not-socialist/amp/). Also, being heavily regulated will make an area good, huh? Ask the American Healthcare system.
Well I was specifically commenting on Valve due to their situation. This thread was started because someone made a joke about how Valve would hire people Blizzard fires in relation to this, and someone replied suggesting they would probable cave just like Blizzard is, which was then contested. 

Valve specifically have a *lot* of investments into the Chinese market now, mostly in relation to Perfect World a Chinese company. Valve has sunk a ton of time and money into expanding into China, same with Blizzard, so it makes sense from a business standpoint that these companies wouldn't want to rock the bed so to speak. Blizzard more so, with direct ownership ties to Tencent. But Valve would certainly not try to stand out in solidarity with the protests unless they were sure it would not harm their business ventures in China. 

Epic on the other hand doesn't have nearly as much invested in China. Valve sort of muscled them out in a way, so it makes sense they feel free to stand out against the CCP as they have far less to lose. Sometimes a company will act on the side of morality even if it means a blow to their business. All I was commenting on is that Valve is very likely not one of those companies, at least not in this situation.
Valve already banned a player from attending a dota major in China, because the government of the city it was held in didn't want him there.

Granted the player most likely wouldn't have even been given a visa.
Lol okay. I really don't think there's anything left to be said here. You are reading my words in your own voice and misconstruing what I say.

I said very very clearly the fact that Valve does business with the CCP and is not cutting it off in light of the HK protests is not okay. I am simply explaining to you why it makes sense from a critical standpoint. 

I can understand perfectly why someone does something even if I disagree with it wholeheartedly. And I don't think anyone has tried defending Valve or any company for that matter who have acted, or rather not acted, during all of this. 

Also to be clear Valve in no way needs the China market to stay afloat lmfao. They are simply expanding there for the sake of continuous growth and to avoid stagnation as they already dominate the western markets. **Again, I am not defending it, I am simply explaining it.**
I think you should take advice from your own Username bud
Thank you for this lovely false dichotomy, strawman argument. 

While it would be nice to believe that Valve could just ignore China, they have to respond to China's heavy investment in the industry, including significant investment into the Epic launcher, which is the first real competition Steam has had since its inception. The current market presence will only insulate them and keep them afloat so long if their direct competition has an extra billion potential customers. Either they comply with the requirements to sell in China, or they eventually lose money. There might be ways around it, if you look hard enough, but that requires lots of other things to work out ok. No matter how big they look, there is only so much they can take and stay afloat

Then let's see how much a bunch of Republicans bitch when they get fired.
More demonstration of your emanant cleverness?
Way to strawman my argument instead of acknowledging any of the various truths i stated about China. You seem to be so against Blizzards choice of profit over human rights, but what about China? They don't even choose profit, they choose power over human rights. Fundamentally worse because they're trying to control the people directly rather than the peoples money, do you get it? Censorship on the scale that China perpetrates it is no longer what i would consider censorship. It's thought policing. 

Why do you refuse to acknowledge that China is the perpetrator of one of the largest humanitarian crises in recent history. I mean come on, they're hiring triad gangs in HK to attack the protesters, this is actual evil you're defending just so you can take a stab at capitalism, but it isn't even remotely justified.
The profit motive isn't necessarily bad. It's a powerful motive. We just need to make sure that we reign it in, for example when it's used to silence political speech.

If we lived in an older house, and every time there was a problem with the plumbing or something, you suggest fixing the problem and I suggest tearing down the entire house and starting over, who would have the more reasonable response in that situation?
"Interacting" and "absolute commitment" are not the same.

I interact with capitalism but I'm not remotely committed to it.
> You cant just call yourself communist and then go and do things that aren't communist.

I would agree, considering a similar thing happens with the word "liberal" and I can go into great detail as to how that term is being misused. But unlike communism liberalism has a long history of proper use, whereas communism always seems to turn to authoritarianism as soon as it acquires the power to do so.

Edit: I would liken it to "dictator", it didn't originally have the negative connotations it does now, it's the history of the abuse of the position that put those connotations there.
"True" communism can exist (after a fashion) on very small scales (small enough that the majority of people know the majority of other people). It is the inherent anonymity that comes with large populations that causes communism to crumble (people are less willing to work for the benefit of people they don't know, and those who cheat the system are more likely to get away with it).

The only method yet devised to compensate for this is a central authoritarian government, without which the system collapses.
>That isn't anything like what I have said. Also did you forget wages exist?

I was trying to come up with something like what you were imagining: a market economy with "means of production" owned by the public

Yes, I know of wages. That is exactly what is mentioned in what you quoted from me. A wage, distributed via profit taxation from the state. This would allow for private enterprise to run, but all profit would be redistributed. This is effectively a market economy, but public owned "means of production".

>That is if you commodify it.
>Again, market economics does not mean every little thing is a commodity that can be bought or sold. Being a worker means you have ownership. You didn't buy it, you got it by being a worker.

Now you're just using words with no substance. "Commodify"? It's a share of a company. It has value. That is the only reason it exists, is as proxy for value of a company. If you can't sell a share, it is literally a meaningless proposition. If workers receive "shares" for working, they better be able to sell them or you're giving them a useless piece of paper. "Shares" don't entitle you to profits through ownership, but through speculative appreciation in the value of the company.

>Nor is communism the lack of it.
>Market economics just means that value of goods and services is based on supply and demand for that good or service, not some central authority (such as the state).

>communism
>not based on central authority (such as the state)

Communism is **defined** by central authority. "Public ownership" is tantamount to "state ownership".
You are truly brainwashed if you think that Cuba is providing more medical services to 3rd world countries than the US, there may be a  larger # of private citizens involved but being from Cuba and working in the medical industry in another country is nowhere in the same ballpark as the medical relief that the US provides free of charge to other countries.
Okay so they are state capitalist in terms of their economy, but more communist in their "social scores", dictatorship, censorship etc.


With venezuela, their relatively thriving economy very quickly went to shit after electing their socialist dictator. Are you really going to blame the US? Can you be a more stereotypical "fuck america, communism is actually not that bad" lefty.
Unironically condemns capitalism and defends communism, accuses another person of being poorly educated.

Man I'll give you this, haven't laughed this hard in a while. Now go tell mommy you need the newest iPhone and 30 bucks to go to Starbucks while you stick it to us capitalist swine.
In the only way that a government can with a foreign company, disallow them to operate in their market.

Doesn't matter, you're not going to win with this line of logic because the only institution with the power to coerce the other is the COMMUNIST CHINESE PARTY you CANNOT spin this to be the fault of capitalism.
Dude, they're a T_D user.

What you're doing is like trying to talk to a deaf person over the phone.
This is what regulations are supposed to be for. Unfortunately, nothing is perfect and it takes time (and usually public outcry following an event that brings it to attention, which is then followed by extensive studies to conclusively prove the problem needs regulating) to recognize problems in need of regulation and then to implement said regulations.
Nobody is being let off the hook but when those areas he named are creating 75% of the pollution and you look at a country that is creating 5% and tell them they are the main source of the problem, you look like an idiot.
Well considering we can't change the past two hundred years without a time machine, why should we dwell on it instead of trying to change the present and the future? Maybe you need to work on your obsession with the past and focus more on who's doing what *today.*
China is actually one of the countries that put the most effort into reducing their emissions. Especially in the big cities where they heavily limit people's ability to drive cars. They rank as the 12th largest emitter by capita (when only counting the 20 most emitting countries) (3 times lower than the US, Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia) despite being the manufacturing capital of the world and their emission rates are constantly dropping since 2013.

They only rank that high because of their insanely large population and manufacturing industry. In particular the emissions caused by manufacturing should be spread across all countries importing goods from them, because if they weren't manufactured in China, they would still be manufactured. Just somewhere else.
> At the end of the day they made an example of this guy so this thing wouldn't happen again on their platform, or during related events.

Yes, and in doing so they have basically made a political statement.
This doesn't have anything to do with social justice or left-right ideology. It's about westerners not wanting western media companies to be controlled by the CCP.
Right, your IQ is probably not enough to read properly, my apologies.
"Meanwhile, we will, as always, be determined to defend the pride of the country (China)". Y'know. The same country governed by, ah, say, a communist regime who made organ harvesting legal.
Translation:

"My translation: *we would like to* ***express our ‚Äòstrong anger and condemnation‚Äô*** *at what happened at the Hearthstone Asia Tournament last weekend. We also* ***strongly object to the spreading of personal political beliefs*** *during any contests. The c****ontestant involved (Blitzchung) will be banned*** *from participating in any contests, and the* ***broadcasters involved will also be immediately stopped from working*** *(under Blizzard). Meanwhile, we will, as always, be determined to* ***defend the pride of the country (China)****.*"
You are confusing me. Do you support china? Lol Blizzard bad disney ok lol. Seriously lol
Communism is the collective ownership of the means of production. Socialism is varying degrees of government provision of goods and services. American healthcare outcomes are demonstrably the worst in the developed world in every category except 5-year survival for a few types of cancer, while also being 40% more expensive per person per year than Norway's. Every other developed country in the world has some kind of mass taxpayer-funded healthcare system which covers every citizen, even more heavily regulated private insurance than the US, or both. Locally collectively owned factories don't pollute as much because the stakeholders care about the area being polluted. Because they live there.

Capitalism, by concentrating capital with a small group of people, also concentrates power with that group. The means of production ARE the power of the state, as the state cannot exist without systems to provide goods and services. The people who hold the means of production therefore hold the power of the state. Therefore, in capitalist countries, the actions of the state are the actions of the capitalists. In social democracies, like those which exist over all of Western Europe, the power of the capitalist is tempered through taxation and the legally-enshrined right of the worker to unionize without fear of corporate retribution. This allows the economy to grow while also making sure the rest of society benefits from that growth.

You're right that the state can, and often does, use its tools to oppress and subdue. What you're wrong about is why it does so. The state cannot exist without an economic system to back it. Therefore, the state is dependent upon the economy it exists in. If the economic system it exists in is oppressive and concentrates wealth and power with very few, the state will do so as well. If it does not, it will not.

That is ultimately what happened every time communism has been tried. Not only is communism impossible at our current level of development, it is also impossible in anything less than a hyperindustrial economy. If the means of production do not exist to be siezed, the proletariat cannot sieze them. The revolutions of the 20th century were peasant revolts, and they went about as well. No matter the pretty words charismatic madmen said to bring the peasants under their banner, words don't uplift a nation.
Tencent owns 40% of Epic, but mostly I agree. I should have made a top level comment instead of responding to you, since it was a pretty general thing I was bringing up in response to something very focused.
And I'm explaining to you, that Valve's profit margins can fuck right off in the face human rights.

I understand how cancer works. Does that mean I go into every thread about cancer, and explain how cancer works to people who say "I lost my brother to cancer"? Of fucking course not.

Because *why* it killed them isn't relevant to this issue at hand. The issue is *that* it killed them.

Why Valve kisses the Chinese government's ass isn't the issue, the issue is that they're doing it at all.

And your 3 paragraph "explanation" could have been replaced with a 4 words: "Valve wants chinese money."
Thanks for letting me know you're incapable of saying anything of value.
> Either they comply with the requirements to sell in China, or they eventually lose money.

Fine.

If your business model requires you to do business with a genocidal government, your business should not exist.
I don't know what to tell you, other than that there are probably better ways to get information than to just read articles.  

Generally, I find checking the comments of Reddit helpful, and actually reading/skimming top to bottom to find the translation that you "couldn't understand", and then follow up on them.

Maybe it's an age difference, but knowing how to ask the right questions and find information is a really important skill in this day and age.  I also can't understand the language of the stream, that doesn't mean it's acceptable for me to not try to determine what was said, or why a company may have acted in a way that I would imagine is obviously wrong.

I'm sorry, but you can't make up your own reasons, and claim they are true, without evidence other than "well, it COULD be true.  That's stupid.  Very stupid.

> ‚Äúengaging in any act that, in Blizzard‚Äôs sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.‚Äù

Read that again, then ask yourself, did the player commit that offense?  Did the casters assist the player and allow him to commit the offense by saying: 

"Casters: ok so if you just say the 8 words we'll stop here, enough chit Chatting for now.  Don't forget to put your head down"
Yuh
I literally agree with every criticism against China that you laid out. When did I ever say anything to the contrary? Why would you assume I support any of that? 

The topic at hand is Blizzard's decision to do what they did. You said I'm "criticizing the consequence of the issue". That's wrong. Blizzards decision is the issue we are talking about. Or at least the one I've been attempting to discuss this entire time. Blizzard made a decision. Influenced by number of factors, sure. 

What I'm asking is, why did blizzard do that? China is doing bad things. I agree. So why did blizzard do what they did?
Bad analogy. The fact is, as long as capital can be accumulated and horded, and as long as that capital correlates to power, we'll never be free of the tyranny of the few ruling the many.
well, you'll be kicked out of your house and starve if you don't, so...
Very interesting and convincing points, thanks for engaging me. What did you mean by "you can't define a movement out of responsibility"?
> Now you're just using words with no substance. "Commodify"? It's a share of a company. It has value. That is the only reason it exists, is as proxy for value of a company. If you can't sell a share, it is literally a meaningless proposition.

People who own shares have voting power and are owed dividends. Its not "meaningless".

> If workers receive "shares" for working, they better be able to sell them or you're giving them a useless piece of paper.

They aren't paid in shares, they just have them. Much like how you can't sell your citizenship. You just have it when you are born in America. You can give it up if you want to be a citizen of another country, sure, but you can't sell it. And yet, despite not having a monetary value, it still has other value to having it. It allows you to work anywhere in the 50 states, it allows you to vote in national and state elections, and you get to freely use the roads, have the rights, privileges, and entitlements. But by your statement, the fact you can't sell it to someone else makes it "meaningless".

> "Shares" don't entitle you to profits through ownership, but through speculative appreciation in the value of the company.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend

> Communism is defined by central authority. "Public ownership" is tantamount to "state ownership".

Except, not? Have you literally not read ANYthing on communism?

And just, no, public ownership does not mean state ownership. Did you never hear about, idk, *anarchy*?
Free of charge is a good one. They should remember that when a US trained soldier fires live ammo at their next protest.

No shit that the Caribbean island country that‚Äôs been embargoed for half a century can‚Äôt compare technology wise to the world‚Äôs largest economic and military power.
You‚Äôre attributing Authoritarianism to Communism again. Both already have well established theoretical definitions and you saying one thing is ‚Äúcommunist‚Äù does not make it so. 

Read up on [US-Venezuela relations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States%E2%80%93Venezuela_relations) it went to shit after Madduro was democratically elected because he was socialist. Given [the extensive history of US backed regime change is South America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change_in_Latin_America) it‚Äôs basically guaranteed that the US had a direct role in the problems in Venezuela that lead to the contemporary authoritarian (!) regime (which is indefensible). 

So the US did what China is doing to US companies but worse to Venezuela, because Venezuela had the audacity to elect a dissident to US influence in the region.

The problem here is people using Venezuela in an argument without any of the historical reasons for why it‚Äôs lead to this authoritarian regime. It‚Äôs disingenuous.
You gotta start reading those books dude. Your errant inferences of my motivations just demonstrate your poor reading comprehension skills. 

Gotta level it past 1 bruh.
But why would a company do something bad for money? Are you okay with that? Are you okay with us corporations being used as tools for authoritarian governments?
I've got time to kill.
And then those regulations are disregarded or destroyed by the next administration. Capitalism is a destructive machine, and we can't just put foam covers over the blades.
You know who those countries export to? The United States, the largest consumers on the planet. They run their businesses based on the luxurious wants of the American people, maybe if you stopped purchasing products made in China, or India they wouldn‚Äôt be polluting so hard. But wait! That means boycotting nearly every corporation in America that‚Äôs impossible to do! Wow it‚Äôs almost as if capitalism has high jacked democracy for the ultra rich.
The US is 2nd in the world for CO2 emissions
Most of the companies causing that pollution are headquartered and incorporated in the US and Europe. If those countries tried to stop them from polluting, they‚Äôd be sanctioned, smeared as needing a regime change, then would be subjected to a US backed Civil War or decades of crippling sanctions.

You mentioned accountability. So you're saying that no one should ever be held accountable for what they did in the past? Why is that?
They basically didn't have a choice. The situation demanded a response, so they responded.
But Blizzard isn't really a western company; maybe it was at one point; but given that it operates in many markets the world over, it is no longer a western company. It is a global company, and sometimes its difficult to appease everyone; something they wouldn't have had to do had the player in question, abided by the rules.
Anyone who brings up IQ isn't very smart...
That's blizzard saying keep politics out of our game. Not we support murder. So if I support american country's I'm supporting breeding terrorism by that logic lol
Yeah, I‚Äôm out. No point arguing with someone who didn‚Äôt even bother to google what Socialism means.

> 1 : any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods
>2a : a system of society or group living in which there is no private property
b : a system or condition of society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the state
>3 : a stage of society in Marxist theory transitional between capitalism and communism and distinguished by unequal distribution of goods and pay according to work done

Socialism IS the collective ownership of the means of production. It is NOT capitalism + welfare state, or regulated capitalism, or any of that nonsense. Capitalism is the recognition of private property, socialism is its abolition (inevitably by force).

Communism, on the other hand, is the utopic end result of Socialism, when the State is no longer necessary as a manager of the means of production, and society is classless, stateless and moneyless.

Also, you downvoting me before even responding is pathetic and petty.

Good day.
I think the difference between the 5% of Blizzard owned by Tencent and the 40% of Epic is the value of those stocks. 

Epic exploded without the Chinese market, and losing it means pretty little to them. Not to mention their main element of business over there is in licensing out Unreal Engine, which afaik is something Chinese businesses need licenses for, not the other way around, so all the CCP could do in retaliation is bar those companies from doing that, which really only harms their own economy because most of Epic's profits currently are on the heels of Fortnite and the Epic Store developer contracts.

In contrast, Blizzard really struggled in the Western Market with WoW for a long time and it was the access to the Chinese Market through Tencent that gave them an insane boost, so while the 5% stake is less than the 40% of Epic, neither are majorities so end of the day it's about the pressure that can be applied. Blizzard losing the China markets is far worse for them than Epic losing it.

Also yea, I gotcha haha. I like discussing this stuff tho :p so ima keep replying to you anyways
You are very caught up in this lol, it's a hypothetical. Valve have not done anything to kiss the CCP's ass, they just having done anything to declare against it. It's an important distinction. It is still the wrong choice in the question of morality, but it's not in the same vein as Blizzard actively punishing people even just in the same interview as someone who speaks out against the CCP.
Hey, I am just pointing out your own advice. You're upset about a hypothetical situation involving a company that has nothing to do with the company that actually did this.
Ok. Then Epic wins, and majority of our gaming is controlled by China, instead of just a small portion of it. That's a nice idealistic opinion, but the consequences are worse, not better. Unless you can convince the US or EU government that the people can take the economy hit that banning Chinese corporations from operating or investing in companies (which we really should do until China provides reciprocity in allowing buisness) that approach just allows the Chinese governments effectively infinity money to automatically win.
Ahh, a refreshing voice of reason. Few and far between on reddit. Have an upvote.
The casters didn‚Äôt directly say anything unless you speak Taiwanese and would like to translate.
Edit:

The US based articles I‚Äôve been reading make it out that Blizzard terminated their employment.
I didn't realize that *international politics* and the interests of a *hostile foreign power* as declared by the idiot in the Oval Office were included.

 Well I've already established that I'm not defending them. I think they are morally in the wrong, however I disagree with the suggestion that they're immoral because of Capitalism. They're immoral because they're human, and humans have greed. It's the same reason Communism has failed historically multiple times. Once the "Provisional Leader" is appointed, the greed of the individual takes over and the final stages never come to fruition. I think that the people behind the decisions at Blizzard are blinded by the Chinese Governments Wallet. Their options are either to lose a HUGE amount of revenue, and subsequently have all of their products banned in China, or they can do what they did. I DO NOT agree with what they did, however, greed is a powerful thing and I do not think greed is exclusive to Capitalism.
It's only a bad analogy if you think capitalism is a worse system than the alternatives. Most people disagree.
Just that. Just because a movement defines itself as [feel-good rhetoric] doesn't mean you get to ignore it when more often than not members of said group do exactly the opposite. 


This is doubly the case where motte and bailey tactics are used in defense of an ideology. For example, where the offenders are usually defended (bailey) by those who claim to be defenders of [feel-good rhetoric] until the actual topic of the inconsistency comes up, upon which they are rejected (motte) only until the topic is dropped again (return to bailey).
Dividends are not an obligation. Most companies you might invest in today do NOT pay a dividend. 

I‚Äôll grant you that they give voting power, so maybe the workers would ‚Äúelect‚Äù the leaders of their company? That could prove good, I‚Äôll give you that. 

Anarchy is like the opposite of communism, or any system really. It is the absence of rule. Public ownership cannot exist in an anarchic society. It would be null ownership.
> Free of charge is a good one. They should remember that when a US trained soldier fires live ammo at their next protest.

great gravy that was completely unintelligible garbage, what a weak ass cheap shot lmao
So you're finally admitting that communism's false promises are the tool that enabled the authoritarian government to exist in China?
If the next administration is able to destroy regulations of importance, it is a failure of democracy, not capitalism.
You were so close to having a coherent thought!
Why are you more concerned with accountability for things we can't change than accountability for what's going on right now?
> Game Studios make games, not political statements.

They were forced to respond. They were not forced with the severity of their response. They made their choice to respond harshly to what was said, and in doing so, made a political statement.
Meanwhile, we will, as always, be determined to* ***defend the pride of the country (China)****.*


This doesn't mean "keep politics out of our game". You wrong.
Valve fired a caster, in the middle of a dota 2 tournament, at the chinese's request, 2 years ago.

They're literally the pioneers of that behavior.
Do you really not understand that Epic, Valve, Riot and all these companies doing business with genocidal governments, need to fix their shit or die?

Go away until you understand what principles are.
Thanks man.  Researching is hard work, I literally had to type my exact question in Google and not click the Ads that popped up.  Then I had to read shit :(
>The casters didn‚Äôt directly say anything unless you speak Taiwanese and would like to translate.

Lol holy shit your logic is killing me dude.  "The caster's didn't say anything!!  I mean, unless you speak Taiwanese... then I suppose they could have said something.... but I don't speak Taiwanese, so I'll just fucking assume that literally nothing of value or context could possibly be said.  I mean, who the fuck speaks Taiwanese?  Irrelevant, they must have said nothing because I didn't read anything about it and I don't know how to check the most highly upvoted thread about it from a few days ago and check the literally top comment."
"If it would have been a completely different situation, the outcome would have been different too."

Get this man a fucking Nobel Prize for his astonishing discovery.  Bravo, lad.  Bravo.  It's almost like... the severity of the action determined the consequence.  Weiiiird.  I mean, it's not like we can look to another incident like the NBA drama and figure out that pro-HK comments/statements cause potentially millions of dollars of damages and controversy from pro-China customers.  No wayyyyyyyyyyyy
Exclusive? No. But greed is absolutely encouraged and fostered and rewarded under capitalism. It sounds like you've never really read much about the rise and fall of communist societies outside of generalities and memes. I don't mean that as a dig, we live in a capitalist society so obviously that information isn't in the forefront of everyday life. 

But the simple fact is that when profit is threatened by morality, capitalism by design will choose profit. Thanks for the conversation but I'm done with this thread.

China‚Äôs has had authoritarian governments since the Han dynasty. The CCP is authoritarian because they originated as a gu√©rilla army fighting against the dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek and Imperial Japan. After they won they were perpetually were at risk of being invaded by the US and never completely demobilized.
Oh so you don't think that private interests and multibillion-dollar corporations have any influence on politics?
This would have been a response no matter what they did. People just need a cause to bitch about

LMAO yeah it's all the evil US's fault that China is a dictatorship rofl keep drinking that koolaide buddy
First, yes, some people complain no matter what. That doesn't take away from people making valid complaints  about a company's actions.

Also, that isnt relevant to the point you were making. Companies shouldn't be making political statements. Blizzard has, and is facing the justified consequences.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism

> even if the public itself is the authority.

Yes, that is anarchism.

Have you not heard of it before?
It‚Äôs not entirely the US‚Äôs fault but it definitely isn‚Äôt helping every time their politicians scream ‚Äúregime change‚Äù start a war that kills and displaces millions of people, set up a dictatorship loyal to them then complain that the people there don‚Äôt like you. Yeah it makes some countries a little militaristic so that they can avoid turning into Iraq or Guatemala.

A powerful photo. This snowball will be bigger and bigger for blizzcon.
Honestly could be a neat card idea (and 'thematic' as well). I've seen the version with mass Silence and add 5 coins to your hand. I forgot how much it cost, but it could enable crazy one-turn plays
sounds like someone doesn't want their game banned in china. might cost them a lot of money
The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: ÂÖ≠Âõõ‰∫ã‰ª∂, li√πs√¨ sh√¨ji√†n), were student-led demonstrations in Beijing (the capital of the People's Republic of China) for the establishment of basic human and press rights and against the Communist-led Chinese government in mid-1989. More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: ÂÖ´‰πùÊ∞ëËøê, bƒÅji«î m√≠ny√πn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.

Sounds legit badass tbh
what really sucks about all this is that almost non of the Chinese people, the ones that can do something about this will not see any of it.
There really aughta be a timer posted for how long it's been that only stops when blizzard reverses it all, apologizes, AND takes the side of the protesters.
 \#FreeHongKong
Lol. Americans making fun of the Chinese government for being corrupt.
I dunno. Seems like power creep. For 4 mana you get the silence all minions so we have to debate prize money vs draw a card. Obviously prize money is worth 6 mana and a card is worth 1.5 so this should be a 10 mana card.
Make the last sentence ‚ÄûAdd one coin for each silenced minion to you hand‚Äú and we have a valid card.
Wait, /r/Blizzard is open? Bold move.
It has to be zero mana, basically effortless

Best kek I've seen in months
Love it. People are only pointing at Hong Kong and not realizing this is still the same government that has killed literally tens of millions of its own citizens with everything from mass starvation to running them over with tanks. The only thing that changed is the faces in government. Any company that bows to Maoist China supports a complete lack of human rights in a pattern that has existed for decades.

as a hongkonger, i'd just like to say a big thank you to all of you, especially the poster.

What a value at only 8 mana. Broken card Blizz plz fix.

Oh geez, it‚Äôs epic?! I thought it was a common card...
Storm BlizzCon 2019, They Can‚Äôt Stop All Of Us
This should be a common card, not epic.
I have enough karma, I can spare some of it with the downvotes I'll get.

***I 100% agree with HK and am pretty anti-China in general***, but Blizz was well within their bounds to do this. They booted the Hearthstone player because he made political statements during a grandmaster tournament interview. One of the code of conduct TOS that all the grandmasters have to abide by is basically "no political statements during the tourney".

As reddit was quick to remind us when YouTube started deplatforming people, "Companies aren't subject to 1st amendment laws". They don't want their tournament streams to turn into post-match megaphones for whatever cause the player wants to champion. Would you guys care if they banned someone for putting on a MAGA hat and saying "TRUMP 2020!" during a post match interview?

And this drama proves that they were right to have that rule in place, because none of this would be happening if people had adhered to the rules. The player could have said all of those things at pretty much any other place or time and would have no punishments from Blizzard at all, but he chose to deliberately break the terms of the agreement he had with Blizzard. 

I don't know about you, but I don't want my Twitch hearthstone tourneys to turn into post match "Vote Bernie!" "Ban China!!" "Fuck Trump!" "Boycot Nestl√©!" or whatever else megaphone. There are plenty of other places that you can champion your cause(s), you don't need to hold private companies hostage so you can use their platform as your platform.

In Hong Kong, gamers are deleting the games and account. not only that, but also asking to take back their personal data for their own safety. this should add more work to their admins. according to EU law, if the data isn't processed within 30 days, Blizzard is liable for a heavy penalty too.

You're using Reddit, so it's -1000 for you!
No one is arguing that Blizzard isn't within it's rights to do this. They absolutely are.

However, due to freedom of speech, we have every right to call them out on this. And why shouldn't we if we all support the cause?

> I don't want my Twitch hearthstone tourneys to turn into post match "Vote Bernie!" "Ban China!!" "Fuck Trump!" "Boycot Nestl√©!" or whatever else megaphone.

Please don't try to equate this to regular politics. You do realise China is more or less Nazi Germany right now and that HK is fighting for it's rights? Don't make this seem like someone is just throwing out a random political opinion, this is a moral issue that people around the world are standing up for. 

Saying that voicing support for HK is equal to "vote Bernie" is dumb. It's like saying "stop slavery in Africa" is equivalent to "vote ____"
I agree, but that does not make blizzards decision any less scummy or cowardly. All they're doing is watching their own ass and bottom line.
"I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"

They would have suspend him for a month that would have been enough. Taking the money, firing the caster and stopping the player to play in any tournaments for a year just because the man care about his city and want to talk about it is insane.

1/1 Chinese Prisoner. Can't attack. Dies next turn.
You know it
That's actually funny
Thx bro
I dont know how to work reddit but I appreciate you making this solid gold meme my good sir.
So you can rebuy everything to show your support?
In Hong Kong, gamers are deleting the games and their account. not only that, but also asking to take back their personal data for their own safety. this should add more work to their admins. according to EU law, if the data isn't processed within 30 days, Blizzard is liable for a heavy penalty too.

Please do the same. this could end up even worse for Blizzard in a month's time.
Just a few thousand ground into meatmush, no big deal. When the Chinese really get going, millions die.
This whole event will be causing board and C-level con calls and meetings all week at Blizzard as they attempt to muddle through the mess they‚Äôve created.
I'm equating it to using the grandmaster tournament platform to megaphone whatever cause you're trying to champion. You either have to try and decide what counts as a "worthy" cause you can allow people to talk about, or you blanket ban it. Blanket ban is the right choice, since it's impossible to come to any sort of concensus that would make any sort of overwhelming majority of people happy.
That's exactly the point for shareholders and employees. It's their business to stay in business, just like every business ever incorporated.
Those are just pictures of dead bodies without context. There is no evidence that these killings were unprovoked. The Chinese government acknowledges that about 300 people died in the RIOTS, including soldiers/police. Notice the picture of the burned, naked corpse of the soldier CRUCIFIED in the streets by the rioters. Notice the picture of the army tank in flames. Try that in America and see how far you get. Sit down, chile.

Save enough to buy someone else's organs in the future
100 points AND my organs?! Â•ΩÁöÑÔºÅ
Ok, message is sarcasm, but is it really so needed to put politics in gaming society? The guy who wanted just to get attention to the political problems in HK by breaking the game society is banned is good, isn't it? I support the protesters, but I fucking hate the politics. Democracy? Is it that funny game you play every four years, being a false dilemma itself, where you in 2016 chose between person, who promised to build a wall across the border and person, who wanted to drone assault Assange? Politic is always equals to a fucking hypocrite and lying human being, who will say what he thinks will be better for him. And you started to put this garbage to gaming society.

P.S. I'm probably wrong. If that, please explain why. I'm from Russia myself, and probably that is the reason, why I lost belief in politics.
Same here üòÇ

For an average internet user in China, this text will trigger the Great Firewall and their connection to the internet will be severed.
0/1 Chinese Prisoner you mean. It's not like they'll have the strength to fight back even if you silence them.
Ok that was good lol
Again, from a business perspective Blizzard is entirely within it's rights and it makes sense from their side of things.

My point was just that it wasn't some random political opinion that's being censored. It's a serious issue and that's why people are criticizing Blizzard on it.
>These are just pictures of dead bodies without context. There is no evidence that these deaths were unprovoked.

Yes, because there are actions that *provoke* running dozens of people over with tanks.   You're not serious. 

>Notice the picture of the army tank in flames. Try that in America and see how far you get. Sit down, chile.

In America we have this thing where we (normally) arrest people who are violent unless they're armed with guns.    When that's not what happens, it makes national news. 

What news did this make in China? Oh.  Right.  [Censored.]  Got it.  

>The Chinese government acknowledges that about 300 people died in the RIOTS, including soldiers/police.

Cables from the State Council place it closer to 10,000 actually.  But of course, if China says it was only 200 and some soldiers on top of that, you should believe them.   After all, it's not like they have ever lied before! ... Oh wait. 

You're unbelievable.
I‚Äôm glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family‚Äôs organs will not be harvested this month.
In democracy, politics overflow into popular media when the situation becomes serious. This is why freedom of speech works - the government can't completely tamp down on political activism without also shooting their own economy in the foot.

Believe in your friends, family, and yourself. Never give up! The moment you do, the enemy wins.

downvoted when i got to the first exclamation mark, then upvoted by the time i got to the end lol
Had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
A grandmaster play, if you will
Put it somewhere else. Blizzard doesn't deserve it
Could not find implicating evidence in the linked report
Its words and phases that China has censored
**Chinese national anthem intensifies**
Well not this block of text since reddit is blocked in China anyway.
Well, if you cast Submit to Communism, you can buff your prisoners +1/+1 this turn.
And again, it keeps blizzard from having to decide what counts as a "serious issue" when they just blanket ban it. It solves the problem before there's even a problem.

The guy could have said the same thing on Twitter, his own twitch stream while playing hearthstone, on reddit, on Facebook, on hundreds of other platforms and times. It is just one small space on the internet where Blizz wants to keep it "Hearthstone only, please".
I can see you think it's cool to have a villain in your world view. But I'm a "critical thinking" kind of guy. You seem to think that the tanks ran over people for fun. Let's forget the incident where a man stupidly stood in front of moving tanks to make a statement (and climbed on top of the tank and yelled something before being arrested). Bear with me - what if some of the rioters provoked the police and soldiers? You already showed me a picture of a soldier who was grabbed by rioters, burned, murdered, stripped naked and crucified in the streets. What if those that were killed were shot and subsequently run over while the tanks were trying to avoid the Molotov cocktails wielded by the rioters?  

By the way, there is literally no evidence that more than 300 people in total were killed. An anti-China organization called the "Tianamen mothers" stated that, in over 20 years of research, they couldn't identify more than 219 people killed.

You have been had, good sir.
Would forever remind the company of what has been done. I'd say one there and mayboe one somewhere more of significance to the freedom of speech to find a good compromise.
so you're expecting the chinese government to come out and admit they're doing that?

or are you expecting to read uncensored official material from a country with no freedom of press?

because i don't think anything outside the two above could convince you.

either way, it's wishful thinking....
I've seen that waiting times to get a transplant are abnormally short.

>The seven-member panel found it was "beyond doubt" that forced organ harvesting from prisoners has taken place "on a substantial scale by state-supported or approved organisations and individuals", in an interim judgement released in December.

You have downs syndrome! There are videos of police acting like protesters on a train just to attack them. There is a video of a group of police stomping a man's head while he lay motionless on the ground.

>I can see you think it's cool to have a villain in your world view. But

More like I refuse to believe you are actually this stupid, and I believe you're a shill or troll whose primary objective is to just shit on the west.  Noone with your command of *any* language thinks China is the least genocidal nation on Earth.

>But I'm a "critical thinking" kind of guy. 

Best laugh I've gotten all week.
Thanks for sharing. The number quoted in the article, 60,000-100,000 transplants a year, sounds about right, considering a population of more than 1.4 billion and assuming 1% death rate a year and 0.1% of that giving consent to transplant. But I‚Äôm interested in the tribunal‚Äôs filed report and I will look for it to see what is written in it.
No idea. I can't read Mandarin
Pink Floyd lyrics make you a troll? Ooor maybe you're just paranoid and xenophobic.
Where? And are you talking about TS or HK?
It took you 2 days to come up with that?
The problem is China claims only 300,000 people are registered donors.

Do you think a third of the registered donors died last year?
God dammit
Ah yes paranoid an xenopbobic. Anything else doc?
jesus the blatant Ignorance on this guy.
Sorry, I honestly forgot you existed until another user reminded me.
The whole point of that text is to try and trigger government censorship automatically since it's basically composed of banned/blocked words and events.
The butthurt equivalent of a wake-up call?
I find it ironic that to those who can't read simplified, the only uncensored words are the "forbidden" phrases.
and that, ladies and gentlemen, is the current state of china. a joke of a nation.

Blizzcon will be held in China? Otherwise it will be such an insane shitshow that i doubt it wont be canceled half way through, if it even happens.
Ok, making a top level comment for people who don't know this since I had to explain it a few times already.

**This is for *deleting* your battle.net account, not unsubbing.**

You can unsub from wow no problems, I did already. To actually delete your account (and forfeit everything you own the license to on battle.net) it appears they are asking for a photo I.D.

I'm not saying it's right or anything, but I want to make sure everyone at least knows what this is talking about.
Jesus fucking Christ. They are literally lockstep in line with China and the totalitarian bullshit.

J. Allen Brack MUST RESIGN. That prick is the absolute worst thing that ever happened to Blizzard
Come on guys go easy on them it‚Äôs a small indie company
You can sue for that.
Wait you can‚Äôt even delete your account anymore?

EDIT: THEY ARE ASKING FOR MY GOVERNMENT ID

WOW.

I CANNOT DELETE MY ACCOUNT WITHOUT PROVIDING MY GOVERNMENT ID.

ETA 2: I was not asked for my government ID when I signed up for my account, so I‚Äôm not sure *why* they need it *now*...
They are asking me to submit an ID with a picture.
This post actually scared me a little. My buddy just got me to play WoW for the first time ever last week and I was planning on canceling my subscription at the end of the month regardless. Luckily I had no problems cancelling though. I wrote ‚Äúyou know what this is‚Äù in the comments section for why I was cancelling.
On my first attempt they claimed I had too many attempts so I had to verify my deletion with my drivers license -_- I hope the amount of people leaving actually hurts them in a noticeable way.
Class action lawsuit. Suit up. Get in touch with your local legislators and your legal advisors.
EA is loving this right now
Provide an ID to a company that caters to a government known for human rights violations on epic scales? Sure. Sounds totally reasonable.

Honestly, I'd rather take a hit with my bank and just issue a chargeback. Request the cancelation, if they won't let it through then email the cancelation and tell them they are no longer authorized to charge your card. Then if they do, issue a chargeback and use the screen prints as evidence. Problem solved.

If enough people do it, then payment processors will start hitting them with higher fees. Right where it hurts.

Can we protest at their headquarters?

I already have a chant. 

*"IT SAYS HERE ON THIS ROCK.*

*YOU SHOULD NOT SUCK CHINA'S COCK"*
china level control
Seems like Blizzard lost their ‚ÄòTegridy‚Äô somewhere along the way
It's not even letting me change my account details without contacting customer support, and I'm not able to contact customer support without submitting a government issued ID. 

I have nothing to lose here, but I want to delete the account anyway. I've given them no data except my first and last name, and I have no games or subscriptions on the account.

I just want my name out of their mouth so I don't get the CCP's shoe polish on it. This is the kind of reprehensible bullshit I'd expect from bootlickers.
\#boycottblizzard

I will never in my life play a blizzard game again.
Boycott Activision as well - Blizzard died a long time ago and Activision is wearing its corpse
I love the light of a nice dumpster üî•. time to burn blizzard lol
This is illegal in the EU.

Fun's comming.
You know it's bad when the Blizzard sub is in open rebellion of the company
I'm about to file a data protection complaint in my EU country against Blizzard for refusing to delete my account or comply with data protection laws in EU without sending them a copy of my ID card.

Anyone in Europe that has encountered  this should report it as a GDPR breach as it possibly breaches the right to be forgotten ruling
Well it could be that if there is a lot of people doing the same thing it could be bogging down the services and disabling the function could just be a way to catch up on all the tickets. I hope you all realise your aren't going to affect those in charge right? You're going to harm those at the bottom first who have no control over this matter. I understand being angry for what happened just don't forget who will take any hit first.
Illegal.
The declined my account/personal data deletion although I attached a government issued ID. Well they should know better to not do that to EU citizens who are protected by GDPR.

Keep reposting this
DDOS them
I think that mass amount of people deleting accounts just triggered some automated protective mechanism. Every big company has that. I get it, people are pissed at Blizzard and they love to come to conclusions that will make company look even worse.
Read what it says? "due to too many attempts"
Is this actually happening because that picture shows a lock message from failed attempts to verify through email code not that it's actually disabled entirely.
Misleading, not true, making its rounds because of the China thing.

Not saying this person didn't run into issues, but it's a mighty logical leap to go from "I'm having issues" to "Blizzard is stopping everyone from deleting accounts."
Ill still play there games
gaymers rise up against account deletion prevention! we will show the chinese government who the real people in power are!
Isn't that full on illegal here in the states?
Isn't this super illegal here in EU?
Do you guys not have basic human rights?
Meh. I think that people would really regret deleting their accounts in 3 days after they cool their heads. Blizzard understands that human beings are irrational when they get emotional. I never heard of anyone struggling to turn off their subscriptions, just to delete their accounts. Which is a senseless move really? You've already paid for the games. You're not changing any meaningful numbers.
Of all the things to be mad at blizzard over, their servers getting destroyed should not be misconstrued as them "intentionally" disabling the ability to deactivate your account. This is almost certainly a technical issue.
I'm gonna get downvoted like crazy for this, but this is for deleting your account completely and all the data with it. You can still unsub at any time (I just unsubbed from WoW myself).

&#x200B;

They have been doing the ID thing for many years to delete your account. Just imagine if you played WoW since release for hundreds/thousands of hours and someone hacks your account and they delete all your data. People would suicide truck bomb Blizzard if they didn't have extra precautions against that.
Gotta make an Blizzard account and buy alot of shit from them.
This is bullshit.
correct me if im wrong (i dont live in EU) but doesnt the GDPR only apply to personal data (such as name, ids, etc)? so while they are required to remove your personal data, they do not have to comply with the account deletion request. (which is still bullshit, but not my question here)

thanks
Communists detected on American soil...
This is such sweet karma - they tried to take everything away from someone who grinded one of their games to be the best. A guy who risked his wellbeing to speak out for those less fortunate.

Now the bullys are getting bullied and it's glorious.
What happens if you send a photo ID with all the info photo-shopped as fake (except for the name of course) and the picture changed to one of those deep fakes faces of people that don't really exist. I mean what exactly do they have to check against? It's not like they got an ID from you to open the account in the first place.

Edit: Use this to edit your ID you do not want anyone connected to the Chinese Government to have your face on file:

https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/
Tried deleting my acc yesterday, it didn't work. Today it did though!  Buh bye
It's so very satisfying to see Blizz crumbling
This is illegal in the EU, you have the right to be forgotten.
Watching the Chinese dislike bots work over time with all these comments and posts xD Weird how they have thousands of upvotes on the post but almost no likes in comments
I‚Äôd like to see Blizzard collapse it‚Äôs American market. 

Maybe the cost of doing business in China is to lose business in America.
Lol this is just the lock out you get when you try to do something to many times like enter the wrong password. Yea get mad at Blizzard, but not make up fake shit.
Wtf... This is ridiculous.
Unpopular opinion: you can boycott and not pay them money without deleting the accounts you‚Äôve put a ton of money and time into already. Have fun rebuying the games in a year or two when you all have forgotten or they make the ceo resign and they right their wrongs.
Wow, i tried deleting my account maybe 10 hours ago and ran into this problem. Thought my account was bugged after being idle for a while, turns out it‚Äôs Blizzard. Taking another page out of the CCP, now we need exit visas to leave Blizzard.
I play videogames since 2002, I have never seen anything like this before. Not even by literal scum like Electronic Arts, Ubisoft, Bethesda or Epic Games. Wow, just wow. This is a whole new level of bullshit and scummy behavior. What happened to Blizzard?

First 2k sending thugs to threaten a Youtuber and now this? Jesus Christ.
[removed]
The irony of this situation, is I fully would never have known about this hearthstone caster's political views, if blizzard hadn't tried to silence him.

If anything, blizzard gave this movement a huge boost. Nice going, douche bags.
I think that while this would be an unpopular opinion since we are in a mob witch-hunting mode that this is actually intentional and understandable so, accounts nowadays are linked to game codes virtual currencies, etc, so to avoid mistakes or liabilities blizzard suspend the deleted account for 30 days and let you recover it in that period of time.-

Now we know well enough how this kind of mob mentality operates, and that from the people deleting their accounts, a lot of those whose accounts have in game items or games codes linked to it will either restrain for doing it or recover it later, which is dangerous in the middle of this massive influx of people doing so, because if they collapse the system now, they can delete the account, but if they collapse the system and don't let the people recover they accounts in the deletion queue it would be a customer service nightmare, so it's better to break the system prior, people that wants to delete their accounts for real, will do so today, next week or next month anyways, those who are just bandwagging will desist once the kool aid effect passes and we know it will.-

So it's completely understable from a social and business perspective to be more careful of your customers and guarantee that their service is working optimally than to risk those legitimate customers and prioritize on the mob.-

Let's be honest after all, how many of us that have spend a lot of money buying blizzard games, some in MT and years on WoW subscriptions would delete our accounts to protest this?

It may be some, but not many people will burn thousand of dollars and hours of time for the sake of a massive protest, and I'm not a blizzard fanboy, I have criticise them a lot of times before, but there's a long way from there to deleting a valuable account to make them know my point.-

In fact I personally feel more offended by the "you guys don't have phones" than for this, while haven't read the official tournament rules of Blizzard I'm pretty sure they should have some kind of clause against political speech and this player did just that, so while I may be wrong (in which case I will stand corrected) probably there were rules against what this player did, and he probably knew but didn't care, you may argue whatever you like or not this rule in this case in particular, but an infringement is an infringement, if a player use the tournament interview to pronounce against gun regulations, and for or against abortion, or other close to home more divisive topics in their local communities a lot of people will have wanted blizzard to censore too.-

So yeah, is a shame what happened but if there is a rule against that then THERE IS A RULE, and blizzard just did what it had, if there's no rule against it blizzard acted wrong, but let take out our social hypocrisy and say that if it is okay for someone to express their political views on a game tournament, then there is okay for everybody to do so, and whatever that opinion may be, whatever we like it or not.-

After all we need to be coherent and not bend the rules depending on whatever we agree or disagree with the topic at hand on a case per case basis.-
There‚Äôs an easy solution that would never happen cuz of our government corruption; but pass a law that no foreign company or national can own more than 5% of the company and that any company that does business in America must have 80% of its total investors and money from USA or they forfeit control of their company to select American shareholders who‚Äôd put country over profit

I‚Äôm a little outa the loop help me out‚Ä¶ why are ppl deleting their accounts to begin with
That's a new low.
Is this real?
I wonder if investors know their subscriber numbers they will likely put out at earnings are being manipulated.
They are down a lot too ?! Hmm
Did they just start doing this?  Or has it always been the policy?  If it's the latter, maybe it doesn't scale when lots of people want to do it at once...

Not happy with their HK response either, but trying to see if this is overblown.
G-amers R-ise U-p
I just sold all my shares in Activision/blizzard because of this. If you have any, now is the time. Hit them where it hurts most.
changed my name to Tiananmen89, hopefully they'll delete it for me
Can someone please summarise what is going on? Why do people want to delete their accounts?

Not being a smart arse, I‚Äôm just not aware of the latest news and have not played anything by blizzard recently.
/spit on Blizzard
blizzard prevents you from deleting your account so it doesn't look bad for share holders lol
What would happen if you canceled the credit card that you used to pay for the subscriptions with? is that an option to not providing your drivers license to kill the account?
If you don‚Äôt want to upload a photo of your ID, just change your automatic payment method to a Visa gift card, then go spend all the money on the gift card.
Why not just start hacking and get yourself banned.
If you are EU citizen - use GDPR rules! If you ask them to delete your data, they are obliged to do so!

Based blizzard üòÇ
Hit them with a GDPR request and then demand the data to be erased. Should be way more work for them than allowing you to delete the account using their service.
Just tell your bank to stop paying them
I understand and i'm pissed but why not just cancel all payments, clean your data and delete the launcher?
‚ÄúNo u kant unsubscribe pls‚Äù
On a related subject I refunded my WCIII pre-order that I forgot to refund along with my blizzcon virtual ticket and it says "Be aware that this refund was made as an exception, and future refunds are not guaranteed." To the more recent one, whereas my first which was much sooner after the news broke has the usual friendly normal blizz CS-type response. Also I say "normal" and "usual" having contacted customer service at least 10x (probably more) in the past 5 years over various issues. TBF I contacted a human on Livechat for the blizzcon ticket refund and was extremely polite to them because I know it's not their fault their top boss is busy sucking xi jinping's dick while they deal with irate customers all day.

Edits: clarity and wording and I'm tired so I can't fuckin type.
Are that many people deleting and unsubscribing from blizzard's services, that they had to panicky impose these last minute measures? I see this as an absolute win! And sadly this might be the end of a once legendary gaming company.
Was going to get a subscription last week but nah. Screw em
This is insane
remember hours ago when people said blizzard wasn't pro China. well, you're welcome to admit you too now cause that argument is disintegrated
Can't delete your account? Start doing charge backs on your cards and that'll get their attention. Money talks.
Can someone fill me in on what this is all about?
What, does your ID not have email addresses?
I requested my own data instead for now
I was I still had subscriptions so I could cancel them.
Any resources supporting this other than just a tweet? I just want to dig it more before making judgement.
You would think a company of this size would actually have a PR team worth something.
Call your cc company and cancel that way
If you are from the EU, invoke your GDPR rights to have any saved data on you removed.
I was boycotting blizzard before it was cool.
Just saying, I did make a post about this earlier, and I actually took a video of them declining me if anyone is interested.
Literally illegal...
I'm out of the loop, what did Blizzard do?
Wait wtf? Blizzard is blocking people from deleting their accounts?

It's bad enough that Blizzard is kow-towing to totalitarian despots, but now they're trying to force us to support their anti-democratic practices? That's so fucked. 

I'd love to see some sanctions for that behavior the same way we sanction any other company that is propping up murderous dictators.
Just when I thought nobody will beat EA...
So are we all moving to Final Fantasy XIV now? or what? Because I don't have any good excuses to my buddy that's been trying to get me to play for years and now I feel like I need to tell him my bad...
rebel scum
Normies ruin everything. Back when gamers were called nerds and shamed upon we didn't have bullshit like this. Gaming shouldn't have gotten so popular.
welcome to china, where you need to scan your face first to access to metro
Wait, wait, wait.. He broke a rule in the highest stage tournament held for the game is gets paid to play for a living, and now you're boycotting the company for sticking to their rules..? He even said he knew he was going to get in trouble for bringing politics into it and he did it anyway. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Can't wait for this years Blizzcon. This will be a s***show guys.
What? Is this even legal?
Rmb taste good?
I have heard very little about this whole Blizzard thing. Does anyone mind explaining what is going on?
As a EU citizen in compliance with GDPR you can demand Blizzard delete your data & account within 3 days or be legally accountable in EU court, EU court would love that free field day with blizzard fining them enmasse.

ü¶Äü¶Ä Blizzard is gone ü¶Äü¶Ä
WTF, they want to see my ID?!?
Nice blizzard. You played yourself.
As much as I don't agree with what they're doing, it is written in the Bible that all of this would happen. They are preparing everyone to accept the mark of the beast which is probably a chip implanted in your hand or a barcode/number Lasered onto your forehead. Pretty soon everything will be digitalised and unless you accept the mark of the beast you will not be able to buy or sell anything. I recommend you give your life to Jesus Christ while there is still time because things here on Earth are only going to keep getting worse. The Bible says that there shall come a time on this Earth so bad, the likes of which the world has never seen before and it shall happen suddenly within the space of half an hour, wake up quickly brothers and sisters.
I for one enjoy these pitchforks. If only it was as easy as deleting our accounts when it comes to politicians...
This can't be real
Good thing the EU has GDPR and the right to be forgotten.
Okay so for everyone moaning about having to give their photo ID, this isn't a new thing, and likely isn't related to Hong Kong at all.

My blizzard account was hacked 2-3 months back, and in order to verify it was me that owned the original email address tied to the account, I had to send them a scan of my driver's license.

10 minutes later I got my account back.

Stop making everything fit the outrage.
I've been trying to login to the blizzard store to cancel a couple of blizzcon exclusive figures i pre-ordered and i can't even log in to their store. Says my info is incorrect. 

Probably unrelated, but there's that.
I'm not super informed on the relationship between Activision and Blizzard, but this whole situation seems like a choice from Activision, as Blizzard employed have covered up the inspiration quote on the statue at HQ, and most likely are against this decision.

We can meme about game balance and loot boxes all we want, but this seems like a major shift in my eyes. I feel like Activision is the group to blame here.
Blizzard have always done this. I had to send my ID when I lost my authenticator. I'm not saying its necessarily right... But I think there would be more uproar if someone got into your account and could delete everything you owned just by clicking a button.
Change your payment and personal info to gibberish.
NO way bro, no way wtf how can this be real lmao
I didn't sign up with my personal ID, why should I need it to delete my account? Total bs.
what...what's happening, what's this all about?
What's going on? Why's everyone so upset? I just came from my vacation under the rock.
This is insane. Blizzard went from the standard games companies strived to attain to a corporate shill devoted to nothing but greed. I was playing classic and intending on playing 8.3 but nope not now
Stop playing and buying anything that has to do with Blizzard.
I'M going to repost exactly what I said in another thread about this because people are jumping to conclusions. I think everyone in the comments are overlooking something very important, if Blizzard allowed mass account deleting on this scale there would be no way to verify that everyone was protesting, being hacked or being maliciously deleted by a boyfriend, girlfriend, spouse, ect. It is easy to forget that humans are terrible so i'm sure some person or organization is most certainly taking advantage of the chaos and being terrible. For those of you complaining about IDs the reason behind it is consumer protection, if someone had taken your account they would be more likely to not hand over an ID as it has their real name on it and gives a solid trail on who to prosecute in the event it was stolen.
Well so long live capitalism with no one pulling the strings?
Hey, I'm a little bit confused what this is all about. If someone would be so kind as to give me a crash course on what's happening with blizzard?
This has gotta be illegal, right?
It‚Äôs illegal practice according to GDPR and EU citizens can actually sue them for this. I‚Äôm sure some EU lawyers would love to help because this sounds really clear cut. Apparently they deny even the last fallback to photo ID‚Äôs too: https://twitter.com/lolorcasm/status/1182055300683026433?s=21
Isn't this against GDPR? You are supposed to be able to request deletion of ALL of your data with no strings attached....
whew got out just in time.
That moment when Dashcon, the Tumblr convention with a half deflated ball pit  touted as the main attraction, will most likely have been less of a shitshow than BlizzCon this year.

Edit: I forgot to mention the ball pit reportedly had some pee in it
That doesn't sound very legal (at least it wouldn't in Europe)
Getting rid of blizzard launcher ASAP.
I have some reservations about these accusations, I believe more in an automatic security because a lot of account deletions is suspicious (a security in case of data theft for example) than a plot between Blizzard and China.

When Blizzard did something wrong, people want to think it's worst thant it seems, it's like with Diablo Immortal, people accused Blizzard to removed dislikes on YouTube (even Google didn't do that with their Rewind, how can Blizzard had the possibility to do that ?)

I honestly want to see Blizzard leaving the chinese market, it would be better for the creation of future games (but it may have Blizzard employees in China losing their job and some chinese esport players can have their career in danger)
If they wouldn‚Äôt let you cancel subscription or delete your accounts simply pull their  authorization to draw the subscription fee from your Bank account or advice your Online Payment provider to not do it for them.
> Under new EU laws you can also demand they send you the data they have on you, and if they fail to respond in (i believe 30?) days, they're subject to massive fines.

This is a much better strategy than people in the EU deleting their accounts.  If even a fraction of people do so, it may very well overwhelm their ability to respond to requests, which would subject them to extraordinarily huge fines.  And you'll get your data, which is great, because if they're owned by, and subservient to, an authoritarian dystopian nightmare like China, it would really benefit you to see the dossier they've accumulated on you.

This article has some info about the regulation.

EDIT:  A commenter below has provided an excellent form letter people can send to Blizzard requesting specific types of personal data.  This is really great.  I know Blizzard has disabled their automated system, so it would be worth it to print this out and snail mail a copy to Blizzard HQ.

EDIT:  Another commenter details the inanity of complaints that people utilizing this law will somehow "get it taken away

A lawyer or legal expert int he EU should weigh in here on how exactly people should go about doing this though.

EDIT:  People have said they can file for an extension if they are backlogged with requests.  I've heard 2 months of extra time.  I would say that's fine.  They can't just not fulfill the request.

Keep in mind the GDPR are new laws.  The EU may be looking to make an example of companies, and may come down harshly on Blizzard for non-compliance, especially given Blizzard's stance on Hong Kong and them going to bat for China.

EDIT:  Additional people are claiming (without citation) that courts would throw these requests out because they were organized.  I would like someone with knowledge of the legal system in the EU to weigh in, but I am extraordinarily dubious about this.  For one, Blizzard would have to prove each request was legitimately "malicious".  For two, laws aren't usually chucked out the window because it's "hard" for companies to comply.

EDIT:  Naysayers keep insisting that utilizing an existing and unambiguous law is "abusing" it.  I would say that authoritarian China owning a 5% stake in Blizzard and Blizzard taking a clear stance in favor of authoritarianism and suppression and treating advocacy for Democracy as hate speech represents an extremely urgent need for everyone in the EU to figure out what data Blizzard is accumulating on them, and then delete it to ensure it does not fall into the hands of monstrously murderous authoritarian regime.

That's why the law exists in the first place.  Insinuating they will "take it away" if you use it is absurd.

And if it turns out that the requests are easy for Blizzard to field, then the worse that happens is you took five seconds to get your personal data and now know what Blizzard accumulated on you and can make the informed decision whether or not to delete your data.

That's a good thing.  Every person on Earth should have unencumbered access to the totality of what corporations are accumulating about them online.  It's your data, not their property.

We do not live in fear of corporations.  We do not owe them the courtesy of making their lives easier.  If they can skirt existing laws because those laws are "hard", then we know the laws need to be strengthened.

EDIT:  A lot more HailCorporate people here then I would have ever expected.

It's really interesting that so many people are so concerned for the welfare of massive companies and so sympathetic with their plight to hand over personal data they collect on their users.  They're very upset that mean people would dare to abuse the law by simply requesting that data.

There is, of course, a really easy way companies could comply, instantly, with these requests: stop compiling and reselling user data.

Blizzard doesn't have to stick a tracking device on me and monitor every other website I go to after I visit them, log which games I play for how many hours, log my buying behavior on their loot boxes, sequence my genome to determine my suscpetibility to dopamine slot machines, and so on, and it certainly doesn't need to bundle that data and sell it to the highest bidder.

They could just, I dunno, make good games?

This is all a copy and paste
Pro-tip for Europeans: they have the legal obligation to remove any information they have about you within 30 days, so simply find a contact form and ask them.
You guys are racist for hating chinese people.
I don't know why everyones having trouble deleting your account, apparently you just need to send some anti-china memes and they'll delete and ban your account for you, no ID needed /s lol.
I hope their stock price plummets to all time lows
Wouldn't the FTC be able to do something or at least have some reports about it if enough people people brought it to them.
BoycottBlizzard!! Delete wow!
EU GDPR
So all that SJW virtue signalling pandering from a corporation (and all the others like Google, Apple, etc) was just for show?

I'm shooketh
Blizzard CS's official response to this is that it's a site issue.

https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/with_replies
Isn't removing methods against GDPR?
My LGS is an amazing, inclusive space that just celebrated its 1 Year Anniversary a couple days ago. It‚Äôs situated close to a prominent University that has a predominantly Asian student body. The LGS relies on Blizzard products for a majority of its business. I fear for the fallout from all of this on wonderful places like my LGS.
Ohhh theres a massive law suit waiting to happen....  learnt nothing from facebook I guess
I tried to delete my account a while back and they wouldn‚Äôt do it because I didn‚Äôt send a picture of my passport that wouldn‚Äôt even prove anything anyway. Hate this company üòÇ
I believe this is illegal in the EU, GDPR gives you the right to be forgotten.
Any idea if asking for ID for account cancelation is illegal in Canada?
Holy shit, that‚Äôs fucked.
So i can't delete my account anymore?
This is ridiculous. They ban user from login to their own account in order to stop them from delete their account. WTF
Just to put my experience in. It took me about 30 seconds to put in my request for account removal and I got an email within a couple minutes approving the process. Not issues here. I did not have a mobile authenticator on my account so that helped.
I just deleted my Blizzard account. Screw them.
lets just take a step back to appreciate there are a lot of staff just as outraged and they arranged a walkout in protest of the decision.
Hol'up isn't that 100% illegal in most civilized countries ?
Errrm... Is now the good time to ask how this will impact BlizzCon 2019?  


They timed this so good it's almost unbelievable... I don't think this time "wait for a week and things will sort themselves" will workout this time.
ITT: people acting like Blizzard asking for your ID is new. 

It is NOT new. When I got hacked 6 months ago they made me verify with my license. 

**YOU CAN CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WITHOUT YOUR ID.  YOU ONLY NEED YOUR ID TO DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT. OTHERWISE HACKERS WOULD DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AFTER THEY HACK YOU**

Please stop being dramatic so that you can karma farm. This is not new. This is not an attempt to stop you due to anything China related. This has always been protocol.
Hopefully all these deleted account balance out the games a bit
Did this start to happen after Destiny 2 left their store? or is this because the whole China thing
i can delete it without any problems
Is this only in the US? In Europe this is a major lawsuit waiting to happen otherwise. GDPR rocks
just wanna delete acc, only used it for destiny. dont need it anymore now
THEY DO THIS A LOT, HARD TO UNINSTALL THEIR GAME NOW.  THEY USED TO HAVE UNINSTALL FUNCTION RIGHT NEXT TO THE GAME TAGE, NOT ANYMORE
This was cross posted to the r/gaming subreddit. Had tens of thousands of upvotes and 8 awards, and no it has completely disappeared?
You have to face the consequences of your actions Blizzard!!!

I hope you lose 80% of your playerbase because you are awful company as of for now!!!

\#Boycotblizzard
I‚Äôm trying to cancel subscription and won‚Äôt let me continue past the survey screen.
At the risk of being labeled a shill.... never attribute malice to something that can be explained by incompetence.

This is ten thousand percent a technical issue. Too many people trying to access the webpage overloading it.

The people posting these things is unfortunately are scaremongering (even if it's not done on purpose). People don't know what they're talking about -> see something negative -> their brain makes a leap of logic -> it happens to be the things that helps their case the most -> you get this.

Not saying you shouldn't delete your account if you want, but don't place such an idiotic level of evil on what is absolutely a technical issue.
Perfect time to go make a ticket claiming un received purchases.......
Ok, I never played a game through battlenet, but I have an account with no purchases, main info or anything. Just email address and name (and any mandatory info they needed for sign up). What benefit do they get by seeing my ID? I saw on a blizzard forum someone said to prevent false deletions, or "vindictive ex spouses". Sorry, but if someone like that is going to the effort of deleting my account, they probably already have access to my ID. Is this even legal? How is a photo of my ID going to be different to a two (or more) step verification that uses the info you already have. Better yet, what if a woman had an account and got married, her ID will have a different surname...
Isn't this illegal? Blocking methods for people to stop supporting them gives them the opportunity to lie about the pr shitstorm to shareholders by giving them boosted numbers of people still staying with them. Feel free to educate me if I got anything wrong.
But I need to farm LBRS, UBRS and get Rank 10
Why do I feel like China is filled with people with ill intentions.
Blizz sux
Didn't this post just lose like.. Thousands of comments?
Don't need to tell me twice, after playing 17,000 games of Starcraft 2 it was a surprisingly easy uninstall + boycott when I found out the shit they did.
[removed]
No, I had this problem before all of this started.

Their site is genuinely bugged, I had the exact same thing like two weeks ago
Such thing it's actually illegal in EU. It violates laws on data treatment.
Lmao wtf is going on.
All this on the eve of Blizzcon...well they shot themselfs in ass with that. They could just ignore what that dude said and then apologize to their asian masters. But no, I think that this shitstorm will go away pretty soon, but oh boy it will be remembered.
i was planning on not spending any money on blizzard games, but i wouldn't actually have deleted my account if this hadn't happened.
I just sent them a screenshot to GDPR right to be informed page lol
Blizzard has also changed their "Delete Blizzard Account" article on their website. 

https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/2659

See "Updated 20 minutes ago"

Now it says you have to request a deletion an that Government ID may be required.
Europe has the right the be forgotten, does this not break this rule?
Does this include the ID vertification? I had to send in my ID to verify my account to speak woth the support.
Just pirate their games, run bots, screw with in game economies and buy second hand copies of Diablo 1 and stream that while constantly repeating I will not buy any new Blizzard/Activision games.  No point in burning games, boycotting (non subscription based games) or anything that doesn't impact their bottom line. Just play the shit out of them but don't give them a bloody penny. Make them burn their resources. .
I requested to delete my account and it was surprisingly easy. I guess it is because I am from Canada? They didn't asked for any ID.
Yea that's actually illegal in Europe due to GDPR laws.
I'd pay actual money if i could learn exactly how many people canceled their accounts after all this is said and done.  I'm curious to see how long this furfer keeps up and how much it'll cost Blizzard/EA.
are they not going to apologies?
Oh man, just once EU, please, get this one right and go all GDPR on their asses

I hated blizzard before it was cool /s
Isn't it illegal to do this?
Great to see that everything is being spread by now. Even if it turns out to be wrong and a technical error at this point.
And for the younger viewers, Blizzard was a company that was deeply loved in the 90s. Nowadays their name is usually followed by a scoff.
 Damn it, blizzard.
I‚Äôve been subbed for the better part of 3 years straight and playing since 2004, even including time‚Äôs I haven‚Äôt even played for a few months. I just let them have it because you know, it‚Äôs a company I love and have grown up with. I will be unsubbing for now, even though looking at future patches on the PTR and game direction is giving me a huge rock on. I just hope Allen can see what he‚Äôs done here, learn and restore the faith I had in Blizzard in the first place. 

Unlikely, but its in my human rights to have dreams, right?
Here is Jeff Kaplan‚Äôs response to all the recent events https://thehardtimes.net/harddrive/jeff-kaplan-calmly-explains-why-its-important-to-balance-human-rights-with-chinese-money/
Lol they like kids. Think that if they close ey–µs problem will be solved
Isn‚Äôt this against the European law for data protection? 

They can‚Äôt block you from deleting your account and asking them to remove your personal information from their database
Never heard of them til yesterday, when these started popping up on All. Consider the awareness spread.
Absolutely support for Blizzard !! Bravo guys!
Glad that I dont have a blizzard account
If you're not allowed to cancel, issue a charge back on your credit or debit card.

> One of the most common reasons for a chargeback is a fraudulent transaction. In this case, a credit card is used without the consent or proper authorization of the card holder.

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chargeback

Preventing you from stopping a transaction is the definition of an unauthorized purchase.
Been nice knowing ya Blizzard, not even Diablo 4 can save you from this mess.
It hurt but I deleted my Blizzard account.  Couldn't hurt near as much as what those protestors are experiencing.
Im pretty sure thats illegal, at least in europe
now suddenly every one loves gamers going off half cocked. next week we will be back to being nazis
Fucken dogs
I didn‚Äôt have to thankfully
Remove your payment method...
time to start putting some compaines OUT OF BUSINESS
Just something to point out, when receiving a ton of account deletions it will often trigger something in IT security to try to slow things down/stop things to make sure it that there isnt a big chunk of them that are hacked accounts or something of the sort.

Dont get me wrong blizzard is a shit company and has lost all my respect. I just wanted to point out this particular move isnt necessarily bad practice from a cyber security standpoint.
Is it even legal in EU? I mean we have GDPR.
Unbelievable.
A company disables an option due to overloading requests? Absolutely unheard of /s
Blizzard is dead to me.
Blizzard did not disable them, they have technical problems with their system and are looking into it, like their support twitter account said.
Half-life 3 confirmed
Damn I‚Äôll have to buy an Activision Blizzard game now so I can make a statement and delete my new account!
This is like the 6th post I‚Äôve comment on in the last couple days but why is everyone hating blizzard so badly
No!!! Your data is ours! You cant delete your accounts, we are farming data for china.
When your an Paladins/Hi-Rez Fanboy watching the news
**chews gushers obnoxiously** ah I‚Äôm glad I made that switch from blizzard to Hi-Rez years ago... Blizzard is getting all that they deserve...
If you want play ow but not ow play Paladins it‚Äôs moar fun and FREEEEEEEEEEE... like come on guys just play it‚Äôs really fun like there is literally a guy who has an ult that launches you to space and another guy who can teleport to any enemy on the map assassinate them and teleports back and t pose on em, Also a tank with SELF REZ THAT ONE SHOTS EVERY ONE IN THE AREA LIKE I CANT MAKE THIS SHIT UP...
They're probably just in the middle of regulating the insumermiuntable hack attempts made on people's accounts
Just deleted mine, no issue, UK.

Not making a statement or anything just had an account that i don't use that just has WoW, Black Ops 4 and Destiny 2 on that maybe have a handful of hours in each of them so no real loss to anyone.
Will the die hard customer really leave ?
Deleted both of my accounts, one was created in 2004 for beta.  Regardless of how this all plays out in the end, I think that we will see more and more of this kind of thing going forward.

China was smart to invest in so many online/gaming companies for this reason.  They have a large teet, and once you start suckling it will be impossible to stop.

They will slowly, over time, impose their values on us indirectly through the companies they in part own.

Eventually, we too will need a webcam and facial recognition to get online and buy groceries if this continues.  This is a reality in China already and should scare the rest of the free world.

They are playing the long game here, and this should be a huge wake up call to us all.
Playing devils advocate, that could be an automatic system.
I just initiated the deletion process. The SMS authentication worked for me. That said, who knows if they'll come back asking for more.
Would Blizzard make more money if they took an active stand against the Chinese government? I would probably buy some games if that happened.
Can someone actually confirm this? I've just seen this same screenshot reposted a billion times and no other reports of the same thing.
Another one bites the dust
Contact your CC company/bank and have them block payments to your accounts.
Or maybe they are having technical difficulties....
I don‚Äôt get it, is it no longer possible to delete accounts or can anyone delete an account.
Ok, so ive come here from a crosspost to find out whats going on, as ive only seen like 2 things through memes with Mei. Can someone please fill me in?
Remember, if you have a credit card on file at BLIZZARD call your credit card company and have them put a stop to any charges BLIZ tries to charge you.

You might not can delete your account but this should send the same message.
Whoa can we keep the Gender neutral, and just Cott them.
I had to submit a ticket with a picture of my ID in order to get my deletion processed.  I've been told by several people that the photo ID is required to actually delete your entire account because they have to do everything they can to confirm it's actually you making the request and not a sibling, jilted ex-girlfriend, etc.
Is this verified?
Man, why do companies have to screw up so massively? I just got my golden gun as roadhog!
Time to sue them hoes
Deleting your account vs don't play. How's that different?
If you didn't start boycotting Blizzard after the BnetD lawsuit, I don't know what to tell you.

Blizzard has been this awful for a long, long time.
Didn't stop me.
Can someone explain to me what the hell is going on?!
I can do without Blizzard games. We need to stand in solidarity for democracy against communism and spineless capitalism.

Delete your Blizzard account. Choose a different game.
Just deleted my blizzard account, asked for 1 authentication and then said it will update me after it sorts it out
I told them on a ticket i would go with it to the court, sonce it is illegal to do this in EU, and they even helped me to delete it.
Question for people in the EU, Doesn't this violate the right to be for gotten laws?
 

I know this seems like a boomer thing to do, but file a complaint with the Better business bureau. If they want to stay accredited with the organization they have to respond personally to ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS INDIVIDUALLY.

So what nerd, good for them
So blizzard is laying in bed with communist China??
It seems like Blizzard took a page out of the Todd Howard book of ‚ÄúHow to Run a AAA Game Company‚Äù.
At this point they should just change their name to "Blizztard".
To add to the insult, they've got [a fundraiser for a team for one of their tournaments in a frontpage post in the overwatch subreddit.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/dfwaml/team_hong_kong_needs_your_help_getting_to_the/) That's how brazen this company is, they won't even stop advertising their tournaments on reddit in the face of all this backlash, and they have fans willing to go along with it. In the face of *massive* human rights violations and what's fast becoming an international incident.
Blizzard is now gay comfirmed.
I cant believe it. Bethesda said "watch me do everything wrong and lose fans with FO76", amd Blizzard said "hold my beer"

This is incredible
Luckily i was able to, SMS confirmation worked.
Did they always ask for an id when you want to delete your account?
Why does it seem like Bliz is always in shit. Like i get it happenes to every conpany at some point but it feels like its been nonstop for them since bfa came out
Just report the card you have on file with them as stolen. Get a new card and a new number. Your old card won‚Äôt work anymore so they can‚Äôt bill you anymore. Problem solved.
And throw away my 15 years of memories ? Far from my bed show, I am fine thank you. Besides, states clearly: no political statements.
Definately getting rid of my blizzard account. I didn't play it much anyway. But they have my CC info and I'm no longer comfortable with them having it.
Don't delete your account. Use it. Why protest when you can humiliate.
Isn't this illegal? Just because they disabled the function doesn't mean that they aren't still required to uphold the law of the land
 Hijacking your comment to say, if you or anyone your know plans on deleting their account, don't just delete your account! You can request your Data from Blizzard and if they dont follow trhough within 30 days they have to pay hefty fines inside the EU. If everyone does this, they might have such an enormous backlog and will have to pay up. More details here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfcncg/dont\_just\_delete\_your\_account\_you\_can\_request/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfcncg/dont_just_delete_your_account_you_can_request/)
*unable to delete account* tHis iS dISCuStiNg!
My favorite method of deleting accounts is getting a new credit card.  Yes that‚Äôs right, I burn my life down about once a year and start anew in the ashes.
Boycott China ya fuckin fool of a Took.
Cease and desist letters are easy to write, just saying.
I'll take anyone's unwanted wow account
If you're from the EU and cannot delete your account without providing government ID, **Make a complaint to the ICO!**

Took me about 5 minutes and all they required was a transcript of the chat log where they refused to deleting my account information without a passport. The more people that complain, the more likely it is that the ICO will take action. So please don't just take their refusal lying down. Complain!
I hate Blizzard so much. Their games are great but their company is a mess and a joke.
Karma would be exiling these companies to China. If you want to be lockstep with the Chinese government then go be owned by them.  It's totally unrealistic, but if you want to be a puppet of the Chinese government, then actually go be a part of the system you're pushing for.
I don't know how serious this accusation is. I tried making some substantial changes to my WoW account right around the time of TBC release(like 12 years ago) and they asked me for a faxed in picture of my photo ID. I feel like this is just their method of you are who you say you are and not someone who's hacked into your account.
YSK: you can report an unauthorized transaction to your bank and they will block Blizzard from taking any more money if you have auto-pay set up.
It's like they care about money more than the wishes of people who play their video games...
üòÜ what a nightmare
Just like they do in China
It that even legal?
Start shorting Activision Blizzard stock lol.
Hello gamers. This isn't actually true
I don't have a Blizzard account. But now I want to sign up for one just so I can delete it.
Imagine if you found out they sold you info to china that would be stupid I know but it's not out of realm of possibility.
Isn‚Äôt this right here a type of fraud? Can we report the company to the FTC or something?

Hell tweet this to the President of the United States even
MAKE EVERY CHARACTER FROM EVERY BLIZZARD FRANCHISE A SYMBOL OF HK FREEDOM, NOT JUST MEI.  
WoW: Saurfang/Derek Proudmoore  
Diablo: The Monk  
Hearthstone: The Tavern Keep Dwarf dude  
StarCraft: Raynor??? (I never played the games)
Pretty sure this is due to high traffic. It seems you can delete your account as of today
Damn I just want to play OW
Do t trust Blizzard with your information anymore, they may try to sell it to China/Chinese companies to abuse to high hell and back. Especially don‚Äôt give them any government identification which Blizzard is apparently now suddenly asking for.

Didnt they do similar do stuff when mass people were leaving because of the Diablo Immortal announcement?
protecting themsevles from all the bandwagon kids that want the account termination email, so they can then just re-enable their accounts.
I'm confused to what is happening atm with blizzard? Can I get a tl:Dr?

This is bullshit. China is trying to censor the world. This is not right. Please share his post throughout Reddit among the comments so people will see what they are trying to do to us.
Serious question - does she really expect a ‚Äúcompany of this size‚Äù to act responsibly?
It's a reasonable strategy. 

Keep players accounts open and then once the hype blows over they'll be far more likely to log back into an existing account than to start a new one from scratch down the road.

If they won't delete your account, just remove all the information or change it to bogus information. REMOVE all of YOUR CREDIT/DEBIT cards especially. When this whole mess started, that was the first thing I did.
What's hilarious is that this technique will work. A sizable chunk of you bandwagoners will forget about this in a week and go back to playing...
This... This has to be illegal right?
If you're in the UK, you can write to them instructing them to send you all of the data they have on you - or delete it. It's under the new gdpr guidelines.

So if they won't let you delete your account, use this law to force them to do it for you. If they refuse, or don't do it within the time frame (I think a month) then you can sue them and/or report them to the authorities responsible for managing it.
Guess we're raiding Blizzard HQ in 2020
I've been trying to get a refund for Warcraft Reforged preorder since yesterday and all refund requests are automatically denied as soon as you submit them (EU). They ask you to submit a ticked to "manually solve this", but they didn't respond since yesterday either.

I saw people (US) saying they had their refund requests resolved immediately, but many people in EU seem to be unable to do so. I don't know what is Blizzard pulling.
Guess it‚Äôs time to drive to California.
This was proven false. He have to be better than this. Blizzard has done enough shitty things; we have no reason to make false claims.
keep pre-ordering Call of Duty, please help China to grow stronger
Honestly I think this is a good move on Blizzard's side.

When this shitshow eventually gets left in the past people will start regretting deleting their accounts and will start begging for their stuff back which just screws over everyone in the end.
Blizzard has been sucking Chinese money for long now
Am I the only one who‚Äôs pissed off by blizzards handling of this, yet unwilling to pretend I never played or enjoyed any of their games for some worthless internet posturing?
I really don‚Äôt think this is a right/left issue. I think this is something most people agree on.
EA: Man... We sure are the most hated gaming company of all time these days... No one can top our Suprise Mechanics.

Blizzard: *drunken mutters* HRRRR lemme get a shot
Boycott blizzard
Yo keep sucking china's dick Blizzard / Activision.
I sinserely hope this shit blizzard becomes a boat anchor for the company that never goes away.
I'd like to believe its blizzard being a dick, but seems likely there was an overload, not malice.
Maybe a dumb question, but isn't it kind of illegal to deny removing someone's account? It's technically personal information that they're keeping without your permission. Might just be in the EU though
Are you proud of what you've become, America?
Should be illegal
How to avoid losing 5% of stock market from a chinese company: Disable account deletion and post a "all players need to be treated equally, however" text wall.
Fake
It's going to be an interesting couple weeks for blizzard CS when people who delete their accounts realize they've thrown away things they've already paid for and open tickets to try to get it back. 

I mean it's one thing to cancel your WoW sub or refund an order, but deleting your Blizzard account just seems like robbing yourself of something you already paid for.
Ever try remembering your own security questions?
I smell a class action lawsuit
By this point, Blizzard has long lost my appreciation and any loyalty I might‚Äôve had, and they just. Keep. Going. 

I would complain but the schadenfreude is just too sublime.
This is how you know the "we were just enforcing tournament rules" argument is bullshit.

If that was the case, then people should be free to delete their accounts.
Ability to delete your account seems to be back.
Vote with your wallet - if action is not taken by Blizzard to walk this back, reverse the narrative here, I'll never buy Blizzard again. Already submitted my request for account deletion.
blizzard need to end
it's CHINAZI's culture, please say no to CHINAZI
Mmhmm. We'll see what happens when Hearthstone 2, Overwatch 2, the next WoW, etc. comes out and gets straight 9's and 10's. Guarantee all their fans are buying day 1, if not preorder
I haven‚Äôt even looked at their financial reports so idk were I stand beyond I like COD
Is this grounds for a potential legal dispute? Anyone with some knowledge in law care to give some insight?
Finally WOW killer.
Call your credit card and tell them not to authenticate any "purchase" by blizzard and to do charge backs
If you wanted to delete your account (for any reason) and now you can't, an alternative is to get banned.
wow ... blizzard descends into mimicking communist governments keeping their people constrained and not allowing them to leave. We dont even need to meme them ... they are meme-ing themselves!
so, any confirmation on this? i know both the email code and secret question options both got denied on the first attempt of each for me and i'm NOT giving them my photo ID (that they request that in the first place simply to delete a persons account is HIGHLY suspicious and a great flaming red flag imo)...

but i don't know what this 4th method is. unless that might be getting a forum ban...if so...WOW...just wow...

but regardless of whether or not that's true, this is a majorly F'ed up situation and i've gone ahead and purged any and all billing info and changed what personal info i could to junk data on top of uninstalling bnet.

i'm not supporting this and i sure as heck am not supporting china and that company, tencent, that's been invading media here in the west.

epic games...now blizzard...hollywood for our movies (no, tencent...if YOU'RE the publisher of a movie, it's a guarantee on my part that i'll be pirating the movie if i decide to watch it. you're getting nothing at all from me.)...like the newest terminator movie.
Blizzard makes games and they are neutral about politics you idiots. Clearly that guy broke Blizzard's rules and they did a right thing.
When junkies revolt....

Once a cracker always a cracker...
Just wondering what did blizzard actually do? I've seen a bunch of posts about it but I don't know what's going on.
Keep at it. They can‚Äôt hold you all forever.
Since Blizzard won't let me remove my account, I've deleted all the data I can, and changed my battle net name to 'freehongkong'.

Best I can do
maybe in China, deleting your game account requires the Party's permission.
So they are censoring EVERYONE now? Thats how you fix an issue that was centered around censoring one person, censor everyone!! Good job blizz!
Just spam their request for ID pictures with horse dicks.
This is a simple fix. Say something about the Hong Kong protestors and get your account deleted.
I noticed this the other day and thought there was something up with their servers or what have you. Really scummy move on their behalf. I uninstalled their launcher from my PC so at least I can boycott them, too bad it can't be done permanently at the moment.
TURN THEM OVER TO THE BBB -- this is a government agency set up to investigate things like this -- they WILL take it seriously if you give them real information

I hope they know a lot of lawyers for the impending class action law suit. If course they do, since they are mostly Jewish.
IF WE CANNOT DELETE OUR ACCOUNTS THEN WE SHALL GET THEM PERMABANNED!
They just keep digging themselves deeper. Put the damn shovel down
So they are in effect forcing me to do business with a propaganda wing of the chinese communist party. thanks Blizzard.
So I am pretty shocked they would prevent account deletions. Wouldn‚Äôt this be considered illegal if their TOS did not previously state that accounts could not be deleted when you signed up?
This isn‚Äôt legal, is it? How might one go about lawyering up for this?
They want me to send them my ID scan. Is this even legal?
/r/OutOfTheLoop why people are trying to delete their accounts?
April fools?
Okay. Fine, let's play blizzard. Everyone change every name they can to FreeTibet or something like.
Blizzard has really gone downhill..
They are literally asking for government issued photo ID to delete your account. Holy fucking shit this can't be real LMAO. I'm sure people can sue about this, this is beyond petty
Good thing I never got a Blizzard account in the first place.
notice how all the top comments have barely any upvotes. sounds like someone are paying for downvotes haha
Guys it's a video game company. A video game company with a stance that affects your life in zero ways....
I think they've invested too much into the event to really pull out. They'd have to refund thousands of tickets. They'd lose probably a million or more dollars on that alone. The tickets start at $200, or $50 for a virtual ticket. 

I'm really curious what they're going to do. People are going to show up and there are going to be people in pro Hong Kong dress. Whether that be umbrellas, t-shirts, pins, to full on cosplay. That isn't even mentioning people who are going to try and sneak in signs or chant for Hong Kongs freedom.
At this point they might as well hold Blizzcon in China for all intent and Purpose. 

They called China "Our Country" in their apology TO China .... They didnt apologize to The player in Hong Kong or the Casters in Taiwan or their playerbase in the Western Countries but TO CHINA.

&#x200B;

They might as well move to China and sell their shitty games over there for all I care. 

&#x200B;

Why dont we just expel the company from the US and bar them from western markets so they can fully embrace their new communist party friends in China. Lets see how they like it over there since they seem so keen to suck China dicks for market share.
At this point going is tacit support
I think they‚Äôll have to cancel it. If not they risk streaming a massive shitshow with audience chanting for Hong Kong. Massive balls/incompetence if they don‚Äôt.
Diablo immortal should be announced soon, I think they're counting on China market for huge chunk of revenue from it. Possibly more IPs on mobile for their market.
Or there will be "technical issue" with the Q&A section, or some bullshit like there was always harrassment KiLl Me PlEaSe...
I wonder what's even going to happen; on most reddit "boycotts" nothing ever happens because reddit is such a minority.
It will go on completely normally. Not even half of 1% of people in the US will care enough about this to make any kind of a scene. Also buying a ticket supports them so if you're boycotting them for this you won't be there.
It is not just about freeing Hong Kong. it is about freedom of speech and expression (which are rights) and that an American company which tencent has a petty 5% hold in values money and we have to make a stand.

South park as a series was banned over one episode. China would not hesitate to ban all Blizzard Activision games. It has too much to lose. This is why Blizzard Activision took such extreme measures.

This is without a doubt our last chance to prove that we value freedom over money.
Atendees should all dress as Hong Kong Mei!
We still have a little less of a month to go. They‚Äôre probably hoping people forget by that time. We need to make sure that doesn‚Äôt happen.
Idk, 80% of their playerbase probably haven't even heard about the drama. Many people don't care about professional scenes/tournaments at all, and not everyone is on reddit all day either.
They should set up a booth at Blizzcon specifically for account deletion.

It'll be the longest line at the convention.
Would China even allow it?
They‚Äôve done that for years though. 7 years ago my account was hacked and got banned and I had to call support. They asked for a photo ID to verify that I was who I say I am. They just matched the name.

I mean it makes sense in this case for standard procedure to be an ID. If this China fiasco wasn‚Äôt happening, I wouldn‚Äôt want someone to be able to delete my account without that extra layer of security.
Thank you for commenting this
Thank you for posting this.

To add on to this post, you can still unsub to whatever you don‚Äôt want to play. But having to delete the actual account requires a much more involved process.

A friend of mine was suicidal and thought she was quitting forever. So she deleted her characters on WoW. A few bouts with depression later, she came back and regretted her decision and contact support to assist her. They recovered her account pre-deleting conditions.

Completely terminating an account to oblivion is not something companies will do. If the cause for deletion ends up being fraudulent, the company can be placed in a difficult situation.

I understand people are upset with what‚Äôs going on, but be careful to not be a victim of sensationalism.
Don't forget to also explain how Blizzard isn't actually preventing account deletion in the first place.

This tweet's been making its rounds and because it's the current popular topic on the Internet, it's being treated as absolute gospel with no actual proof behind it.

(Some folks *are* having issues deleting their accounts. Keyword being "some." There is no systemic account-delete-block in place. That's absurd to even consider (what exactly does Blizzard gain from doing that, outside getting snubbed more online?).)
I really have to wonder about anyone who read "... to actively stop people from **deleting** their accounts." and thought "Oh my gosh they're preventing people from *unsubscribing*?"

Someone reported that they showed photo ID but still got their request denied
So the Chinese government wants our faces too, eh?
I have my battlenet account with only 5‚Ç¨ on it, i don't have any games there(since Destiny migrated thankfully), so why should I share my photo ID?

My identification document is worth more than sending it to a company in which I have no trust to hold that information secure.

Specially because this was not clearly communicated to me when creating the account as a needed process.
It makes sense that they‚Äôd require identification when forfeiting all purchases and accounts.
Do you mind explaining why people are deleting their blizzard accounts? I‚Äôm out of the loop. What did they do?
Deletion is a right under GDPR so I'm pretty sure this is illegal in the EU
Sadly, the crowd that already had a major hate boner against Blizzard won't see this reason, they're too busy with their outrage culture. 

They are not preventing the deletion of accounts, but the safety steps remain, as they should to prevent any hacker from just deleting the account they've taken. Duh.
After submitting my ID, the same one I've used for a decade, they denied my request.
> it appears they are asking for a photo I.D.

...and not accepting it. 

I've twice tried submitting a deletion request, submitting my photo ID, but neither time has it actually gone through. First time it failed with no error message, second time with a message to say it didn't work.

I've submitted a ticket. They've got 30 days to comply, or it's an ICO complaint.
You think you want basic human rights, but you dont.

You committed the ultimate cardinal sin, you got personal. You, as a team of professionals trying to make money, got personal. You got personal and decided to insult your playbase, calling us "[censored]" and "[removed]". Not a wise move.

We won't forget this. You've set a new tone for the kind of interaction we'll be having with you. It's a cold one. One where there aren't any illusions about the reality of the situation. Previous notions of "family" are dead. We are mere consumers to you, and that is obvious.

You have chosen to bring in a new era of hostility and bitterness. Well done. Great PR move.
Honestly I think this is a good sign. If they‚Äôre not allowing people to delete their own accounts that means that there are enough people deleting the accounts to have an impact. I believe there‚Äôs more people hating Blizzard than it may seem. 

We should try pushing against them more and I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd cave.
what if you have no money in your account they are charging the subscription from?
The worst thing to happen to blizzard was Activision
Also break off from Activision. Blizzard went to shit when the two merged.
He fckd star wars Galaxy also, before coming to Blizzard.
Either that or buy black Blizzard from Activi$ion and go back to being private.

Why does everyone assume democracy is best? O_O it has never really worked in the Middle East, Latin America or China/Russia. Different countries can have differing ways of governing.

This is ten thousand percent a technical issue. Too many people trying to access the webpage overloading it.

The people posting these things is unfortunately are scaremongering (even if it's not done on purpose). People don't know what they're talking about -> see something negative -> their brain makes a leap of logic -> it happens to be the things that helps their case the most -> you get this.

Not saying you shouldn't delete your account if you want, but don't place such an idiotic level of evil on what is absolutely a technical issue.
The Donald should too. Democracy and the rule of law must be followed as set by the constitution and articles of impeachment.
Hot take I dont think this is brack.. (or maybe i at least don't want to think its brack haha). Blizzard weimo ( not 100% sure if thats what its called) account apologized to China and and said simething about their proud country. I'd like to think that these actions were all from the China subsidiaries that control Blizzard business but a lack of Brack's response or anything (other than 'regular' employees deleting their own wow subs and covering up the every voice matters) im most likely wrong. I Would also like to think pre-activison blizzard wouldnt have done this
Brack is a puppet. The big bois are pulling the real strings. "President" is literally a meaningless title.
Don't worry. This isn't true. Blizzard is not stopping folks from deleting accounts.
How so? He is getting Blizzard access to over a billion people in a country with a growing middle class and disposable income.
He might not have to resign, the board will remove him if this keeps up. They are going to take a huge financial hit, and it would be a PR nightmare if they did a mass firing like they did earlier this year to appease shareholders. Only makes sense to remove the CEO when he is responsible for the decline of a company.

Next step is to get investors to sell off shares of blizz, a smart investor would already be pulling out because they are going to be losing money after all this
What is the language you use to describe actual atrocities? Were you defending Rosanne Barr's freedom of speech with such fervour?
This is something that has always been done so that someone cant just delete an account with potentially hundreds or thousands of dollars in it. They have always required photo id for this kind of thing. If you want to unsub from wow you can easily.
China has a playerbase the size of the US population. Ofc they're going to try to stay on China's good side.
He probably has little to no say in what is going on I'm afraid. If we want to blame someone it's the upper big dogs.

Small indie company? They‚Äôre a publicly traded company.

Oh he's talking to lawyers.
Probably not in/from China.
i just have the same question.  Could I sue it if it does not allow me to delete my personal information.
> You can sue for that.

You can. But you'll probably lose. Blizzard Tournament ToS are so vague that they can exclude anyoneand recind prize money basically without giving any justification. That's a risk you take by participating in their tournaments.

People should stop doing it. But hey.
You can also sue for false allegations since this turned out to be a technical error.
Just call your bank and tell them charges to blizzard entertainment are no longer authorized.
I've seen people sue for less than this shit so no idea how you come to that conclusion.
Is this just an US thing? 

Im from EU and I just deleted my battle.net account in few minutes without any ID or issues.

Edit: I realized that blizzard might ask for my ID before the deletation is finalized. As of T+5 hours, after sending the ticket they havent asked anything. Finland btw
They need it to PROVE you own the email address.  Cuz you know, i can't just send them an email from that address.
They want it so they can pass the info on to China, for the official record of Hong Kong supporters.
Can someone help us delete our accounts without showing government ID? I really dont trust them with it.
So they can report you to China.
If you only have a government ID, and that is military, let them know it is literally against the law to reproduce it in any way.  No pictures, nothing, and them asking you to commit a felony is ridiculous.

They want to prove you're you.  MMO accounts getting hacked has been a problem for 20 years.  Prior to deleting things, they tend to verify you're you, because deletions are permanent for the most part.  Sony also asks for proof of identity for similar things in regards to Everquest
> THEY ARE ASKING FOR MY GOVERNMENT ID

All for the hate on activision blizzard, but they have asked for this since forever.

Not for everything, but from time to time. I remember I had to show my ID when I was claiming my account after it got stolen etc. 
Doesn't feel too far fetched that they'd ask you to prove it's you deleting your account. 

Rather have it like that than that anyone could delete your account if they got access.
I had to give them my ID when recovering my account after being hacked, this isn't a new thing, this was months back, and not related.
Blizzard has always asked for government ID for stuff like that. I had to show my ID to change the e-mail linked to my account.

This isn't new.
You know it is less about the ID specifically and more about the fact that someone who is up to no good would be less likely to hand over any information that would get them arrested if they were being malicious. Im sure people are taking advantage of the chaos and the locking accounts is alot less Blizzard is being bad and more consumer protection.
Perhaps your ID and photo get put into a "file" "somewhere". Don't ever try going to china, might be "detained" on "landing". Sketchy times
I was asked for mine when I had to remove my authenticator after I'd lost it and then again when I got locked out of my account many years ago. Sounds like something they do for big account changes.

It was still super uncomfortable sending them a photo of my passport... I really hate doing that.
They‚Äôre gonna hand over the ID info of anyone China wants.
If I were a sadist at blizzard I'd forward your government ID to the PRC to put you on an exit blacklist for going against the party by deleting your account.
They always asked for ID when it comes to account issues. They ask for OD, because you had to give them a name when you first created your account. They are just checking if the name on the ID and the name they got in their database matches up, thus proving it is your account.
Can someone ELI5, why do people need to delete the account instead of just stop using it or de-activate? I'm so confused by this and cant get an answer anywhere
To be fair if it didn‚Äôt require ID then it just require someone to hack your email and delete all your games/loot and that seems awful. They wan‚Äôt ID to prevent hackers from deleting peoples account
When I deleted my old account many years ago, I had to send a letter with a copy of passport. Had no idea you could ever delete an account digitally.
If they won‚Äôt let you cancel your account, you can dispute any charges from them with your bank/cc company and not pay them. Probably.
What is a government ID?
Because china needs your government id :)
This isn't new guys. It's to prevent you from accidentally loosing everything you've purchased digitally. Once it's gone it's gone. Your game licenses, card packs, skins, etc etc... You can easily stop your subscription without jumping through these hurdles.
hey you don't need an ID to vote for the president but you do to delete your blizzard account.  welcome to America.
* Yes, you can delete your account.
* Your ID has been required for quite some time. This is not new, and has nothing to do with China.

Today people are learning that deleting an account that is tied to money, purchases, digital ownership ("licensing" if you want to be anal about it) is made hard so that irreversible action isn't done accidentally or maliciously.
Try deleting your payment methods
I recovered a hacked account before and I needed to send them my ID. It's really not a big deal. They already have all your information and credit card numbers and any other information blizz collects off your accounts and devices. It's a security measure against people deleting your account against your will. 

Dont let blizz attempts to slow you down work. It's a tactic to save themselves.
I think it‚Äôs their standard practice to verify that it‚Äôs actually you requesting to delete your account. When my account got hacked I had to send them a picture of my ID for them to reset it for me.
Data mining for China.
theyve done this forever.  Its so that if you get hacked they literally cannot delete your account without confirming its you beyond a doubt.
I had this issue, I think they fixed their system now. I was FINALLY after three days, able to submit my deletion request.
Blizzard: Do you guys not have phones?
They did that back in 2017 too tho
With how deep they are in China's pocket that just sounds like they're asking you to dox yourself.
Can confirm - they want to see my ID to delete the account, despite me not providing my ID when I signed up.
If you submit it they will tell you that the account removal isn't applicable in your region. So you'll have sent them your i.d for nothing.
This is crazy how they want govt photo ID.  TO VERIFY THAT WE ACTUALLY OWN THE EMAIL ADDRESS??  Fuckin gotta be shittin me, i can send them an email BOOM PROOF!  They're farming faces for their database tryin to get something even from leavers.
This is all bullshit for sure, but Blizzard asks for photo ID when all other authentication fail. When I needed to transfer my authenticator to a new device and didn't have the old one anymore, I had to send my picture ID to them.
Although now they are using this as an obstacle to unsubscribe as oopose to the last layer of security.
Rings major alarm bells with me.
I got that too. Also, it is difficult to take a photo of your ass with a tablet, so I sent them a picture of a snorlax instead. Hopefully that'll do.
They always ask for ID. I contacted customer service a year ago and they wanted one just so i could submit a ticket.
Well duh.. that‚Äôs how they give your info to china so if you ever go there they know to send you to the organ harvesting facility.
[deleted]
Which has always been the case for action with high account security. Changed my email-address in 2006, had to submit my ID for obvious reasons. But I guess even in a time before Acti-Blizz they send everything to China. Logic is out the window.
to be fair that's just smart policy. imagine if someone got a hold of your account/computer and they just deleted thousands hours of your progress.
This is normal.  If somebody entered your account they could easily delete it without validation.  And Blizzard is legally required to WIPE every bit of data relating to your account if you do, so there is no do-overs.  The ID requirement is normal and SHOULD be in place.
This isn't a new thing, I had to give a picture of my driver's license when recovering my account after being hacked, this was 2/3 months ago.

Not related to the Hong Kong stuff at all.
If you enable sms auth you can use that. (just did that)
Yeah, that didn't go well for me. http://reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfn3yi/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/f34xd4v
If you're in the EU and have an account, hit them with data requests. Request your game data here: https://eu.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services

Doing this will put strain on them as they have to get all your data, check it, etc... Takes them up to 30 days per person.
Oh I'd send them a picture of myself... 

Too bad they failed to specify WHICH part of myself.
Yeah, couldn't delete as they want a government issued ID to delete my account to verify it's me. They have never had id off me before, how can they verify anything?
For UK Residents, you should write a letter using the ICO template  
[https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/raising-concerns/](https://ico.org.uk/your-data-matters/raising-concerns/)   
to this location:  
[https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z1095341](https://ico.org.uk/ESDWebPages/Entry/Z1095341) 

From there, if there is no response, then you can submit a complaint to the ICO about infringement of my data. Why do they need more personal data to delete your personal data? They don't.
They've had this method of authentication in place for quite some time. I had to use it once because of an issue I was having when I switched from the authenticator to the phone app, or vice versa. But when I went to delete my account I got denied immediately, when I tried using SMS or the authenticator. I'll gladly submit my photo ID to part ways with these fuckers [(and I did)](https://imgur.com/a/oHQYVV6). Certainly not afraid.
Which they've done for years.

Which other companies do too, when dealing with accounts tied to purchases and such, to prevent account compromises from resulting in your account being nuked by someone who took it over.

This is not new, but folks are running around like chickens with their heads cut off.
They've done this for years.
To the people saying or implying this is abnormal: They and many other companies have been doing this for years. I went through this several years ago with LinkedIn and more than 7 years ago with blizzard. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs the best method, or that it doesn‚Äôt put your identity at risk, I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs common. Thinking that it‚Äôs nefarious because it‚Äôs uncommon is wrong.
Photoshop the numbers to somthing. They don't have the means or legal grounds to even verify your Driver's license #

Please in the future be explicit, don‚Äôt be vague like that. These will likely be aggregated by a database search function, and your comment won‚Äôt be in the PowerPoint to execs under ‚Äúduck you cuz HK‚Äù bucket. Yeah you quit at the right time, but your message wasn‚Äôt heard and you‚Äôll be lumped under the ‚Äúother‚Äù bucket.

For people planning on canceling, be explicit not snarky
Cancelling sub and deleting account is not the same thing.
You'll be able to cancel your sub, buy full on deleting your account is a different issue right now.
That comment won't do shit because nobody is reading that. It's all about keywords. "FREE HONG KONG! REVOLUTION OF OUR TIME!" is what you should put in your message, that will register correctly in their database.
I canelled my subscription but it lasts until December so as a wow player I encourage people to get into their panda skins and protest that way.
* You can still cancel your subscription.
* Account deletion has not been disabled. A few people having trouble is not the same thing as "Blizzard is blocking everyone from deleting accounts."

Be at peace. You can still unsubscribe and delete your account. Don't fall into the conspiracy circlejerk.
Join us at /r/ffxiv instead.
I‚Äôm sorry but a video game company required your drivers license number? I‚Äôve apparently never created an account with them but that seems like an unnecessarily invasive piece of personal info for a video game company to have.
I got the same bullshit. I did my license, # redacted. The site threw an error. Then i got the ok, we got it, but you have  month to reconsider.
Exact same thing happened when I tried to delete my account yesterday right after the news broke... I'd only ever used it once for an Overwatch free weekend.
Literally same against thing happened to me
That's illegal in a lot of countries
Are we positive we didnt just crash it with traffic mass canceling? I just dont like to go off half cocked.
Do I hear the sound of a court case
Accept no half measures of mea culpas. Settle for nothing less than full cancelations and full refunds.
Wouldn‚Äôt you just stop payment from your bank? Or do a chargeback?
This isn't illegal in most of the US. Only CA has protections similar to the GDPR. If you live in any of the other states, you're fucked.
A class action lawsuit because you have to wait a few days to delete a free gaming account? Sheesh you guys lead the best lives.
You can also refute the charge through your credit card company and tell them the company refuses to cancel your account.
Ah true American way, sue every body for everything.
EA can get fucked too
This will be extremely hard for WoW players to do because that means losing up to or more than a decade of their life. It‚Äôs the right thing to do, but definitely hard.
I'm probably gonna get trounced for this but Blizz asking for govt ID is not some new thing.

My account is from 2006 and there have been a few instances over the years (ie. I moved countries and needed to change my address, or remove an authenticator) where I have been asked to send them a picture of my passport etc.

People being upset with Blizz is definitely understandable given what happened, but losing your heads over a layer of account security that has been in place for quite some time is just silly. Especially considering how rampant account hacking is.

*Edit - Cancelling your wow sub for example doesn't require ID. You just follow the steps.
The ID isn't for canceling a subscription. It's to close out your account permanently.
They already have your credit card information, billing address, email, and any other information they collect off your accounts, and they collect info off any device you use blizz products on too.

They already have all that information, an ID doesnt give them anything they dont already have on you.
Unfortunately they could (and probably will) still ask for your id before giving you the possibility to exercise your rights over your personal data (including the right to be forgotten).
Imma go full GDPR on their asses, it is part of my job to apply and uphold this EU direktive and I tell you it is not a toothless law. If Blizzard do not comply in a timely manner it will cost them dearly. I hope the US catches up and implement similar laws.
Do you have any sort of proof of your claim that it's "very likely" China will end up with your ID?
This is a good chant!
Oh, and then you throw the rock! Clever!
Activision.
Get banned. Log into any game you've got and spam chat with anti CCP messages.
no its not
It's common procedure to ask for ID to identify you for completely removing your data (removing all traces of all cd keys that you own, so they're lost forever).

Have fun wasting your time.
As I'm in the EU, please do tell me more
>You're going to harm those at the bottom first who have no control over this matter.

Who do you mean?
Of course that's what's happening. But for all cool kids on reddit, that wouldn't be as nice as a story that let's them show how morally superior they are than evil corporations, is it?
Pretty sure at least 90% will myself included
Eh
Yes, you are supposed to be able to delete your account the same way you made it. It can't be made harder to unsubscribe from something, then it is to subscribe to it.
Let me check that on my phone... /s
I am though ;)
Then why are they also denying account deletion when you do supply an ID?
I mean people are getting on this first try with correct info, it's not just one person I've seen over a thousand posts from different people in the past 24 hrs getting the same thing
I'm usually cynical about that stuff myself, but from the looks of this thread it's actually really happening to everyone trying to delete their account.
Ooook so why is there alot of people saying the same shit? You just suckint blizzards dick?
The comments in this thread suggest it‚Äôs happening to many people, even including government ID to verify authenticity. Seems odd.
I tried to delete my account for the first time yesterday with email code and got the same message even though I'd only ever used my account for one weekend during Lunar New Year.
It's very naive of you to think that china will stop affecting corporations in a couple of years.
Given that Tencent owns a majority of the company replacing the CEO isn't going to fix anything.
They've always had this security. As someone that's come back from holiday to hijacked accounts I'm glad they couldn't delete my purchases.
Don‚Äôt be blinded by the fiasco that is happening with China. This layer of protection have been around for a long time. This is to prevent someone who got your account details to easily delete away your licenses to your games, which may be worth quite a bit.
Activision happened.
At the risk of being labeled a shill.... never attribute malice to something that can be explained by incompetence.

This is ten thousand percent a technical issue. Too many people trying to access the webpage overloading it.

The people posting these things is unfortunately are scaremongering (even if it's not done on purpose). People don't know what they're talking about -> see something negative -> their brain makes a leap of logic -> it happens to be the things that helps their case the most -> you get this.

Not saying you shouldn't delete your account if you want, but don't place such an idiotic level of evil on what is absolutely a technical issue.
Since 2002 China has gone from a regional power, to a world-wide power house, solely because corporations needing to keep the beast that is capitalism fed sent nearly all our manufacturing there. Over the past 17 years+ it grew their economy into one of the largest in the world. Now that economy is being sought out by every corporation in the west to tap into on the consumer side to keep feeding the capitalism beast.  This means these companies are now beholden to Chinese interests and going to start pushing totalitarian policies back into the west. With the other Chinese censorship happening in the US this is the mask starting to come off.
It's called the junta, you just haven't given a reason to the police or military to intervene and restore order in favour of the oppressive regime and their corporations.
What are you talking about? You think you can easily delete a steam account and permanently wipe out every game you've ever purchased? No, they want to verify it's you. You can easily stop a subscription from Blizzard. You just click cancel subscription. But deleting everything game you've ever purchased is slightly harder and for good reason.
[removed]
Pretty much this. Also, if so many people are trying to use this feature, it might make sense that they'd lock it until things calm down. I'm not sure if something like this can only handle a certain amount of traffic.
[removed]
That's like saying Walmart should be allowed to lock you in the store until you buy something if you choose to stop shopping at Walmart !
Do you really believe what you're saying? I'm seriously asking.

Like, you think blizzard and it's employees have a stance, and if they have one, it's FOR the bad things happening in China?

You don't think they have the contractual obligation to apply the rules to their contracts, seeing as how they are one of the only companies the Chinese govt hand picks to sell their games? You think they wanted this? You think if they didn't China couldn't literally be just like "bye, lol" and half of blizz's marketshare wouldn't disappear overnight including thousands of jobs and millions over millions lost for its stockholders?

All of you people are only here to boost your egos, big talkers acting like you're so morally superior.

You're completely ignorant to what actually is going on and you're not doing shit but being sheeps trying to look cool.

It's pathetic and sad.
ok bootlicker
Do you have a link to the tweet?
Because I trust Blizzards PR when their Chinese Weibo account basically said we dont support free speech, long live China; After telling the west, :we support free speech" after banning a player for speaking his opinion.
they posted nothing on twitter.
If you are ignorant of the atrocities before and then learned of it  and took appropriate action, that's not exactly bandwagoning.
So basically all forms of social change are invalid? Go back to r/sino, you shill.
That's because people didn't understand what China was. Now they do.
What has understanding something to do with caring about something.

Ofcourse there is a hatetrain and thats a good thing, things rarely change without a revolution even if it is a "soft" one.

But i wonder..don't you care about anything in our world?
you stupid man
Here's your 3.50 in social credit, shill.
‚ÄúYeah people care for this issue, but they are not caring for it PROPERLY. An American private company issues massive, sweeping punishments motivated by a totalitarian regime‚Äôs requirements and suddenly everyone gets their panties in a twist!‚Äù
You got the Big dumb
From what I‚Äôve heard the winner of one of their tournaments was from Hong Kong. When he was interviewed he gave his support for the riots

Blizzard then took the win and the cash prize (thousand something or other) off of him and banned him from playing professionally for a year all because he said 8 words. Now they‚Äôre going into full damage control to try and keep people from boycotting them
Attention
Just tried, they're manually reviewing the IDs too now.
Edit: My request got rejected
It‚Äôs appreciative when ppl take some time to think first rather than start flinging shit immediately. These sensitive situations are easy times for misinformation to go around and have your emotions taken advantage of.
I see a thread on Blizzard's EU forums going as far back as 2012 inquiring as to why a photo ID is necessary to open a support ticket. This is just on a cursory glance at Google results. I am not sure when they implemented the policy, but it does not appear to be in response to this recent backlash.  [https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/d3/topic/5848116640](https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/d3/topic/5848116640) 

&#x200B;

Still think Blizzard sucks.
Personally blizzard has required my Id back in BC/WotLK to confirm it was me when I was hacked so I know it‚Äôs been their policy for major account things in the past. Doesn‚Äôt seem new tbh.
I wonder if they‚Äôre up from when I bought or down

Hong Kong Hearthstone player Blitzchung was banned from the Hearthstone Grandmasters, had the prize money he already won rescinded, and suspended for a year after saying, ‚ÄúLiberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our age.‚Äù During an interview. The two casters who were conducting the interview were also fired.
They banned a chinese hearthstone player and stole all of his winnings, because during his interview, he said he wanted to raise awareness for freedom of speech in china.
You just gave me the best idea for a costume for Blizzcon. Thanks!
By cancellimg your CC, you're just deleting your payment method. Your account would still exist.
You can tell the credit card issuer that they aren't letting you cancel and to disallow future payments.
This actually sounds like a win-win idea, get your account banned or destroy their games.
They won't though because at this point they are way past caring about laws
Before you get downvotes up your butt, I stand with you on that. Blizz was fucked either way cause some edgy teen couldn t pick the right channel for his (legitimate) appeals.
Yes. Now crawl back into your hole.
Can Americans make a GDPR request?
Because everyone wants attention. Lmao
"it's not about the money it's about sending a message"
A pro Hearthstone player spoke up in support of the Hong Kong protestors and Blizzard banned him for a year, denied him his winnings, and also fired two commentators who happened to be covering his game at the time.
Genocide is great! We welcome our Chinese censors in our homes and hearts.
Imagine being this ignorant
Then wtf did they fire 2 casters that did nothing wrong? That move sparked this shit, not the previous.

Do their "All voices matter" shit still there?
A pro Hearthstone player spoke up in support of the Hong Kong protestors and Blizzard banned him for a year, denied him his winnings, and also fired two commentators who happened to be covering his game at the time.
If it fits their agendas, nothing else matters

Lol. This is not plausible in any way shape or form. Trying to defend it is stupid and ignorant.
this actually makes a lot of sense, but at the same time, what would a hacker gain from deleting someone's account?
If you or someone knows what's stopping them or any company from sending you only information that would want to send you
You mean EU? Yes, it's illegal.
I'm in So Cal and I'm planning to show up with a sign.
Even the method with photo ID is blocked. ALL methods.
And now my support tickets are all gone? i might have to go GDPR on these bitches

Not for Americans. Only European/EU citizens fall under this right. And than you may have to send an email or letter to get them your account deleted. I think they don't have to have an online functionality for this.
I don‚Äôt think you understand how pirating a game works....
https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/individual-rights/right-to-erasure/
This needs to be stickied
It is in Europe
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs going to be a lot of people that believe this is true without reading anything past a headline.
As a EU citizen, I was just in on my account trying at first to request my personal information, and later delete my account, so this is fresh: You can request that they delete your account, however, they request that you submit a picture of your ID-card. Which is overkill, from my point of view. So if you don't trust how they handle your data, you have to submit even more, sensitive, data?
Yeah, that seems like a rational statement..
LOL
So you have commented six times. Yet never bothered to read about what you are commenting on?
Essentially Blizzard banned a Hearthstone tournament champion for saying "liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age", fired the two casters interviewing him and their Chinese branch made a public apology saying they'd uphold China's honor or something.
[I did.](https://i.imgur.com/XbwBEEC.jpg)  And I'm hardly alone.
It's true.  After talking to them on the phone I had to submit a ticket with a picture of my ID to get my deletion processed.
BBB is basically Yelp before Yelp.  They only have an authoritative sounding name because they have the word "Bureau" in their name.  They even say it themselves: "Although we greatly help consumers and businesses through information and business self-regulation,¬†we are not a government agency, nor do we have law enforcement powers. "
You don't have to report anything, your bank will block anyone on request
Yes it is I‚Äôm dealing with that issue right now. They are not letting me delete my account. They have demanded that I provide a picture of my drivers license that I never even gave them to begin with. They originally said when I was going through that I have the option to choose how we want to be verified to delete our account and then once I got to the area where you could choose it said the only option I had was a legal ID.
Don‚Äôt do it they‚Äôll demand your drivers license just so that you can delete your account
lol as if our president gives a shit he‚Äôs backing china too
DELETE the account, not UNSUBBING
Hearthstone pro expressed support for Hong Kong protest after winning a tournament.  Was banned for a year and had his winnings rescinded.  The two casters working the stream at the time were also fired.  The VOD was deleted.  And now they're actively obstructing peoples ability to delete their accounts while simultaneously banning people that have changed their battletag to things resembling "FreeHongKong"

And Blizzard supposedly apologized to China instead of Hong Kong.  I say supposedly as I haven't read any reputable articles yet (haven't done a big search either though.  Relax!)

That about sums it up I think?
As a developer who writes software and websites that must comply with GDPR: Yes, it's illegal.
That's how an ideal state is made bro.
You sacrifice small things that go against YOUR morality
It never went away
Thanks, Luke.
Wow died with the release of Cata, lets be real.
If done illegitimately this will have consequences for the card owner. Think carefully about this..
Only the smartest people start their arguments by calling the other side idiots. Always gets the intelligent ball rolling..
Why did the interviewers got fired? They didn't ask about his political views
When Blizzard decided to punish someone for freely expressing their thoughts ‚Äî a democratic virtue ‚Äî Blizzard *made* it political. They sided with authoritarians and murderers. They rejected free expression, and elevated totalitarianism.

That is political.
Cracker? Did you mean crackhead?
A heartstone pro player said smth pro HK, they banned him and the casters leading his interview. ANd now reddit is angry :D
Wow, such a warrior
You can process the account deletion if you use the option right below the 4 buttons to submit a ticket with a picture of your ID.
BBB isn't a government organization, that's a common misconception.  They are entirely commercial.
That's because they didn't
Get a grip, the OP was mistaken
Yes
Get you shit together. Blizzard and many companies have required photo I'd for stuff like this since forever.
Ahead of the curve. All their games made after D2 LOD have been trash Nyway.
For many people,  this is the first time they have heard about what's going on in China now.  Blizzard is trying (badly) to limit how many people learn about it.  I'd say that's a pretty big affect on people's lives
$50. . . for. . . for a *virtual* ticket?
Don't forget the pro-ccp who might show up. They showed up to many pro HK rallies in other countries and even threatened the gay pride parade in canada.
Waitwhat? People pay $200 for Blizzcon????
> I think they've invested too much into the event to really pull out.

Right on. The event is less than 4 weeks away with 10-thousands of estimated visitors. A lot of Blizzard employees will be there. Hotels and Flights are booked. Venue is being prepared.

They won't pull out. They'll just weather the storm. In 3-4 months, people will have forgotten. And they can work with the dip in subscribers and accounts.

Sucks, but that's what's gonna happen.
Mh full denial if I'd guess. Blizzcon is first and foremost a marketing thing. They want to announce and hype their new stuff and probably want to avoid anything else at all cost.

Camera is mostly fixated on the stage and doesn't show the audience, abandoning QAs is probably too obvious but either pre-recorded or at least set questions that come with overblown counteractions if someone goes off the script. People with obvious political messages get a warning/thrown out and the signs removed etc.

Honestly, I don't even think they'll do a lot different than the years before. If they have open QAs with scripted question it's up to the people if they want to sacrifice their stay and probably blizz account to shout out pro HK support. It anyway will be more fun to watch this year.
It doesn't matter to them, they'll be insured on most things. It's the regular people who'll lose out
Security won't let people get through and there will be no open Q&A section. You'll probably see some HK flags in the public that will be promptly invited to leave and that's it.
Not show it in China?  Pretty easy for them.
The guards will take care of them really fast, that's nothing to worry about for Blizzard
>I'm really curious what they're going to do.

Pretty simple really:
"No political messaging or symbols permitted inside the Blizzcon event space. Anyone found to be displaying messaging on signs, symbols or their clothing, will be asked to leave, and their tickets revoked. All patrons are subject to search upon entry."

It's a private event, they can do what they want. They don't give a crap about the stink being caused right now over this issue, you think they'll care what a few Americans add to the already saturated hate-train online?
I'll take anyones ticket they dont want I just want games and stuff
A million bucks is nothing to them. Just a simple suckle of CHina's tip will give them twice that.
If it was canceled, they'd already be out of pocket after refunds. Caterers, security, the venue, etc. all have deposits. I helped put together an event last year at a 20K cap venue in California, and all the money was due up front and non refundable to an extent. 

They will lose at least $400-600k if this event is cancelled in a venue that size. Lots of moving parts that require payment up front. 

However, they'd probably sooner cancel than deal with red shirts.
*$50?!* I can buy nice food for that!!
I will be cosplaying at Blizzcon this year. I had my cosplay done a few weeks ago, I am starting some revisions to accommodate some pro HK elements
Wait, virtual ticket? Is that like how people use their phone as a bus pass? Or are people paying to stream a convention at $50 a pop?

OK, I googled it to not be a moron, it's pretty much exactly what I thought it was. Gross.
The Chinese branch of Blizzard called China,"our country". It doesn't make it any less shitty, just pointing it out.
Where can i find that apology, i would really like to read it
They're essentially a zombie-company. "Money! Money! Need money!" No regard for human life, dignity, self-respect, etc... To hell with them.
> They might as well move to China and sell their shitty games over there for all I care.

This is exactly how I feel.  You want the Chinese market so bad?  Fine.  Go have it.  GTFO
Where's  Joseph McCarthy when we need one?
Just pointing out that the actual text does not say "our country", it says "ÂõΩÂÆ∂" which means "country". Because of how tightly coupled the Chinese language is with China, "country" by default means "China". Inserting "our" is one way to translate this but it may give an incorrect connotation.
Here‚Äôs the thing though.. companies that ‚Äúcare‚Äù about human rights and doing the right thing only do so for brownie points and to look good to their customer base.. that‚Äôs literally how it works.
cause we dont want to become the very thing we fight against
Yes sir. Amen
Agreed.  Tariffs do not work.

Just bar entry to the market.  And make extra sure that Blizzard pays every thin red dime they owe in taxes, and then some.
**Donald Trump entered the chat**
This is a bit beyond reddit. You even have democrats and republicans agreeing and calling out Blizzard for bending over backwards to suck on the chinese teet.
They wont even let you in most likely if you bring anything related to HK.
Only if the games are heavily censored and they all pledge aliance to china and the party.
But I‚Äôve already sharpened my pitch fork!
If the China fiasco wasn't happening there wouldn't be a single person whining about the ID-required thing, and this person's tweet would not have gone viral.

But "confirmation bias is a fallacy" goes out the window when you're preaching to a circlejerk.

I had 2 accounts that I deleted last night, both accounts gave me an error for the other authentication methods, so some people were upset it was an obvious tactic to slow people down. I think the people saying "I wont send them my ID" are just using that as an excuse to not delete their accounts, and is exactly what blizz is hoping for. 

Either way they are going to have a lot of explaining to do to their share holders. Remeber when they fired 800+ people earlier this year because they didnt meet their expected growth? That was to appease share holders. 

Now theyve had so many people deleting and unsubbing they are taking measure to slow it down. People need to keep this up, it's working.
>Completely terminating an account to oblivion is not something companies will do.

They will have to for their EU customers. GDPR law and such.
>Don't forget to also explain how Blizzard isn't actually preventing account deletion in the first place.

I agree. At the time I know *some* people were having this problem. I just didn't want to dump any fuel on that fire.
I think lots of people didn't even know you could actually delete your battle.net account and scour it from the face of the earth.
I know, and that's dicked up, but AFAIK it's not actually disabled. I've seen plenty of screenshots of people successfully doing it.

Not sure why some people are having issues and some aren't. I didn't really want to get into he said/she said stuff though.
Well they certainly want your organs, not sure if they're after your face yet.
>I have my battlenet account with only 5‚Ç¨ on it, i don't have any games there(since Destiny migrated thankfully), so why should I share my photo ID?

Probably because the CS goon that's going to delete your account needs it to have permission to do it.

>My identification document is worth more than sending it to a company in which I have no trust to hold that information secure.

Then don't. IIRC you can tell them to lock the account if you want.
No, it doesn't.
Let's let the lawyers handle the legal stuff. Just handle your own affairs with the systems in place for now. We can obfuscate the actual message with internet lawyerings later... or never. I'd prefer never.
Chances are their server/customer support is overloaded. 

They never planned for so many people to cancel everything so the systems set up can't handle it.

There doesn't need to be some grand conspiracy like blizzard preventing people from leaving.
not got my notification yet either after going through the process.
Oh no, an ICO complaint! What shall they do?
Do you guys not have basic human rights?
As a previous hearthstone competitive player I am disgusted with Blizzard that they singled out a player and destroyed their career. I hope Chung ‚ÄúBlitzchung‚Äù Ng Wai has a bright future and this sets an example for the rights of professional e-sports players in the future.
J. Allen Brack knows you want to say "basic shareholders rights "
Xi has always said that what we in the Western world consider "human rights" is of no interest to them. "It doesnt work in China".

Activision, known tax evaders and purveyors of casinos for children, would never be so unethical! /s
Well he does have that look to him.
Whew boy
No shit.
Hey SidAlpha is a great guy. Someone get the guy in here!
Let remember what Blizzard is at it's core.

It's a distraction and time sink. It's the digital circus in Bread and Circus's.

*anem et digitalis circenses* 

It's an opiate fro the masses.
Was this from the EA BF2 fiasco? Or the one with Respawn‚Äôs Apex Legends heirlooms and lootboxes?
anyone who thinks a company views them as anything other than "mere consumers" is either an idiot or incredibly deluded.
r/apexlegends is leaking
Others are saying this is a copy+pasta from some EA fiasco - do you know the original source? Would love to know what it was originally replying to
It was a great PR move. The vast majority of there players will not care\*, and it gives them access to well over a billion people in a country with a rising middle class and disposable income.

Not exactly - deleting an account doesn't mean your details aren't on record any more. If you want to GDPR them, actually hit them with a request to have your personal data deleted as per GDPR. THEN, if they don't do it, they're breaching the regulations.

In addition, this is more work for them than letting you delete your account.
I did actually

Username checks out
He, legally speaking, violated the rules he agreed too. Not saying he can't win a lawsuit just that it isn't open-close
Not sure you understand what defamation is, but they didn't say or do anything to damage his character or reputation. If anything it's been grossly enhanced since this happened.
Using another company's platform to push a political agenda is still a risky thing to do. He deserves a punishment for it and I don't think he himself disagrees (he probably knew there would be consequences), but the punishment he got was too harsh. A fine would have been way more suitable. The loss of prize money is trickier because it clearly states in blizzards ToS that violating the rules will result in no prize money, and he did violated the rules.

Edit: word
You can sue for someone not allowing you to cancel a subscription. Best case you only get back the money they took since you first tried to cancel. Better yet, tell your bank to deny any future charges to blizzard.
In Europe you absolutely can seek legal action in accordance with GDPR.
He said you CAN sue...
In Europe the deletion of an account must be easy, otherwise the company get get fined 20 million euros, or 2% of their entire global revenue, whichever is higher. If it was on purpose, the amounts double.
People will sue over anything, that shit comment you came up with had no purpose from the beginning
Nice dyslexia
So you can sue but it's weird to think of that? Idk where is your standing on this it makes no sense
I think it is illegal in EU to make the cancel process too hard to complete.
I'm sure they won't do the same in the EU because of GDPR. If they stored data about you without you consent, they could be fined 2 % of their yearly revenue.
Need my ID and I'm from New Zealand.
German here, have the same issue as op. Can't delete my account without ID. Reopened the ticket again and stated that an ID was not needed when I created the account.
No, and this is nothing new as well. I had to show my ID years ago because I lost access to my authenticator. 

Reddits hivemind is at it again.
I'm in the US and I was able to delete without providing an ID. I tried it a few times over the past few days. Was finally able to do it an hour or so ago. Prior to that every time I tried I got the too many attempts message.
In the EU they ask for your ID as well, at least I just had to provide it
Deleted my account from the netherlands and they did ask for ID, I included it but blocked my face and any information they didn't have already
Europe has a law that is called ‚ÄòThe right to be forgotten‚Äô
companies must delete all your data if you ask for it.
how did you do that? i am from EU and they are asking me for an ID.
How will my ID prove I own blizzardsuckspoohdick@gofuckyourself.com?
Why would that even prove it's your email address? You don't use an ID to sign up for emails either. This reeks of fuckery.
someone with logic
I don't think there is a way at this time.
I blacked out everything besides my name, birth date and parts of my face. Hopefully it's going to work, should be enough for them.
I've seen some people use text verification instead of an ID to delete, but I only had the option of sending an ID. I sent in a customer support ticket asking for the text option, and in order to send the ticket, they asked for my ID...
They are gonna send them to china so you get put on the list!~
Take an image of it, fake the numbers but not birthday..

Reading that law, it's not just military IDs it covers, but any government issued ID?
I'm all aboard the Blizzard (rightful) hatetrain, and I find it ridiculous that people don't grasp why Blizzard wants a form of ID. It almost certainly has to do with not allowing the perma-deletion of an account by whoever is able to "prove" they own the email address. While I'm certainly no email guru, I do know that email spoofery is certainly within the realms of possibility.
No. Just no. Thats what the 30 day failsafe is for. Government ID is not required under any reasonable circumstance for a gaming account.
For changing account info it makes sense to slow down account hijackers, but for deleting an account? It seems like they should instead put it on a 30 day timer and send out emails reminding you that your account will be deleted.
Maybe to proof their boycutting? Personally I only have a blizzard account because i played 1 game of hearthstone. I don‚Äôt even remember my username. But I don‚Äôt get why people with tousands of hours and money on their account would delete it...
There is a difference between an inactive account and deleting your account.
I have 2 factor auth on.

That should be enough.
Drivers licence, passport, ID card, etc
You think you are joking but China is actually requiring its citizens to submit to facial recognition to access the internet  ([https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/chinese-citizens-will-be-required-scan-their-faces-use-internet](https://www.zerohedge.com/geopolitical/chinese-citizens-will-be-required-scan-their-faces-use-internet)) 

&#x200B;

With this kind of behavior since this censorship fiasco began, one would think Blizz is actually a Chinese company for real.
To be fair, blizzard most likely has that info already.
Dont be stupid, if someone had stolen his account and was requesting it be deleted giving over an ID would give them someone to prosecute in the event it was actually stolen.
Blizzard has always had a hard-on for seeing photographic ID. That was the case 15 years ago, as well. VERY common support request.
Calm down I get all the hatr but I started up again last month before all this and they asked the same thing
In the convo of the original tweet above, there are people saying they submit their ID and get rejected because it's "illegible" or not a "valid government-issued ID card."
Yep, that's Blizzard. They did this to me too.
Yeah, that's a violation of consumer rights in the EU and possibly a GDPR violation.
They can't make deleting an account harder than making one.
yep and my blizz account doesnt even have a real name on it so what good is ID going to do
To be fair, and I don't want to be, when I had to regain access to my old account because I had forgotten all the info they requested a picture ID then as well.
Just send them the blizzard ccp flag that's been going around
wonder if they keep it afterwords, then they get to be hacked and pay everyone for credit monitoring service
It isn't nothing for them, of course.
are you serious?
> i can send them an email BOOM PROOF!

Ha, no. It's stupid easy to fake the From: address of an email message. That's why every site that does email validation does it by sending you something (which usually has a link you click on so even the "reply" path is through the browser instead of email) rather than asking you to send them something.

(It's still ludicrous to ask for this level of verification now when they didn't require it for you to sign up.)
They aren't doing this for subscriptions. They are doing this for *deleting your entire account, including games you own the license to.* You do this, you have to re-buy anything you ever bought from Blizzard if you come back.

Whether or not it's heavy handed is up for debate, but I personally don't have a problem with it.
Uh... That didn't happen to me. I answered a few questions to confirm my identity and that I owned the account and they took care of it.

Might've changed but eh. Also is it necessary to require a photo ID for that anyway? Usually the way I end up with a new phone is because my old one broke and EA has always reset my SWTOR security key with roughly the same procedure except I have to literally call CS on the phone (which actually annoys the hell out of me but whatever lol) arenanet wants the same but they take a goddamn week to respond to emails that aren't direct from a logged in account.

Edit: to be clear I'm talking about the authenticator removal, not account deletion.
I sent Facebook an image of the NSA PRISM logo once instead of a picture of an ID after the account was blocked due to issues with their onion url, and my account at the time was subsequently unblocked. I still laugh about it.
i remember being worried that sc2 initially needed south korean SSID numbers for SK citizens to sign up for an account, this is so much worse...
Lol they already have all our info. You know many times dats breaches occurred just a regular stores?
>I can't access my original account as I used a fake name since I set the battlenet account up when I was 16 and didn't want to use my real name, so I send ID and nope doesn't match account details  >. >

They need an ID for this, too
In Fact, I can't even submit a ticket for a bug without ID verification
100% incorrect. They use e-verify, a government program used by employers to verify DL records. And they have legal grounds through you clicking "I have agreed to the terms and conditions stated above." However many years ago you opened a Blizzard account. After all, each year you got an email alerting you the terms and conditions of your account were updated, and you took no action.

Think that's an unfair use of terms of service agreement? Good luck fighting Activision lawyers!
That‚Äôs a waste of time as it will just be declined. They want ID to prevent hackers from deleting peoples accounts
I worked on cancelled accounts for Blizzard. Do exactly this. I was doing account review at the release of Skyrim and so many reports where for Skyrim others said the new game coming out but didn't get counted for Skyrim.
Autocorrect with the ducks again
You are absolutely right but the word is aggregated not aggravated.
Lol I just put ‚ÄúChina‚Äù
They're not gonna go over the specific reasons why all of a sudden a giant amount of their subsribers cancelled their subscription, they all know exactly why.
How else would ~~China~~ *Blizzard* know who you are to ~~definitely~~ *totally not* track you outside of the games?
I had to send a picture ID to override 2 factor authentication from someone who got into my account once.

Keep in mind this is for *deleting* your account, permanently. That means all the games you own, your entire history is deleted.

I don't think it's unnecessary honestly, it's potentially thousands of dollars worth of (admittedly digital) goods you're throwing away. They are making damn sure you want to delete that before going through with it and making damn sure it's actually you trying to do it.
Agreed, especially to delete an account.
A friend's account got hacked or banned or something, a little fuzzy on the details as this was ~10 years ago, then Blizzard required a copy of the account holder's drivers license to verify his identity. First time hearing about it for deleting your account though
They want to verify that the account being deleted is being deleted by the actual person who owns it.  It's not uncommon over the past 20 years for people to hijack other people's accounts, sell their shit, and delete the characters/accounts.  Sony has asked me before for similar documentation when I wanted to reopen an Everquest account that I no longer had access to the email for.  They don't want to give out access without some proof, and that is commendable
They started putting up insane authentication methods after years of peoples accounts getting hacked and looted.  I remember getting mine hacked once or twice before the authenticator came out...  they sold them on keychains
Yeah, as a developer I can confirm "Show us your government ID" is a typical error message when you have connectivity issues.

Some of you have probably recently seen the 'Where's your birth certificate mate?" and "Did you pack this suitcase yourself?" errors when Destiny 2 went on steam, for example.
Yeah, it‚Äôs also fixed already
This has been Blizzard CS's official response on Twitter about the cancelation thing.
Get out of here with your rational thinking, this is Reddit.
Dun dun
They aren't stopping your ability to unsub, they are stopping your ability to actually delete your account and all your info/games.
The issue isn't canceling your subscriptions.  The issue is canceling your account.
That's a false narrative introduced to the public by a few major corporations after that old woman burned herself at McDonald's. The coffee was routinely kept at at least 150 over the normal, safe temperature; it was handled poorly, and she suffered third degree burns over a large portion of her body and had to be hospitalized for months out of it. She sued for lawful negligence in training and running operations in that store, and won; the rumors and press about Americans and America and general being prone to quick and easy lawsuits was actually something taken up by a lot of anti-legislation PR groups and a general section of the populace fooled into believing that she was just a careless woman who wanted easy money out of a big company.

That woman nearly died from her injuries, and her lawsuit started off as only about her medical bills and became more at the insistence of her lawyer when McDonald's spend so much time and effort trying to dirty her bad name and shut her lawsuit down even then, and the changes that many major companies have made to their procedures since then have kept countless people from suffering the same fate and helped to keep big companies accountable in situations where they are proven to have been negligent in employee and customer safety.

But yeah, let's ignore that and just fall back on American stereotypes.
Unfortunately, our government doesn't protect consumers, so lawsuits end up being the only way bad companies ever get punished.

It's definitely not ideal.

Yes, the lawyers get way too much of the money.

But it seems to be the only way bad companies ever get punished.
Yea such a terrible system of solving civil disputes in ... you guessed it ... a CIVILised manner.
Right?  All these simps relying on their rights under the law instead of utilizing the previous method of just settling disagreements with violence.  /s
Money is the only thing Blizzard seems to understand, so hit 'em where it hurts.
At least EA is one of the few to have openly admited that they won't take any stance in China's favor. 

How times have changes.
2019 has been the year of game companies trying to one up each other on who can be the most evil
Yeah bitch, your next EA!
Ignoring all other facets of this. I think asking ID for ensuring the person DELETING an account, as in forfeiting all rights, is the owner of said account, is totally sensible.
this.  They can literally do credit inquries etc to get everything else they need on you if they were so inclined.  Kind of the world we live in now
The Right to be Forgotten doesn‚Äôt need you to dox yourself to uh, remove the dox worthy info
Look up how the 'right to be forgotten' in the GDRP works.
And I just agree
Right at poo bear. Brilliant
It's not common procedure.  It's a violation of EU data protection and online privacy laws.  A privately owned company can ask for your ID card but you are never obliged to do so.  Only proper authorities can demand this.
It's worth looking up the gdpr act as there is a lot that it covers and some of it seems pretty intensive

I suggest looking at recital no.65 as it covers this as best as I can find
Just [send them this](https://shipyourenemiesgdpr.com/) in an email to dpo@blizzard.com instead of deleting your account. You can always delete your account after they've responded to your GDPR request.

It's probably much more expensive for them than just canceling your account.

The linked website generates a gdpr request that is designed to waste as much of their time as possible by being incredibly detailed. It asks for literally everything you can ask for under the GDPR. They probably won't even have automation in place to deal with such detailed requests, which means their legal team will have to spend tons of time dealing with each and every single request.
What does that even mean?
Is there any actual evidence of that?
Doesn‚Äôt that mean there‚Äôs a reasonable chance you forgot your password or mistyped it, given how you barely used it? Not shilling; I just know I‚Äôm bound to forget my passwords, especially if I don‚Äôt know if they req‚Äôd a number or special character. Because I don‚Äôt use the same pw for everything.
The situation's not great, but unless they've managed to hide information from every investor out there, Tencent own around about 5% of Activision Blizzard.

It's enough of a clusterfuck without adding misinformation to the mix.
Since when is 5% a majority?
I‚Äôm just saying in general, I think it‚Äôs a tad extreme to jump right to deleting your account outright. I wouldn‚Äôt delete anything I put a ton of manhours and money into. Yeah what they did was fucked up, and I did unsubscribe to wow and uninstall. But I am not going to delete something I‚Äôve spent time on for the better part of 15 years.
Majority? Do your research you echo chamber fuckwit.
The irony of this is that everyone I've known who've had their accounts hacked, it was always hacked by someone from China. The one time they tried to hack mine it was Chinese (they were not successful).

All of their protections are in place to stop player accounts from being hacked by the same people Blizzard is best friends with now.
I tried all methods, sms, authenticator, even sent the picture ID, all gave me error messages. I tried again just now, got through but now it just says not available in my country. I still have my account. I dont want it.
Activision invalidated a license of a game I bought because something kept triggering their anti-cheat even though I had a clean install. they said I was pirating the game even though I got it from gamestop, wrapped, and they invalidated my key. Couldnt even return the damn thing either. Gave them a second chance with overwatch..

Then this happened. They're scumbags, and with the whole merger, activision is still daddy in that relationship.

"Illegal" 
Ok bud.
Your analogy is wrong. 

You can walk away from your computer. You can cancel your subscription. And when things calm down and you've cleared your mind, you can choose to cancel your account. You're being irrational and making hasty decisions that you may regret. 

Calm down, grab your pacifier, and cool off. If you're still an angsty dork that wants to delete your account after 72 hours, the option will be there.
You seem to be suggesting that it was morally acceptable to get into bed with an oppressive regime in the first place. It wasn't. I happen to run a small business that manufactures all of our goods in the USA. All our competition manufactures in china and india. They were happy to do so, regardless of the conditions people are subjected to, regardless of the human rights violations, regardless of anything, because it meant more profit in the short term.

Blizzard is no different. They knew who they were getting into bed with. This shit in china is coming to a boil now, but it's not like this started yesterday. The country has been oppressing, mistreating and abusing it's people for generations. I have -no- sympathy, but for the people who are suffering under those conditions.
Was days ago but it was also posted and then reposted in the subreddit too
Thats owned by Tencent not Blizzard thats not an official statement. 


Official Statement will be posted in English on their main account.


The orginal post that shared this has been tagged for being misleading.
it's kinda funny people didn't get this mad about china harvesting organs from people but are riled up by Hong Kong and HS pro player losing his winnings.  


I mean it's good, something had to trigger it, but comparing it next to each other...it's just sad.
They used XDDD in their comment. Obviously it's an edgy 15 year old getting into r/iamverysmart territory
I know they pull some shady shit that‚Äôs why I ask cause I was thinking of buying their stock
But they're not really doing anything for people.  Their only statement was that groveling about the pride of the Chinese Communist state or something.
They also fired the two interviewers on the spot that "let it happen"
Just like they have always been. This is a safety layer to prevent hackers from easily deleting your licenses for games that costs you money.
Yeah seriously.  The main topic has been upvoted 24k times now, and this once.  Guess it's all about the mob. I'll go find my pitch fork now.
Then seems like a lot of drama. I wouldn't want someone to delete my account without my authorization either. Inconvenient but it's not like they are doing it to desperately hold on to users.
Probably up
*Hong Kong, specifically, which has had pro-democracy/pro-independence riots going on for 4.5 months at this point.
They banned a *Hong Kong heartstone player and stole his $10 000 prize winnings, and banned him for 12 months, because *he supported the protesters in Hong Kong in the stream after he won.
Send me a pic when it's done!
You don't need to give an ID to cancel payments just to delete the account entirely
GDPR violations result in fines.
Every GDPR violation is a fine equal to 2% of their revenue. That's big
I didn't say I agreed with anything that happened. I'm just saying, he knew what he was doing. Blizzard didn't pull it because of what he said, they pulled it because it was political and breaks their rules. An American player who discuss Trump in an interview would get the same treatment. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è He knew he was gonna get in trouble and he decided the risk was worth the reward. If they let one person get away with being political, they have to let everyone.
He broke their rules. He acknowledged that he expected to be punished for his actions. He accepted his punishment. It's an esports tourney, not a political stage. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I have hardly seen any posts calling for those casters to get their jobs back. The main focus I have seen is on the player who lost his earnings for breaking the tournament rules. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è You people are literally punishing a company for enforcing rules that man agreed to when he entered the tournament.
No, that move didn‚Äôt spark anything. I barely see anyone talking about the 2 casters.
Oh. Well that is literally the worst thing they could have done. 

Thanks for taking the time to explain.
It's essentially just a security check to attempt to prevent accounts from being repossessed.

I'm all for disliking Blizzards current actions, but using a security system that has been there for months, if not years, seems silly.
seems a bit overkill tbh...
You clearly dont understand and that is fine I dont expect you to understand the laws and regulations on costumer protections, but a company that is in the spotlight and being scrutinized this much is covering their own ass at this point and if anything else happened like a mass hacking and deletion of accounts it would be their fault and they would suffer immensely both financially and publicly. I'm sure Blizzard is having a hard enough time choking on one shit sandwich, they would rather not eat another.
It happens every day I wont presume to guess but people are just dicks.
A personal enemy who knows that this can hurt the individual? A very disgruntled ex lover? There are many ways people can gain from it.
I'm referring to the fact that people are acting like they're trying to get your ID for malicious reasons, that's all. It's possible their servers are overloaded. I saw someone above say hours ago that it was fixed.
Oh yeah, I'm not saying it would apply to Americans. I was being totally selfish and trying to see a way of complaint that got around this whole ID thing for me (and potentially other Europeans).
?
I‚Äôm still confused tbh
Thanks, I was truly curious to what would happen with that customer group. Awesome of you to speak with you Dollar. Its the only thing people listen for..
Well yeah but that's been a thing for years. That's not disabling account deactivation. That's just a security policy that's been in place for a very long time
Yeah i get that, but its still just another hassle for them. If there is a flood of complaints its just a massive headache for them. If we all storm the complaints section they cant respond to us all. Sure, the BBB cant really do anything, but a bad business rating still looks bad. 

" Everything you submit will be forwarded to the business within two business days. The business will be asked to respond within 14 days, and if a response is not received, a second request will be made. You will be notified of the business‚Äôs response when we receive it (or you will be notified that we received no response). Complaints are generally closed within 30 days. "
Huh. Worked for a friend of mine no problem
Are you hiding under a rock?  He‚Äôs in the middle of a trade war with China and one change to our finance rules via executive order like banning Chinese companies from US stock exchanges until they follow our accounting and anti-fraud rules and he could collapse their internal economy overnight.
Oh I see. Thanks.
Alternatively you're just throwing your money away.
So apparently the whole thing is over, Blizzard caved to memes, and I still have all my stuff. That's pretty ideal.
If they refuse to cancel your purchase this is a quick and easy way to ensure they don't receive money. They brought them on themselves
No, nothing so dramatic, but there isn't much I can do beyond denying them my money and showing my support.
Thanks, I did see that but I don't really want to send Blizzard a copy of my ID at the moment just to delete an account. Seems a little silly.
I was unaware, thanks. The point still stands, turn them over to the BBB
Except that you never needed an ID to create your account in the first place. They literally just added this extra step so that people are more hesitant to delete their accounts in the wake of the backlash
I mean, I've never seen any company in which you create an account require a government issued ID to delete your account, whether it's a gaming company, a social media company, hell it could be a baking company. I could see confirmation emails, authentication codes, etc, but this is bullshit.
Please pay $50 to receive access to a panel stream 20 minutes before the highlight reel is thrown on YouTube.
It‚Äôs an amazing marketing scheme. Please pay US money, for the privilege of watching commercials for our products all weekend.
You also get in-game goods (skins, etc) and access to behind-the-scenes VODs, streams, the archive of past events...

Honestly, I think it's a good deal, if you are a fan of Blizzard and their games. (Naturally, that's a pretty big *if* currently, but I've bought the ticket on previous years, and don't regret it.)
We must admit that blizzard know how to milk their no life fanboys... From hearthstone and overwatch, its still impressive to see how many people spend their money in these games.

So at the end, i guess 50$ is nothing for them.
Yes...and people willing to pay for such things are a major reason why we have this situation now. With some people willing to buy anything Blizzard-related, even if it has close-to-zero value, Blizzard learned that they could get away with anything. Well, until now.
Bro you can pay $20 to sell someone else game time, that they pay for in-game with fake money. (that now has real money value because of this system. ex: warcraft gold is worth more than some countries currencies.)
It's basically a PPV event, not that odd if you think of it in that context.
They tried to justify the increase last year with the Classic trial but they didn't "adjust back" this time around, unless they are doing something similar.
It generally gets you a rather high-quality mount and Pet for WoW, skins for OW and SC, a pet and a vanity item for Diablo, a skin/mount and portrait for Heroes, and a card back and a couple of packs for Hearthstone.

Its basically letting you get the in-game goodies attendees normally would get.
LMAO WOW
Yeah, this really puts into perspective the Diablo mobile fiasco. You probably remember gamers being called "entitled" for not wanting to play a phone game, but these were people who spent 200$ on a ticket just on *rumors* that there might be a new Diablo game.
To be honest.  With how it‚Äôs shaping up right now.  That might be some of the memeiest, funniest and cringiest 50 bucks you‚Äôll spend this year.  Although, not worth it because watching YouTube highlights gives them no money. Still good value for the shitshow it will inevitably be.
It's a free market and you are free to not pay.
This made me irk
Yea $20 price hike
.... why would they threaten a gay-pride parade in Canada?
More like the poor ccp who show up. I really feel bad for them if they try, it will be a shitshowm
I saw one or two twitter people slinging that bullshit earlier today. It was really weird. Like one minute they're talking about Xenoblade Chronicles and the next they're calling everyone blind sheep for not seeing the truth about China. 

Then back to their sword porn.
Who cares about gay pride and gay parade bs? Theres more important stuff to fight for atm as those peopel who lives under dictatorship in china and other places in d world
Yep. It's not that weird, E3 tickets costs $250, and it includes companies you're not interested in. I would probably have gone if I were anywhere near US.
Not that much, really. Conferences in general are pretty expensive
+ accomodaton + flights

It's not unusual for people to spend $1500+ on Blizzcon overall.
Yep, the idea of the century. Gullible people will pay to be subjected to advertisement. Exactly like E3.
I've been twice, it was worth it a couple years ago and a lot more fun before it was expanded.  Now it's like Disney Land, everywhere you go lines are long and everything is full.
It includes a live concert, costume and music contests, demos of new content, panels with creators, and access to all the championship games, as well as a bag of virtual and physical loot.
This kind of attitude is annoying. This attitude is the exact reason what you say may come true. Its very similar to the idea of "tragedy of the commons" though different in context.

The more people think like this, the more _this_ will happen. The more people hope for the best, pish for the best and do not act deafeatist like this the more likely actions will succeed and last.
Let's not get defeatist this early! If we think people will forget then don't let them! When things start dying down then make sure to bring this up in comments and threads about blizzcon, or whatever blizzard related news comes out in the future. If you're censored then post about that, don't let it be swept under the rug. 

Tell friends, let them know why you're not playing. Tell your family so they know not to buy you any ow/ wow/ blizzard related things for birthdays and Christmas. 

We need to stay positive and determined to make a difference.
They wouldn't be insured on cancelling an event due to negative pr XD
If it spreads to a large enough portion of the crowd will they empty the room?
It was NetEase, the publishing partner which oversees and controls all Chinese operations, not Blizzard.
Just pointing out that the actual text does not say "our country", it says "ÂõΩÂÆ∂" which means "country". Because of how tightly coupled the Chinese language is with China, "country" by default means "China". Inserting "our" is one way to translate this but it may give an incorrect connotation.

Official Blizz Apology TO China (with extra sucky sucky) 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dflohh/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/
Welcome to **all** companies. It's a feature of capitalism. Profit over principles.
Nah, I would still be against any company requiring a copy of my ID card. Such copies are given out in very rare occasions and it is done in paper form where you have to sign the paper and state that it is correct with the original and that you basically allow it.
In my country entities with the exception of your employer or some specific institutions/companies aren't allowed to ask for my ID
Is it a circeljerk if you hate a shitty company for good reason?
\>If the China fiasco wasn't happening there wouldn't be a single person whining about the ID-required thing  


True, but that doesn't mean what they are doing is okay. Requiring personal information that can be used for identity fraud to delete your email address from their database is not only highly illegal (GDPR), but also morally wrong.
Well I tried to delete my account a *few months ago* and they did require Photo ID. It was so much of a hassle I left my account open. But this is not a change due to the recent events.
Well, sending a photo ID to a gaming company that sides with oppressive foreign governments that use facial recognition systems isn't exactly the best idea.
They can still require proof that the person requesting deletion is the person who owns the account, companies usually use photo ID to do this.
My guess is that they're receiving too many requests at the same time that they can't catch up?
Then they could implement a log in with my national id card framework? If they really demand an identification method then that's the simplest way that won't send any of my private information.
Well, if there's enough of an issue, Blizzard can be fined substantial amounts, and potentially even be banned from trading in the EU. I get that data protection matters are a bit beyond your level of understanding, though.
Not everyone is fortunate enough to have a right hand.
No. :(
In fact, China treat "the state can feed you" as a important human right, others...won't matter.
rights don't exist, it's some bullshit on a piece of paper.
*"Destroyed their career"* is kind of overselling it. He's been propelled even further into the public spotlight and already received several lucrative offers, one up and coming game even pledged to pay the full winnings and invite him to their upcoming 500k tournament.

While the manner in which it happened isn't ideal, if anything he's probably coming out ahead.
Agreed
Seems only right he violated the tos
What is gdpr?
This is a great idea. 

I probably won't get any visibility here, so please edit your post to include this link: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/nightmare-letter-subject-access-request-under-gdpr-karbaliotis/

It's sort of a template for a worst-case data request for a company. This should hit Blizzard hard.
I believe both, however both are EA
Ea took the side of the oppressive Chinese government?
Don't forget about the clusterfuck officially known as Anthem.
Apex
Apex.
Companies operate to sell products or services that their consumers demand. If the consumers demand a product that is oppression-free then some company will meet the demand. Maybe not now, but eventually.
There is such a thing as stakeholder capitalism that actively eschews the viewpoint you're describing as unsustainable. I'm not saying that what you're talking about doesn't happen, but there are companies that don't subscribe to that model. Blizzard has just shown that they're firmly in the profits over people mindset.
[deleted]
Why not both?
Well that's 2/3 of gamers deluded then lol. But you are not wrong. $¬£$ is all they care about
This is so ignorant and short sighted. Any self sustaining company cares about their consumer... Period. Look at Tesla, google - Joe Mode. Amazing story. Look at Wal-Mart, Costco, Amazon, these companies relentlessly catered to their consumers and they are massive or growing exponentially because they met a demanding need from their customers. There are plenty of small and large companies that care, just because companies like EA and Activision exist, does not mean most of the free market doesn't care. The best part of free market capitalism is companies have to care, or they risk going broke because you can simply say no to them and they can't force you to buy their products... 

&#x200B;

Unless you're in the back pocket of the government, then they will bail you out with borrowed money financed by future generations through the fed, regardless of how reckless you operate as a company. Or you have folks with no self control, buying games from trash companies regardless of just how trashy their games or practices are... If you don't like a company, go somewhere else that fits your needs, plenty of great indie devs that would love your and others support..
Companies don't truly care, but people within the company often do.
Companies don't view anything in any way because they aren't people. The individual employees, even the ones at the top running the show could be just as compassionate and interested in doing the right thing as you, or they could be complete pieces of crap.
It‚Äôs a copypasta from [this Apex Legends post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/crykix/pr_team_and_devs_well_done_you_have_alienated/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
It‚Äôs a copypasta.
Fair enough
\^\^ lmao.
Yes but I'm sure that the one making decisions are the ones who never even opened a blizzard game in their life and are counting only the money. Like Kotik. Brack has just been placed at such a high spot solely because he's one of the last pillars that players recognize as those who built the foundations of the game, regardless of what happened with classic.
I think getting banned for rude jokes that you were warned not to make and getting banned for saying you support your country during a humanitarian crisis are different levels of bent over for china
officially fired for sex jokes, which are also taboo btw

but that was not the only fuckup during that or any other chinese event

just make it go away and forget about it, since more than half of 120+ million dollars annual dota2-community investments (1/4th of which goes to the prize pool) are from chinese whales

moni toks
making jokes about china is something else then voicing your protest against a dictatorship.

you should apologize for inappropriate jokes but protest is a different case.
That‚Äôs being extremely disingenuous. 2GD was just completely ignoring directions from producers because he was trying to keep the show entertaining in his own way.  

This was way less of a ‚Äúyou upset China‚Äù and more of a ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt following directions, the thing we are literally paying you to do‚Äù.
That's not really bending backword.
> And people ignore that.

So should we ignore this, or are you evoking Whataboutism?
WOah there buddy. Stop making shit up. It was definitely not about China. I dont agree with the firing but for a "pinnacle of dota" type tournament ( let's exclude the international for now ), 2GD was EXTRA...spicy with his foul language. I was entertained by it, I love it. But I dont blame Valve that much for that. This wasnt a couch tournament. It was a Valve sponsored event that was supposed to retain a tad of professionalism. 2GD went overboard with offenssive jokes. And it was not cause of China.
Gabe then called him an ass on social media. 
Well Gabe, I'd rather be an ass than a Chinese bootlicker.
James was warned repeatedly to stop making sex jokes on stream, he was subsequently fired when he failed to stop. You can talk about Valve failing to defend Kuku's racism last year but that's hardly defensible.
Remember Chingchong major and Kuku ban, although that also comes with its own separate can of worms.
Yesterday some user told me to stop using the /s tag because it ruins the fun. I tried to explain to him Reddit often doesn't get irony without the tag but he was having non of it.
Lmao imagine having to comment this to two separate people in the same thread who posted 15 minutes apart
"brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image"? 

I think all those points are up for argument. Supporting HK is hardly disreputable or offensive, and the only ones damaging Blizzards reputation is Blizzard.
Totally, hence why he is talking with lawyers.
Ye I doubt there's anything he can do to get that prize money back at this point.
Courts tend to view vague or broad rules in a dim light.
Just because he agreed to the rules doesn't mean, that these rules are legal. Denying the prize money of the last season? That sounds hardly legal, at least here in Germany
I'm not so sure about that. 

Making vague rules like that can tend to be unenforceable, and it comes down to what a "reasonable person" might think about their actions causing that level of harm. 

&#x200B;

Saying "Support Hong Kong" doesn't rise to the level of damage that a reasonable person would think damages blizzard or the community.  I mean look at the outcry. The reaction to all this shows that most people think its Blizzard thats being unreasonable. 

&#x200B;

I'd be real careful to assume that a judge will rubber stamp blizzards decision. Well... I mean a US judge, anyway. Not even sure what role a Chinese judge has in their system.
The problem is that particular rule he ‚Äúviolated‚Äù is worded in such a way that Blizzard can ban anyone for saying whatever they don‚Äôt like.

Besides even if he started preaching his entire political ideology on the stream, which he didn‚Äôt, i still think taking ALL the prize money away is just a scam move, apply a fine with a percentage if you must, but not take the whole thing.

Its like playing soccer as a kid and when you score a goal, the owner of the ball takes it away and says he won, because its HIS ball.
Except the rule he broke would be considered completely unreasonable. It also revokes a US citizens right to due process
but the latter statement which hearthstone china has claimed that they were defending the pride and dignity of their country aka china
Be more of a corporate shill.
"brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image"

That rule is so vague it could be applied because they didn't like his sneakers.  A good lawyer will be able to argue against this ambiguous rule.
Sadly there are many costs to suing such a huge company otherwise someone should sue just for shits and giggles because this sure looks like "on purpose deletion prevention".
Well then write to the EU, they have a pretty good track record of going after big corporations, as of late
You can sue *and have a good chance of winning* for that.
Ah isn‚Äôt freedom so nice?
I just went through the process of right to be forgotten on my ear accounts. I gotta say they took that shit serious.
Nope, they are enforcing ID's now in europe also
Canceling something that bills you and deleting your entire account are two very different things.
They do.

I just tried to delete my account from Germany. they want my ID. They won't get my ID, but they want it.

I'm looking into how to make a claim with EU consumer protection right now.

Edit: According to someone at r/LegalAdviceEU this is completely legal, because it's sold as a measurement to make sure no one can delete an account that he shouldn't have access to.
[deleted]
GDPR is class
Contact them requesting deletion under article 17 of GDPR, they have to comply then. Just another way the EU stands up for it's citizens.
It's illegal to ask for a copy of ID where I live since this July, with maximum punishment of two years in prison. There are some exceptions to this, for government related stuff, but not for companies like Blizzard.
https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/2659
blizzardsuckspoohdick@*longlivethecomunistparty*.com
You think you want ID but you don't
They need it to give to China, so they can plan ahead for which camp you will be re-educated in once they take over.
Not really. Other companies require that when something major related to account change. Riot games required these information from me when my accounts got hacked.
That's not Blizzard's concern. If the email address owning the account asks you to delete it, you delete it.
I did more than that. I blacked out the whole thing except ‚Äúdrivers license‚Äù and my name. They don‚Äôt need to know the state, my height and definitely not my address.
They really want your personal information.
You can even fake the picture with one of those Deep Fakes face pictures of people who don't really exist. What exactly would they be checking it against anyways.

https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/
Yeah.. I wanted to visit China in my life, seemed cool, but i guess for now its off my list.  Back to Japan!
Federal government, yeah.
I agree! ID acts as a safety net for the people who might have gotten their account hacked
You guys are mental.... when they did not ask for an ID when creating the account they habe zero reason to request on when deleting.
Why would it make sense for changing account info but not for deleting an account? It's the same principle. What if your email gets hacked (as it almost certainly already is if someone else is attempting to delete your account)? Then your SOL if all they do is send you a measly email reminding you.
Thanks, I was wondering if there was a financial issue with not being able to cancel or something? You can tell most banks to stop payment or cancel a card if that's the problem. If it's for protest then all power.
But WHAT? This is what I dont understand
2FA has been hackable for a long time. That alone is not enough and this isn't a new thing that they're asking for ID
Tencent is a major stock owner in activisionblizzard. Tencent is chinese.
With how much money they make from China, they might as well be.
This is really fake news!
To be fair, they've been asking for an ID for big account modifications for a very long time, I remember being hacked back in wotlk and having to link a Pic of my ID to the GM in chat
lol zerohedge

That shit is faker than Trumps tan.
In the US you most submit to facial recognition to obtain or renew your driver's license.
My US driver's license was rejected for not being a valid government issue ID.  Which I guess is true from Blizzard's point of view: it wasn't issued by the Chinese government.
It‚Äôs not from China so of course it‚Äôs invalid
They can ask for verification, which imo is actually a good thing. Wouldn't it be pretty annoying that some hacker got access and just clicked "delete" and your account was gone?
Me too,,all they asked for was a phone number to send a pin code to.
Not an id.
Yep. Australia here, so I can't speak for other countries, but they asked for ID and then rejected the application based on "region".
That is not at all why they send you a link. They send you the link because it is easier that way.

Also, there are systems in place that can check if a from address is faked or not, just by simply checking the email header.
> It's stupid easy to fake the From: address of an email message.

You can't spoof the sending server though. And if your mail provider uses at least SPF, it should be easy to find out if the email really came from a specific account.
>> i can send them an email BOOM PROOF!
>
>Ha, no. It's stupid easy to fake the From: address of an email message.   

Here is a video of someone photoshopping a pizza into a woman  
https://youtu.be/9j656_RiO0k
I can donate a game to the DAV, sell at a garage sale, effectively giving up my 'rights' for the license. No id required.

This is an overreach.

Send an email like "we noticed someone tried deleting your account, is it you" type emails I've received from other companies. You could argue the email account is also hacked, but that's a stretch.
Uhh, no. They are outright denying even the ID people sent in, so your logic doesn't really hold up there mate.
What I get from this whole post is that you need to just blindly jump the bandwagon. So please don't try to add any kind of sense here! (/s)
I can't access my original account as I used a fake name since I set the battlenet account up when I was 16 and didn't want to use my real name, so I send ID and nope doesn't match account details  >. >
Did you delete your account this week? That‚Äôs what people are saying. Blizz is creating new hurdles to delete accounts.
[deleted]
I thought a lot of games required Korean ids to sign up for because of some curfew law for people under a certain age? Or did I dream that up
Maybe true for America.  Not true for all countries.  
It would be illegal for them to do that to an Australian Citizen for example.  You can use the drivers licence to verify the person for their age or for who they say they are, but you are *not* permitted to access government issued ID numbers for this purpose.  
This is why private parking companies in Australia have a lot of issues.  They can't access the database of numberplates to find out the owner.  As such, they can't really pursue the person for unpaid fines in their private parking lot.
What if you're not from the U.S.?
I mean are they hiring people who are trying to be informative or are they hiring people who are trying to wank off the board members? 

"Yeah, we have about X cancellations a day on average and this day we had 154\*X cancellations but only 10\*X of them mentioned Hong Kong so the other 144\*X cancellations were uhhh... you know, just, variation."
I‚Äôll be off, Azeroth. Catch you later Hyrule.
...You mean Bethesda? Blizzard doesn‚Äôt make Skyrim.
Would you say cancelled sub is enough or should people delete their accounts?
Wait, am I missing some context? Why would Skyrim coming out influence cancelation of Blizzard accounts? 

(Sorry, I'm not really familiar with Blizzard beyond what makes it to /r/popular, like this post.)
[deleted]
Thanks, autocorrect error
That‚Äôs almost certainly sufficient, though tacking on a HK wouldn‚Äôt hurt
Of course they will, don‚Äôt be ridiculous, if only for the simple fact that it‚Äôs literally someone‚Äôs job to quantify these kinds of things to execs.

They‚Äôll want to know the metrics and how many people are doing this because they actually care vs the hype - it‚Äôll play a role in their response as well as their statistical models on how many people will come back when this all blows over
Even if they can assume the reason they won‚Äôt. Data collection does not take assumptions into account.
If you think they don‚Äôt have a team working on it right now then you‚Äôre incredibly naive.
This is actually completely illegal in the EU because of GDPR. The company is not allowed to store data about you if you ask them to delete everything they have about you. They would be fined an enormous amount of money if they did. Just one case of not being GDPR-compliant would cost them 2 % of their yearly revenue.
I mean, they already have your credit card information, billing address, email, and any other information they collect off your accounts, and they collect info off any device you use blizz products on too.

They already have all that information, an ID doesnt give them anything they dont already have on you.
[deleted]
Honestly I get the outrage over the Blizzard controversy but checking your ID to verify it is you is a rational move.
You spend hundreds of dollars buying a game and some schmuck gets your username and password, should they be able to delete your account easily?  This kind of setup actually exists for a reason
And your license not being on record since creation anyway. What are they even correlating it with??
You can black out everything but your face and your name on any id and they'll still take it.  They do it so that its near impossible to have someone else delete your account unless they have your email, password, emails password, 2 factor, and your id.
It IS a typical back up option if your 2-step authentication is down due to mass traffic. Are you really this blinded by your Blizzard hate-boner? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Oh. Thank you.
Preach to em man
And all Kramer got was free coffee! Injustice!
To add, she only wanted her medical bills paid (~$20,000). Mcdonalds only wanted to give her $800, far less then her bills were. When she took it to court, it was the jury who wanted mcdonalds to instead pay $2.9 MILLION to her. She however settled for less then $600,000.

This woman waw being NICE to mcdonalds after they had almost killed her with coffee way above the point it should've been it. Prior to the case, they had over 700 reports of coffee burning people.
TIL
I also try to educate people to the truths about this case so don't take this the wrong way but you got a number of facts wrong: Firstly, it was not kept "150 over normal", it's temperature in the case filing was said to be "180-190F", if that was 150 over normal then normal temperature was 40F, does that sound right to you? 

&nbsp;

Secondly, she did not suffer third degree burns over a "large portion of her body", it was localized to her pelvic region (mostly thighs and genitals)

&nbsp;

Third, she was not hospitalized for months, her initial hospital stay was for 8 days, and she then received continued care (without lengthy stays) over the next 2 years for the skin grafts. Also while the injuries were not insignificant, she did not "nearly die" from them.

&nbsp;

Lastly, the case was never about "negligence in training and running operations", it centered around the fact that McDonald's sold her a defective product which her attorneys successfully argued the 180-190F coffee was

&nbsp;

Again, i don't disagree with your intended message, but if you're going to fight misinformation with facts, at least have the right facts.

&nbsp;

Addendum: after this case it was found that many other establishments, including non-McDondald's restaurants, kept their coffee at similar temperatures, and in fact McDonald's did nothing to change their procedure in the making or handling of their coffee, and it is today still kept at that same temperature, all they did was make their coffee cups a little thicker and put more sternly-worded warnings on the outside of the cup that the coffee was very hot

&nbsp;

I am not siding with McD's or any corporations however, i absolutely acknowledge and agree that they waged a massively successful propaganda campaign to discredit this poor woman and turn her case into the poster child for frivolous lawsuits in America, which is not right and should be called to light.
Uh, that was Tim Sweeney @ Epic, not EA. Although I do live under a rock other than about the last five minutes, so it could be both...
Depends on whether the No China package is DLC with lootboxes
They have yet to take *any* stance in their customers' favour, so they can suck a fat one.

Also, that was Epic, not EA.
With all these issues and mass uprisings against EA, I think adding "we are pro China" to their list isnt something they want to do. Especially since they are still fighting politicians on lootboxes, I'm sorry, "surprise mechanics."
And Nintendo's just standing off to the side doing its own thing, like usual.
But it is not because it disable the 4 other ways to delete the account to ask for a I.d. picture. The other 4 ways were also reliable but noone wants to give their i.d. so itll stop people from deleting account
The only reason Id on't think it is sensible is because they never asked for your ID to even start the account so what exactly are they checking your ID against? All the information on the ID could be photo-shopped and fake but how would they know? What exactly are they checking for here with the ID?
Look up the Black Hat security conference in Las Vegas and the work of James Pavur or even some articles of the French authority (CNIL) on this ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
This isn‚Äôt to delete an account, it‚Äôs to get rid of your purchases FOREVER. So you tell me if someone‚Äôs account was breached, it should be as simple to get rid of the products they own as pressing a delete button? Because sending ID to protect your hard earned cash is so hard and so unreasonable?

0 chances against laws. You‚Äôre mixing things. But you know what‚Äôs nice? If it is, we‚Äôll know real soon.
That's hilarious and I'm in the mood for mischief.

I might even append 'alternatively, you could action my request to delete my account'
I was a potential customer who logged in the other morning to get some info about wow classic (the S/O played back in OG and wanted to play it again) and read what they did, we chose to get FFXIV instead.
Yes.
I use Lastpass, I'm fairly certain I'd know if it typed it correctly or not.
Who doesn‚Äôt use password managers?
except tencent has things in their stipulations that nothing gets passed without going through their representatives on the board in most of their investments. So they effectively can stall the company if they don't get their way and really cause hell.

5% that can cause the 95% some real hurt if they don't get their way.
That's all fine, but it you don't stand against this you are standing with them. Your games worth that?

Edit: whoops, this is what I get reddit in when I'm tired. You are making a stand, I commend you.
That's not irony, unless you think the Chinese authorities being appeased are the ones hacking your friends' game accounts.

*It's ironic you would use an African company to install your home security because I was robbed by black people.*
Calm down and think about your actions. Delete your account if you want after a few days. I don‚Äôt think deleting your account will hit them any harder than just unsubscribing. 

If so happens a few months later when everything boils over and/or blizz made a huge u-turn, you might end up wanting to play something again, then you will have to spend on a game only, filling their pockets unnecessarily. You might hastily say no now, but who knows down the line.
Believing in things and jumping onto a bandwagon are two different things.
In fact it is in the EU
Yeah dude, I suggest it was.

By your standards, you're aware of all the products and services you're using that you're being an hypocrite for, right? Let alone just the games, since they own a big share of a majority of all AAA multilayer game devs like they do blizzard, but also companies...

Like... Reddit, for one.

So, I guess you can't be on reddit anymore, right?
For many people,  this is the first time they've heard about what's going on with China.  No need to to gatekeep just because they weren't there from the beginning
I have similar sentiments, but the reality is that people now live in little bubbles they have constructed for themselves and ignore anything that would make them uncomfortable or force them to deal with what is going on around them. If this is what it took to make some people look outside the bubble and be pissed at what they found, I'm okay with that.
Given that the stock is near guaranteed to take a significant hit now, it would be a great time to buy blizz stock I think once they rebound from this clusterfuck.

Because the current value IS going to drop over the next few days to possibly months, depending on how this goes on and the impact it has on blizzcon.
Bad idea, with all this conteversy it‚Äôll plummet. If you buy it at it‚Äôs lowest they‚Äôll likely recover if you want to risk it but hey I‚Äôm no stock genius
Sure, I'll try to cancel my Battle.net account via Article 17 (I live in the EU) but idk if it will work. I won't give them my ID that's for sure

Edit: Done it via SMS verification
Someone pointed out that last year on Overwatch League someone was promoting LGBT+ and Blizzard didn't ban this person. Don't know it's true.
Congrats, you worked out how civil disobedience works.
>It's essentially just a security check to attempt to prevent accounts from being repossessed.

Then why are they using it as a way to prevent people from deleting their accounts?
People are not pleased.
No, I do understand it. It's a very lame attempt at PR spin by you. Either you are connected to the company through employment or you are oddly attached and "loyal" to them as though you were. Feel bad for you either way.
people ARE dicks.
With GDPR you should get it to work somehow, but maybe not with a simple button but an email. There are good prewritten ones on the web.
Timing is everything.
And yet you call me names.

Ooh I see you deleted that....gee why?
Due to how Hong Kong's human rights are being grossly violated with China trying to forcibly assimilate a place that would otherwise want to be a city-state, lots of horrific stories are heard from Hong Kong.

Blizzard, by taking those actions, are saying "We don't support those who support Hong Kong, we'd rather turn a blind eye to the atrocities over losing potential money that we could maybe perhaps get in the future should the Chinese market favour us."

Since most of the Western world values freedom and hate authoritarianism, many are enraged at such a decision by Blizzard, which tramples many of the core values they themselves said they had.
That's what several people told me after the fact.  At the time I was wondering "If the photo is required, why even have the other 4 options on the page?"
If they refuse, yes. That's why I wrote illegitimately. Like: "Don't try to cancel by just calling your credit card company." You still have to, at least, try to cancel the normal way.
I don't think you understood what I'm saying.  BBB has no actual power at all, and are actually quite corrupt.  They have been selling high ratings to companies for years.
They didnt add anything.
[deleted]
Well then you haven't tried to delete your accounts.
Blizzard asked me for photo ID when I asked to remove my authenticator about 3 years ago.
Tbf what you are actually paying for is the 2 in game pets. The in game Onsie, and the two Overwatch skins
And I thought 50$ was too much to see Kojima on Russian Comic-Con
But you'll get this exclusive x for game y if you do it. You'll be special... Just like us, here in Blizzard.
the coverage of the show/panels/floors is pretty good, yes, but most are paying for the goodies
There is talk of E3 doing a virtual ticket but itll get you access to all the demos at home
But muh video game skins
i always bought the virtual ticket and never bothered to watch the stream. if you play all Blizzard-Games its kinda worth it. This year you got 2 exclusive pets and a transmog-set for WoW, 2 exclusive Skins for Overwatch, Hearthstone Cardback, Skins for Starcraft and i forgot if there was a HoTs reward.
It's also something events like this do so they can dump these tickets on people and pretend they just "gifted" them something of value instead of basically just.spamming a hyperlink.
Overwatch loot boxes are cosmetic so there's no reason to spend money unless you really want something specific.

Hearthstone has 3 modes: Pay-to-Win, Arena, Tavern Brawl. I personally will never pay for cards.

Heroes of the Storm is the real freemium cash grab. You can only play with a limited set of characters at first, and to unlock the rest you have to play 100s of hours or pay $50+.
Worked with a kid who said he spent hundreds on a hearthstone deck. I mean atleast magic you get a physical card but good lord.
Except, generally, a PPV event isn't some hyped up marketing event for the event organizers own products.
Because China is extremely anti LGBT

Any movie or video game with a gay character or even reference in it is automatically banned, it's literally in the law.
Because originaly there was a pro-hk group that was allowed to march with the gay pride ( a group organized and made of gay people duh ) but the pro-ccp side threatened to "sabotage" the parade. So beying the totally strong people who stand up for human rights the organisers are, they decided the best course of action was to boot the pro-hk side. Under threats...
Two gay guys from Hong Kong were going to march with a pro-Hong Kong message on their shirts.  The pro-CCP types heard about it and successfully badgered the pride organizers to get those two expelled from the march.
I'd imagine gay people might care? Huge percentage of the world still makes it illegal etc. Even where it is legal people are killed for being gay by horrible religious crazies and whatnot.
You completely miss the point but ok. üëå
E3 I'm less surprised about tbh.

I might just be a bit biased though because of how they handled Blizzcon last year.
Wait a minute, i thought E3 was for professional only, so i checked and saw this :

https://www.e3expo.com/register/attendee

990$ to see trailer and company stands, people are pigeon, what the hell.
Yeah not knocking blizzcon but in my opinion atleast E3 for someone like me would enjoy a ton more, a bunch of new game reveals, im not super informed about blizzcon but im pretty sure its pretty much just blizzard and a couple other game company‚Äôs. While E3 is/ was a bunch of different studio‚Äôs showing off there up and coming new games for the year. Maybe im just biased cause ive always really enjoyed watching the E3 shows every year and blizzcon while i do enjoy some blizzard games just isn‚Äôt nearly as enjoyable. Maybe im crazy and misinformed if so my bad.
With all the free swag like T-shirts they give out, it's more value to go.
I would have understood E3. Many companies are in there. But just for shitty Blizzard? Not really. No.
It seems pretty weird to me, you are paying $200 to go to an advertisement
Ah, right.

Obviously I've never been to one. Thanks.
Isn't Blizzcon a fan convention, though? Not a conference? Those *should* be cheaper. I'm not they *historically* are or anything, just that they should be. I don't know.
I think it‚Äôs expensive even for conferences. I believe this year is $230? By comparison PAX EAST is $200, but that‚Äôs for 4 days, not 2 days. So blizzcon is more than twice as expensive, for a more niche lineup.
Tali actually said it best here:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPrFvcdKxWw&t=16m5s
> Let's not get defeatist this early!

Most here even forgot what Blizzard did earlier this year. Had a lot more immediate impact too.

Not blaming anyone. But it's hard to get riled up when I know that nothing will change. Sucks for Blizzcheung. Really does. Better choice would have be not to be dependent on Blizzard in the first place, but I get that this was his one shot. Gotta take that.
If they cited health and safety, of event goers and members of staff, they'd be covered no doubt. Never underestimate the ability of big corporations to save money
Surely it will be noticable just by the fact that you'd get hundreds or thousands of people complaining they were kicked out. Either way it puts blizzard in a tough spot. Kick out fans that will surely be very vocal about it and put blizzard loving China back in the western news or upset China
 further. So it's a win win either way!! I encourage everyone go and do this.
The irony is that it was published on an official Blizzard channel. It represents the company. Officially.

Representing political views on a Blizzard channel is what they banned Blitzchung for.
They use Blizzards branding and name though. Legal technicalities are irrelevant.
"*Most*" companies, I think, would be more accurate. But, yeah, what a shame.
Blizzard went bad when they started kowtowing to the demands of an *authoritarian state*. Not because they produced a thing you wanted to buy.
If you're fabricating problems, yes.
Thanks for clarifying.
I'm not *sure* of anything atm. I haven't deleted my own account so I don't know what the reality is.

There are three real possibilities the way I see it.

First: They've always required photo ID for this (no idea why any given person's ID was rejected)

Second: Overloaded

Third: Preventative while they hope this whole thing blows over. Even stalling a couple days could salvage hundreds or thousands of accounts if this dies down at all.
>Then they could implement a log in with my national id card framework

They sure could! Although their main playerbase doesn't have a national ID card framework, so it's questionable whether they'd implement a system for that sort of thing.

>If they really demand an identification method then that's the simplest way that won't send any of my private information.

True enough.
I resemble this remark!
r/therealjoke
I‚Äôm actually now wondering how the island city of Hong Kong is getting their food currently.
You dropped this: /s
The casters need to be taken by someone else too.. One of the casters was crying on stream I believe.
I fail to see how this damaged Blizzard's image. Also they shouldn't hold esports stars from politics. How else are pro-players supposed to secure basic human rights?
Blizzard violated their own TOS not to mention internal logical consistency (but who needs that in China) in their Chinese weibo release.
The portion of the tos they are using is a catch all, "offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image". Anything you say can offend someone.
The EU's **G**eneral **D**ata **P**rotection **R**egulation.
As part of it you have a right to access data stored on you:

    Individuals can get access to all of their data from a given firm, including their employer, by filing a subject access request.
    The GDPR will eliminate the cost for subject access requests and shorten the required response time from 40 days to 30.

The best part is, this applies to companies doing business with EU citizens, so you yourself don't have to be an eu citizen to make use of it.

So long as blizzard does business in the EU, (and they do) you can use the GDPR to request your data from them.


^(^TBH ^this ^last ^bit ^is ^the ^bit ^I'm ^a ^little ^unsure ^of, ^that's ^how ^I ^understand ^it, ^but ^it's ^possibly ^wrong)
Done
I felt oppressed playing their games tbh
I honestly had.. bigger letdown than when my inflatable girlfriend sprang a leak.
Hahahahahaha
So, what, some other company offers Wow?
What law, specifically?
There is no law that states to profit and to increase profit yearly.  
What you are talking about is a part of agency theory of reducing agency loss where, in protecting the investment of shareholders, incentives are put in place for the company executives to ensure profits thus making sure that anything that is seen as a better avenue for profit will be considered and implemented.  i.e. rolling over to the Chinese.

As pointed out  there are companies that strive for long term sustainability instead of short term profit grab.  The problem is that while company direction is decided in a democratic way in annual meetings it only takes a small percentage of active shareholders that show up and vote to change that direction.  As original shareholders convert shares to cash as their interest and involvement in companies wanes there is unfortunately the trend for profit takers to step in and gut the holdings and trample on the founding ethos.
Trust me when I say this.  The is no law that says corporations must make a profit.  Nor LLCs nor sole proprietorships etc.
So a Non Profit is the devil eh?
Your kidding right? You blame capitalism when clearly the coercive and much more wrong actor here is a communist totalitarian government?
Didnt Amazon operate on loss year after year to drive out competition?
There is no such law.

In short, very short, a company has to stick to it's stated mission statement.

" company becomes incorporated "

I'm sorry, but do you really know what that means?

My company was incorporated. i.e. became a corporation. I am in no way legally bound to make a profit.

Think about what you are saying. If what you said was true, it's not, that means a company who didn't increase profit is breaking the law. Does that make any sense to you?

&#x200B;

There are a lot of problem, we don't need people making up imaginary laws and confusing the issue. Please Stop
That is bullshit. You cannot make a law predicated on a prediction. Point out any companies which had product flops or fell out of style and sales were hurt, did any of them get sued for breaching fiduciary duty? I‚Äôll quickly answer that they did not. You cannot predict future profits any more than you can predict a loss.
not trying to be rude but I suggest you study business a lot more before you talk about it. this comment is incorrect on multiple levels.
Removing that law won't fix a damn thing. They got a taste of what ' More Money ' is, they'll want more until they are dead in the water.
I was being generous
Theres a difference between catering to consumer needs and actually giving a damn about them. It seems a lot of people were under the impression that Blizzard did the latter
Cheers

It's not just the getting banned, People are forgetting that Blizz also took around 10k of Blitzchungs pre won WINNINGS. 

They robbed the shit out of him, and then banned him and fired two innocent interviewers. 

They need to go down.
Are you defending valve for siding with china here then? If your going to say oh well... you are siding with china.
You got a source on that? It sounds absurd
Valve banned a caster for making jokes because china said so. And said they will never work with him again. Over a joke.
Yeah I ignore people who complain about that because I don't enjoy downvotes tbh.

You'll get downvoted less for using /s than for not using it
He isn't wrong though.
I don't know enough about the situation to say myself. but is it not true that there are people from China who view those rebeling negatively, in which case somebody spreading their political agenda in what should be an esports related interview is something blizzard has every right to find issue with.
It's "In Blizzard's sole discretion"

They covered their asses. That phrase essentially means 'we can ban on a whim for no reason at all, just cause we felt like it.'
I think that perfectly describes what has happened to blizzard's image as a result.
It is incredibly disreputable and offensive. If you are a Chinese despots bitch.
From a business perspective, that dude had no right to use his win as a platform for a political issue. Yes HK needs support, but what has Blizzard got to do with that? He fucks their business whether they support HK or support China. They should be suing *him*, but he couldn't possible afford the damage done.

People deleting their accounts of *this* are a bunch of idiot lemmings. There are plenty of legit reasons to delete.
>Supporting HK is hardly disreputable or offensive

It IS to China and many of the Chinese public. That's the point.
Yeah, I think for the last at least 15 years Blizzard hasn't needed any help from *anyone* to ruin their reputation. I'd go as far as to say that nobody could possibly have done a better job.
They arent up for argument sadly. Because it clearly states, " In Blizzards sole discretion". So it's gray area rule. Meaning you cant do anything about it.
"In Blizzard's sole discretion" is the key phrase. They get to decide if your breaking the rule or not. It's basically a catch-all rule they can use to punish you for anything.
The member states each have an institution people can complain to. If there are enough complaints, the national data protection authority might start an investigation, but depending on which country starts it, it's more likely they'll solve the issue instead.
If you have the capital to fight the case AND your lawyer believes your case strong, you should get costs awarded back at the end.
It's not actually the EU you should be complaining to, but to your local official data protection office. Every member state has one.

I also recommend sending a mail to the Blizzard data protection officer first. These requests are handled manually, and if they fail to comply, that's another breach of the law. If you ask them to delete your information, they have 30 days to comply.

If you do want to delete your account, I recommend to also ask them to give you a copy of all information they had on you prior to deletion. You are legally entitled to this. If they later get sued by someone and it turns out they handled information improperly, you can use that as evidence to claim damages.
In capitalist America; America steal back with interest, comrade.
It‚Äôs illegal, but they still do it.
Won‚Äòt let me delete my account without government ID.
I am gonna complain to the EU privacy office 
https://imgur.com/a/SsOCFF2/
They are also requiring IDs in Europe. This is so someone with a grudge can't get all your stuff permanently deleted.

I mean... hurr durr America sux!
But muh gunssss
Please do let me know how this goes. I'm in EU and want to delete my account as well. I'm not sending them my ID details.
What are they gonna do wrong with your ID though?
That's going to sting for Blizzard. GDPR fines are insane.
 [https://www.csoonline.com/article/3383244/how-to-report-a-data-breach-under-gdpr.html](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3383244/how-to-report-a-data-breach-under-gdpr.html)
It's the right to erasure that is under the GDPR umbrella in the EU. I.e, you have to implement the right of erasure to be GDPR compliant.
Already mentioned that in my first try. They ignored it. I reopened the tt.

I only have D3 though which I haven't played in years and don't intend to ever play again :D
+100 to your social credit score. Congratulations, you now have a reduction of 3 days for a future liver transplant. You are 50 credit score closer to your next nationalist level with increased perks and more love for your country.
If you know the email address you can send a fake email from that address without knowing the password.
I'll be relocating this when deleting my account today. Let me know if it works for you if you get the chance. Thank you.
unfortunately for you they can pretty much get everything on you if they were so inclined.  It doesn't take that much info to find everything on a person.  Just how the world is
Zero reason... Other than the reason clearly outlined in the comments you're replying to.
Well I want to delete my account but I don‚Äôt want to lower my social credit score.
Its only 5% that Tencent owns ([https://www.marketwatch.com/story/activision-blizzard-suspends-e-gamer-for-hong-kong-comment-2019-10-08](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/activision-blizzard-suspends-e-gamer-for-hong-kong-comment-2019-10-08)). 

&#x200B;

But from the behavior of Blizz you would think its 100%
"Major" is a stretch. Tencent owns ~5% of Activision-Blizzard shares. In contrast, Epic has taken the opportunity to try and earn back some good will by speaking out against Blizzard's decision, and Tencent owns ~49% of Epic Games.

Let's not shift any blame off Blizzard for this. They're not in a "our hands are tied" type situation where they're being puppeteered against their will, they're _willingly_ and eagerly sucking China off without having to be "asked".
 do a simple search and you can easily confirm :

nice shill for blizz and the chinese communist party.

zerohedge is just a news aggregator and they always publish their sources in their articles if you want to verify.

But what are they verifying?  I signed up for my account when I was fourteen.  No ID at all, and I have an *extremely* common name.  It's be ridiculously easy to make a fake ID to delete my account.
Huh, did you have any info for them at all? All I could remember was a server and a character name.
Holy shit
-
And people were laughing about GDPR, are you laughing now?

In EU we have more rights than some ~~American~~ Chinese company. Do you see now why Reddit and pretty much every tech mega crop was spreading anti-GDPR propaganda?
But do you really expect a tiny lil indie company such as Blizzard to have the high class technology to do such a thing? Don‚Äôt be so naive. 

/s
Only if people have SPF / DKIM up. Some smaller shittier mail hosts still doesn't.
I'm pretty sure an *enormous* amount of accounts get compromised because a person uses the same email/login all over the place including battle.net.

So if some dbag has your Bnet info in a lot of cases they have your email as well.
There's no "logic" to debate here. I'm letting people know that this is for deleting your account, not unsubbing.

The response was specifically to this statement:

>I had to send my picture ID to them. Although now they are using this as an obstacle to unsubscribe as oopose to the last layer of security.

Which is, as far as I know, false. It's not for unsubbing, it's for outright deleting your account or removing 2fa.

If you want to bitch about them requiring an ID or outright not letting you delete your account that's a different conversation and I agree with you completely.
And naturally they at least for years didn't allow you to change your name without a photo ID either. So there's no way you could fix it. Now (naturally when I don't want to use their services anymore) I can change my first name if I please but still nothing I can do about my last name.
I realize what people are saying, I'm more saying I've observed a general increase in the hurdles over everything to do with accounts in the past few days. Also pointing out that it's ridiculous to start requiring government issued IDs for anything to do with any of this.

Edit: OH I was referring to them never requiring an ID for me to fix my authenticator
What's a facebook onion address?
Christ, this is the most uninteresting comment on Reddit.

Then I guess it works differently. Idk, I'm not an expert in all national laws. Two Americans were talking so it wasn't really relevant.

Thanks for at least adding to the conversation by SAYING something about how it might be different somewhere else. Oh wait you didn't
They hire people to do a job, and if your job is *"tick the box if it specifically mentions Hong Kong"* you tick the box if it specifically mentions Hong Kong. Why would you start doing text analysis and a guessing game on the other tickets just to determine whether or not they are related to Hong Kong when that's not your job?

Believe it or not, but some people are currently unsubscribing for reasons other than Hong Kong.
What did Nintendo do?
No I meant Blizzard. People would put Skyrim as their reason for cancelling their WoW accounts.
That's a personal choice but I would just cancel the sub. You delete the account and character wipes take place after 6ish months I think. If the sub is cancelled the account  remain intact.
Skyrim was just released and people knew they would be getting immersed in a huge game, didn't want to spend 12-15 bucks for a game they wouldn't play. I had the employee code so I didn't have to worry about money being wasted.
Whenever you cancel your account, sometimes they would have a "do any of these up and coming games interest you" kind of section and it would have checkboxes for games.

So you could just ally up the amount of people who clicked the Skyrim box vs having to dig into comment boxes talking about Skyrim.

the auto correct was working for Blizzard
Same is happening for me, am based in Germany.
Don't have to get caught storing it when a copy is saved on your overlord's servers
It's not checking your ID, it's covering their backs. If they delete and/or give someone else access to potentially thousands of dollars of your digital goods, and you then sue them over it or something.  
They can say; *"Look, we asked for an ID, we got their ID. We did our due diligence to try and make sure it was the right person. It's not our fault someone committed identity theft to break into this account."*
Getting downvoted because you said something reasonable and rational lol
Another poster said something along the lines of your character not actually getting deleted until about 6 months after account deletion, i.e. the more reasonable option is to show for account recovery rather than Big Brother requiring sensitive personal information in order for you to tell them you don't want to use their product anymore.
They didn‚Äôt require that info when they took my money years ago, why do they need it now? Why would you even remotely trust them with something like a copy of your drivers license with your photo and your address on it? What makes you think them or any other company will keep that info secure?
While I agree with what you said... I wanna point out that a LOT of people feel very uncomfortable giving blizzard our personal info now. They clearly are giving it to china. Also... what they are doing is illegal in Europe. You cant make it harder to cancel something than it is to start it. They dont require a i.d to set up a account. It's a very clear violation of the gdpr.
I don‚Äôt know what their current security situation is, but way back in cataclysm someone managed to get my account, which had an authentication on it, and completely lock me out. Took blizz 2 months to get me back in, but of course everything had been long sold off and characters were deleted. When I tried to talk to someone about getting my shit back the response amounted to‚Äù you tough titties, shouldn‚Äôt have been locked out for so long.‚Äù

ah, a shillbot
The name and birthdate you gave them on registration to confirm that you are the account owner.
> Prior to the case, they had over 700 reports of coffee burning people. 

400 from *that specific restaurant*.
I might be remembering a different case then, though I believe both of them involved a woman who was initially suing for medical compensation alone. The one I'm talking about had the coffee stored at about 240 I believe, though I could have misremembered the number since it has been a while. thinking back though, I'm not sure the case I'm talking about was about McDonald's. I'd look into it if I wasn't at work right now, but I don't have time on my break to find out the exact case.
That's right. But there was also a post flaoting around here, listing the companies that stated that they won't be affected by China and one of them was also EA.
EVE Online is just spinning away in the background, ignoring the rest of the world.
I'm not saying it should be as simple as providing a delete button.  How they verify your identity is their problem.  I know for sure they can't demand you to provide ID card information.  It's obvious they are doing this to prevent as many as possible to successfully grant their request.  You say there is "0 chances against laws" (whatever that means) but there are existing precedents and EU has shown to be really tough on this even when it involves big companies.  Concerning your comment "of wasting your time": all I need to do is fill in some forms and my local government agency handles it from there.
You can't just say "yes" and not provide any actual proof. I've yet to see a single instance of that occurring.
12 yrs old blizzard fanboy
As true as that may be, "Tencent owns a majority of the company" is a very specific turn of phrase and is not up for debate or interpretation as to the meaning.

In a culture that clings heavily to soundbites and headlines, wilful misinformation and inaccuracies cause far more collateral damage than they should.
Dude just said he unsubscribed from and uninstalled WoW. How can you insinuate he's not standing against them after that?
No way, I am living through the tear gas police state we have here right now, and Blizzard chose to side with a communist dictatorship over a single player who said a small slogan that no one noticed. China is only 5% of Activision Blizzard‚Äôs revenue. They already did some dispicable things to their (now former) employees. I have no intention of supporting this company again. There are many other things I can play.
Whatever validates your own world view, dude. I didn't delete my account because I don't see value in it, but if others due, that's on them. No need for me to get their approval for my own actions either.
Agreed
A company like blizz should absolutely rebound. This is a good time to buy if it's aboht to tank. Add on to the fact that blizzcon is next month, call of duty comes out at the end of this month and people on the internet have week long memories. You'll likely earn a good chunk of change if you started buying
Some would argue that human rights are not a political matter - they should just be the default. But, to be fair, by that standard supporting Hong Kong is also not political.
Yes, and he accepted his punishment and people everywhere are revolting against Blizzard, who literally just enforced their own rules. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If I were to guess, because people are screwing up the process.
Nope i'm not spinning it nor am I attached, nor am I defending Blizzard, they fucked up and everyone knows it. There is usually a simpler solution to why things are they way they are, I am simply providing a more plausible explanation then everyone else who is loosing their minds over why the deletions are "locked". Yes companies can be super evil I wont deny that and hey maybe Blizzard is Satan incarnate but only time will tell.
Are you for real? Just because someone is rationale enough and doesn‚Äôt support your agenda, he‚Äôs somehow affiliated to the company? It‚Äôs not him you should be sorry for.

For what it‚Äôs worth, I don‚Äôt see you complaining about this feature years ago when this was implemented.
Haven't needed to change country, but just to delete an account should not need ID on this kind of scale.
Not even facebook needs your frickin ID to delete your account
Even without all the HK issue, $50 for two in game pets and a few skins is still way too expensive.
i would have bought it for the OW-Skins alone. i spend like \~600 ‚Ç¨ into Overwatch. i think it would be kinda hyprocrite to start now with "oh no, this is to expensive"
You got in-game items it was $30 also
So basically you're paying for a condom you cant even really use?
Tbf what you are really, really paying for is someone other than you to own a real life yacht.
Is one of the pets this year a small light brown bear with a penchant for honey?
$50 for basically a microtransaction bundle still seems insane.
what about hong kong bro
> Overwatch loot boxes are cosmetic so there's no reason to spend money unless you really want something specific.

Therein is the predatory scheme of it all, though.  The game is not even F2P, yet they aren't even courteous enough to allow us to buy specific skins for real money.  You have to gamble.  It's like paying to get into a points-for-prizes arcade and still paying for the games, then being told you don't get to choose your prize.

"Here's 5000 plastic spider rings. Try again if you want that video game that was popular two years ago."
But Tracer is gay...Overwatch is still there.
I figured the Parade might have done something they feel is offensive but no, just random lunacy.
There's no LGBT people in China.
Just a degenerate Western thing, obviously. I blame the 70's.
But... it‚Äôs in Canada.....
Revolting, and that's an understatement.
Thats what they own punishment for siding with left wing politics and communism progressives instead of siding with the right wing which actually does fight against all that bs as communism and anti freedom
Eh, I really only cared for Overwatch, and from what I know, their discussion panels are pretty cool, so for me last year Blizzcon is just fine XD
It is, the problem that MANY trade shows have is the general public or the wrong types of businesses often want to attend. It's in the event's best interest to offer a really high ticket cost that will dissuade 99% of these people who don't belong, but for the truly crazy/rich that do it anyway the event makes bank.
When I went it was only like $200
It‚Äôs not really an advertisement though. The people that go are diehard blizzard fans so there‚Äôs not much more to sell them on gamewise at least from my personal standpoint.

This year will be my third blizzcon and I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs well worth the price because the community is so great to be around. Being able to sit down at one of the eSports events and just creating easy conversation feels so awesome. This year is going to be quite interesting though, I have no idea how this mess is going to play out.
Some people spend $200 on cocaine most weekends.. soo... not that crazy man
Well, yeah. I¬¥m not sure. I¬¥ve been to some corporate conferences (paid by my work) and the tickets were something like 500-700 euro and I was really caught off guard by that. 

And often times it wasn¬¥t anything special. 

Never been to fan-con tho.
Better be a legit reason or the insurance company would file attempted fraud because they are also corporate and hate to lose money. I have yet to NOT see a insurance company send out a claim agent to investigate. Besides a fine there wouldn't be a insurance company that would even consider covering any further event they happen to sponsor if they tried to do something bogus...
Even if they dont allow any costumes or anything related to HK they cant stop people from using their vocal chords (yet).
yeah but the rules don't apply to them! DUH!
They're incredibly relevant to anyone looking for the actual truth of the matter and not just trying to spin up the hate machine.

* The comment posted above is completely in line with everything else posted in the propaganda state that is the CPC; it shouldn't be surprising to anyone.
* NetEase's use of Blizzards branding and name is part of their contract, just like it is with most other westernized things marketed in the east.

Yeah, it causes confusion, especially as everyone is waiting intently for Blizzard-actual to say something, but you shouldn't be assigning one groups words to another, especially when one of those groups is literally run by the state.

Facts are important, especially in times of confusion.
Fabricating problems of people not being allowed to shut down their accounts without facial ID, which is a giant red flag for a company that works for China?

Could anyone explain this one to me?
Afaik, food can be resupplied if TW, US or Japan want to kick in. But water will be big issue, also electricity.

and no, rights do not exist, you're livestock, they can take everything from you at any time
I was referring specifically to the previous posters comments which were in regards to the *player* being "singled out and career destroyed".

As for the casters... it's a stickier situation for sure, they certainly got the short end of the stick **however**, it's hard for me to feel *too much* sympathy, as they were very clearly complicate in the matter.

*  They saw Blitz come out in Hong Kong protest-like garb (goggles, face mask), which is at the very least a warning sign.
* They repeatedly told him to "say the 8 words and then we'll cut". The "8 words" is a reference to the liberate Hong Kong rallying cry, and so it's pretty hard to imagine they didn't know what he was going to say when they're were encouraging him to say it before he said it.
* They ducked down behind the desk, which seems weird from a westernized standpoint, but is a sign of deference in that they want all attention on him and his words. Now this is an important distinction considering that they didn't do this at any other time in the tournament, so again you have to question how and why they were acting differently here if they had no idea what he was going to say.
* They're also bound by similar rules as the players themselves, namely in representing the company they're working for at the time. Rules which, by the way, are designed to dissuade people from hijacking these events in order to push whatever agenda they want (political or otherwise).

So in light of the facts, I certainly still feel bad for them... but I also think it was justified. It should also be pointed out that they're independent hires without any contractual obligation, so they weren't "fired" so much as they will not be "hired" in the future. It still means a loss of future job prospects, but it's not quite the same as a full time employee getting shitcanned.
It hasn‚Äôt damaged anything, it violated their tos so they banned him. He can preach about his politics on his own time.
Where did blizzard violate the tos?
Yep and that catch all caught someone. It‚Äôs his fault for trying to push his political agenda on blizzard and it‚Äôs fans.
All of them do.  World of Warcraft was just a ripoff of Everquest with a bigger marketing budget. 

I'd suggest Final Fantasy 14, personally.

He's not speaking if the kind if law that people go to jail for.  He is speaking of it as a truism.  Once your company has gone public this is the law.  You must have infinite growth or your company will die.  Since infinite growth in a closed system going public is also signing your company's death warrant unless you have shareholders like Nintendo does.

The CCP didn't proactively warn Blizzard about this, they did it of their own accord to protect their dealings, so in this context,  capitalism *is* to blame.

Additionally, mainland China is currently in their capitalist phase, which they consider a necessary step to successful communism
My kidding
I almost upvoted you thinking you were being ironic.
Also, it‚Äôs not a real law so there‚Äôs nothing to remove.
He's the example of modern age business CEOs. Just cares about the money, doesn't care about its customers, doesn't care about what they say, doesn't care about the enviroment ( this goes for others) so they keep producing regardless of the damage they are creating.
You're comparing apples and oranges. I watched the Shanghai Major. James '2GD' Harding was fired for his inappropriate jokes and nothing more. He was even told by the production to tone down on those jokes. 

He made several racist remarks too (in jest of course) so that probably didn't help his case. There is a huge difference in firing someone for supporting a revolution and firing someone for the way they're hosting a multi-million dollar tournament that you're organising.
Have you even seen what James said in stream? https://youtu.be/aVerBZfwWAs if you said that as a caster for literally anything, you would be fired
This guy is not siding with China, because his point is completely valid. Getting banned for Pro-HK/anti-China speech and having you prize money taken away after you have *already* won it is very different from someone doing that same thing *during* an ongoing tournament. It doesn‚Äôt matter what kind of speech you make, as long as it is during a professional event one should remain professional which talking about politics is not.
There is pro China, and there is 'its the right thing to do' but happen to be pro China.

Do you live off making fake news?
Except GabeN also fired the chinese production crew who was useless and called them out in the same post where he called James an ass.
I‚Äôm not saying he‚Äôs wrong, I‚Äôm saying that not only was someone so stupid that they made that comment, but another person was dumb enough to see this comment 15 minutes later, ignore the response to the other comment and make the same stupid comment
I think the problem arrises when they tried to take a political stance instead of outright just not caring about them. Would've been much smarter to just let it slide and say that they aren't affiliatef with the political opinions of anyone, because they're game devs, not a political party.
The reality is that in many areas terms and conditions which are deliberately vague to the point of being uninterpretable are actually not legally binding. So he has a leg the stand on.
Well I know a lot of people hate any kind of freedom, so youre right, anything advocating for it should be banned because they might be 'offended' by others talking about it..
"We can do anything" is not an enforceable contract.
You can't sign away your actual rights in any form of contract. Well, you can, but it won't hold up.
"Look what you made me do"
I, for one, cancelled my wow subscription because of financial reasons

I'm doing my part!

And idk, saying "from a business perspective" and "people (blizzard customers) deleting because of this are idiot lemmings" doesn't make any sense. Customers don't like decision, customers take their money and leave. Not nearly as harsh a punishment and a general statement on not being political would have done fine. They should have taken their time but they took a reactionary stance that makes them seem very pro China, which is a hot take at the moment, if you haven't noticed

If anyone should be fired,  it's whoever made that decision, their decision gave blizzard a political stance where it didn't need one
Blizzard would have been fine if they just cut away from him and said that they are just a gaming company and the political ideas of their players do not represent them. China couldnt be mad at them, we couldnt be mad at them. All the backlash is definitely their fault, not his.
It's offensive to Blizzard's business strategy is what it is
You mean something like the consumer protection groups? Sorry I am not a legal expert. I am European though and would jump on a complaint bandwagon xD
At this rate Russia is gonna be freer than america
Please do and post an update. Fascinating!
Yes, America does mostly suck
Trade them for this pack of salmiakki
Easier to get those than to cancel an account for a video game, freedum
I googled around a bit and don't really know where to complain. I already asked r/LegalAdviceEU, so hopefully someone there can point me in the right direction.

&#x200B;

Edit: I send a complaint to my countries consumer protection agency, including screenshot of the Blizzard site that wants my ID. Looks like my best option.
Risk of identity theft.
If they're refuse to cooperate with a GDPR request, submit a report to your relevant authority. They can get into massive trouble (fined up to 4% of turnover) if there's a pattern of non-compliance. GDPR does not mess around.
I was planning to dive into D4 with you üò¢
However -110 social credit score for using forbidden metaphors online.

Also, happy cake day!
They can send you an email and you can reply?
Genius. With what will they cross-reference your ID with to prove you are the account holder of that email? Why should an hacker be questioned if they send their real ID in? I ASK YOU WHAT IS THE POINT?

They are just farming data and naive idiots are giving out all their info for nothing.
5% still is a massive amount considering the total value of Activision-Blizzard though
It‚Äôs only 5% but they give them access to the Chinese market so it‚Äôs way more than it seems
Activision+Blizzard has more than five times the net worth of Epic. 

5% is more than enough to buy significant influence within a company valued over ¬£40 billion. 

I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs about the shareholders though. It‚Äôs most likely blizzard bowing down to the Chinese overlords so they don‚Äôt lose 10-15% of their market (or whatever it is), knowing how fickle the communists are. Without taking morals public outrage into account it‚Äôs probably the ‚Äúright‚Äù move, economically.
Buy a ticket and come to China.

You can use a Google GFI phone in China - No need Facial ID.

Most of the families have cable internet.
By the way, Download an app called tiktok or Douyin China. You can learn more about China.

I am in China now.  

There are some fake news  spread on China social media too.
Also, why would a hacker delete the account? They want personal profit, they gain nothing by deleting the account.

Except if by "Hacker" they mean "ex boyfriend who knows the password"
John Smith Johnson is right.
I was just making a point, that there should be in no way a 'need' of your ID to delete your information \[from Blizzard\]. There are plenty of other means available to verify who you are who you say you are.

What's more - I don't ever recall being required to produce a legal document stating I have the proper authorization to use the credit card of mine for my monthly sub. do you?

'requiring' a govt id to delete an account is, at a minimum, an overreach. Especially in countries that have laws PROHIBITING it from even being a thing.
Fair enough
Jeez don't take it personally or anything.


The point I was making is that Blizzard asking for ID is bullshit because even if there's a registry to compare it to in the US, that still leaves then entire rest of world, so you could easily change your details and they'd have absolutely zero way to check.
They'll look at trends and infer from that. With such an obvious reason for an increase in account terminations, every standard deviation above what was expected will be assigned to this.
[This](https://youtu.be/c9eGtyqz4gY) is eight freaking years old
When was that ? Under GDPR you can demand for an imediate deletion of any of your informations
Sorry, I don‚Äôt think I get where you‚Äôre going with this comment, maybe just a r/whoosh on my part
...what do you mean same is happening for you?

germany is in the EU.

they ask for ID to prove it's actually you trying to delete your account that you've spent money on, then delete the data due to the fact it's illegal to store it.

this is a very  *very* common practice in customer support for most companies in the EU.
Isn‚Äôt that the way of Reddit?
Not really no, unless you are very active. There are people who stop playing blizz games for more than 6 months and then return later on.

I would be furious if my account got deleted easily by someone.
Those scenarios are not really comparable. If someone got their hands on my account, why would i mind if they paid for my gametime? I would on the other hand be very angry if they deleted it, so it makes sense for the deletion to be harder.
They compare it to your credit card details, or at least that‚Äôs what Sony does
But that is no proof, so they have no proof on record although they need it on account closure. The asymmetry in their required legally binding documents strikes me as real strange. You'd think that if they need a license on account termination, they'd correlate it with a similar license from creation, or else they might just as well not care about licenses altogether.
Yeah, I think it‚Äôs most likely you‚Äôre just misremembering in this case. Water boils at 212¬∞F, so the only way to do what you describe would be in a pressure cooker.

I'm too lazy to find more, but there was also an Australian fellow here on reddit who just cant delete his account because his ID gets rejected. I've just submitted my own request today, and added a scan with blacked out sensitive information. I'll let you know if they will accept it.

EDIT: The've denied my request.
If you don't want the account then disown it. The high security for deletions and the high quantity of requests right now means that they likely simply don't have the manpower to process them all right now, so if you really want to delete it then you're going to have to wait a few days.
What if Blizzard ends up splitting off from Activision, or is bought by (non-Chinese) owners later? The executives responsible for this would be gone and it would be ok to come back.

Not to mention if you just cancel your account but don't delete, they have to pay for storage (which is a fraction of a minuscule amount per person, but still). Cost them a little money.
nobody gets rich by buying stock during controversies, by trying to look smart you are proving to be a moron with no idea about how to make financial investments.
Yeah, that's what civil disobedience is. You break the rules you feel are immoral/unjust, accept the punishment and hope for the public to pick up on the fact that unjust, immoral rules should not exist and force the entity enforcing the rules to abandon them.
Meh facebook says otherwise.

You know, people pay hundreds of dollars for collectors editions that comes with cheap plastic figurines...
Not when you look at the average price of said items
You can get money for free by selling your gold on the in game marketplace
You never played Path of Exile, it seems.
1.99 is way too expensive ....
Sike. Blizzard sells single pets for $30.
People ate it up for an early access version of Classic WoW that lasted  a weekend.
You should see the skins for path of exile rofl. $64 wings and capes. $12 for a skin for boots. Etc etc lol
You must be new to Blizzard, that shit has been the staple lmao
So I guess you aren‚Äôt an idiot who buys fortnite skins
you should play war robots, easy $500 for a basic robot

She isn't gay in China. They changed her sexuality so Overwatch can be played in China.
Tracer isn't an LGBT character in China and Russia.
Because blizzard, the pandering assholes they are, removed them from the Chinese and Russian versions. They added them to pander, and they removed them to pander.
Wasn't that just a revelation made in some promotional media that never gets referenced in the game itself?
Not in China, they changed her back story there.
Gay, but in a way that is easily cut in China. AFAIK her gayness isn't referenced in game - only in outside media. Same with Soldier 76,
She isn‚Äôt gay in China.
>But Tracer is gay.

Not in china
Ya know conservatives in canada and in the US and in Brazil (figured it's like that in other places too) are know for voting agaisn't gay rights? Why would they side with the cons when they fight agaisn't them? Maybe if you spent less time in your life being angry you could understand this.
Fair enough ^^
You also generally get free invites to give out if you have a stand there. It‚Äôs how these events work in the line of work in in.
What you are paying for by going to a business conference is basically (in theory) value to your company. That easily translates to a lot more money than the entertainment value one should expect to receive by going to a fan convention. Its not that its special, its that its *valuable*.
Yea yea yea, and technically Blizzard in Germany isn't the same Blizzard as in the US. It's still the same commercial structure that profits off the local market under the same name, face and product, while feeding money back to the same shareholders. By all intents and purposes, NetEase is Blizzard in China.

NetEase isn't groveling in front of CCP under its own name and brand, they do it on the behalf of Blizzard.
The fabrication is pretending this has anything to do with the Blitz fiasco. This has been their mode of operation for YEARS. They're not trying to prevent people from deleting their accounts, they're making sure that your account doesn't get deleted (forfeiting all your games & wow account characters) unless it's actually YOU and not a hacker. And they've been doing this for years.

TL:DR It has absolutely nothing to do with China.
We just say Username checks out...

Whoops sorry sir. You dropped your mask
It was on his own time... You don't see the problem? Blizzard doesn't own him yet they destroyed his career. If Blizzard had a problem they should have gave him a warning or handled it at all differently. They decided corporate policy is "The esports player's human rights don't matter"
In his head canon right next to thrall had intercourse with ragnaros.
I love how supporting people defending their freedoms is simply a "political agenda" to you, it's not like he got up and yelled let trannies use bathrooms! Or whatever. America, where blizzard enjoys it's own freedoms, was built on the idea of liberty and justice for all, and like with the Truman doctrine, we should support it everywhere. While you are technically correct, this is clearly far more complicated than what you are saying.
Personally, I really *wouldn't*. And I say that as a long-time XIV player and, despite what I'm about to say, fan.

It's got plenty of content, but almost all of that content is sloooooow to get to and hard-locked off until you either plod through a glacial and needlessly padded month-or-two storyline or pay three times for three separate story skips.  
If I didn't play from ARR then trying to catch up now would be a burnout waiting to happen.

Plus, let's not pretend for a moment that XIV's combat isn't utter on-the-rails shit with little to no adaptation.

Honestly, it's got strengths, but it's an FF game first and a compelling MMO very *very* second. For a WoW player looking for something WoW-like it's practically anathema. 

For that I'd probably suggest TOR instead. Maybe Guild Wars 2 if you thrive on companies willing to lie to their long term player base to sell a sequel.
That‚Äôs a definition, not a law. Laws are things like CA Revised Statute 10-301 that are codified.
us legal.com though, that won't apply to most us.
You mean like a law of physics? That‚Äôs not how what OP wrote reads to me. And no offense, but you aren‚Äôt OP so I‚Äôm not sure that you really know what kind of law they are speaking for. How else does OPs use of ‚Äúlegally bound‚Äù make any sense if not referring to the kind of law that people go to jail for?
How about you show me this law that states corporations must not only make a profit but increase that profit year over year.......I‚Äôll wait.
Because you are an adult that knows corporations lose money all the time and it's not a criminal offense.
Capitalism doesn't prevent any company from acting in a moral way. 

This is just a complete and utter garbage company with no morals that should be, and will be , punished by its userbase and shareholders like in any normal (capitalist!) society, that should be the conclusion.
The only reason this situation is even in the realm of possibility of occuring is because China is authoritarian and communist.
They did it in fear of a totalitorian communist government which shouldnt even exist under capitalism.

And nope.. capitalism cant exist without protection of private property which China doesnt have. China is more accurately described as fascist. The government can dictate what a "private" compay can or cannot do.
When most of your corporations are what's called state owned enterprise and your government has no respect for private property that is fascism, aka corporatism, not capitalism.

Watch the clips here https://youtu.be/aVerBZfwWAs this would be why James was fired
But there is no reason he can't inform the second idiot of the definition of Irony, again, since they clearly missed it. Idk, i see the guy getting downvoted as if he is doing something wrong, I'm just confused.
How is that even relevant besides people liking the joke of a big company not being indie? Is anyone defending their actions saying that or is this just a meme people like upvoting?
It would have been. However, that is a completely separate argument to "did they break the rules?", to which the answer is probably: "Yes, what he said was offensive to the chinese market".

There's a big case to be made for "even if he broke the rules, they shouldn't have", but he's not wrong in saying that sueing is likely to not have a good outcome because of this.
They literally shut them down completely, they don't support politics on their platforms... it's exactly the response you want them to give, 0 tolerance for politics, they took no side other than their own and the Chinese people profited from that to make their cause even more known to the west (yes, this is all a coordinated and highly taken out of context attack from China). The few thousands that got caught up in all this are simply naive since they don't bother to actually take logic into consideration or people with mental issues, the anarchists which are in the hundreds in reddit comments which is absolutely horrifying, because they actually gain support from other bozos, thankfully they almost exclusively seem to be from America and not anywhere near Europe.
It's not politcal at all. People just don't want to die or have thought control.
But "at Blizzards discretion" is an enforceable contract.  It's pretty easy to make a case that he expressed a viewpoint that Blizzard doesn't support, on a platform, owned and payed for by Blizzard.  Legally, they will not, under any circumstances, lose a case against him.  He doesn't have the resources to pursue trial against a multi million dollar company, and his best shot would be a rookie lawyer trying to make a name for himself with a high profile case.  Even then, Blizzard has dozens of lawyers hired on full time.  So as immoral, and stupid, it is, they certainly won't have to pay him a dime.
The person who said that during the blizzard competition put blizzard in a position where they were going to lose something, no matter what they did.

Complained too soon. The Blizzard self-service portal is not your final option, sending a DSGVO form letter to Blizzard's Data Protection Officer is. You should complain if they do not adequately respond to *that*.

e: My German isn't good enough to find all the relevant information and list it properly.
A company such as blizzard? You already trust them with your credit card info.
I received a new reply to my ticket.

They basically state that the request to see the id is in lieu with data protection. Do you have any information on how to report this? Is it some sort of online form?
No you still need the password the check the emails, but there are ways to intercept an email and so you can reuse the same previous method to answer

It may sound that emails are not safe but these exploits can‚Äôt be done if people on both ends have proper security and are a bit aware on cybersecurity
5% is still only 5% no matter how many make up that 5%, in the grand scheme of things. Blizzard is worried about losing access to the Chinese Market. Meanwhile you have Tim Sweeney of epic that has vowed to upkeep free speech on all their games even though tencent holds 40% of epic. Trying to blame tencent just detracts from blizzards greed.
As far as I know blizzard has not received any money from tencent. That 5% was aquired by tencent while blizzard was splitting from vivendi 4-5 years ago. before the split vivendi owned a majority share of blizzard, as its parent company, and then sold off much of their shares to both blizzard and the public. Several investment companies including tencent acquired chunks of stock. There are a number of companies today that own upwards of 4-7%. The worth of shares purchased at that time are up more then 200% today from then. At the high point last year it would have been worth 400%. That should have made it a good investment. Also, Just because they own 5% alone does not give one investor significant power over any other. Now blizz could certainly have a contract with tencent we have no idea about but that is random speculation.

As it stands, blizzard's actions are their own fault and blizzard made the rational business decision without thinking about the consequences of the involvement of a significant world wide issue. A good question I think, and one we will probably never know, is how high up the decision actually went in the company. I'd guess it probably never left whatever part of blizzard is dedicated to managing esports  before being announced. It probably should have gone higher, major political involvement was probably above their pay grade. Another thought is we don't know how regional the management of blizzard esports is. It's entirely possible all of se asia is one managed block and I wouldn't be surprised if it was centered in china. tldr I think this whole thing was caused by lower management somewhere but since they represented the company the whole company needs to take the blame.
it says starting dec 1st

so in 2 months
Damn near close.  I've even met three different women with my name, one the same age as me, with my birthday.
>I was just making a point, that there should be in no way a 'need' of your ID to delete your information [from Blizzard].

That's true, but I honestly *appreciate* the extra security. And it probably saves them an assload of work. I know you (and a lot of others) rightfully don't want to give out personal info if you don't have to. But the things the I.D. protects are potentially extremely valuable.


> I don't ever recall being required to produce a legal document stating I have the proper authorization to use the credit card of mine for my monthly sub. do you?

Nope! Only once to get 2fa removed. Had to remove 2fa from PS4 and they just asked me questions about my purchase history etc. Although the ps4 thing was concerning because they asked for extra numbers on one of my credit cards, which is also something that I didn't wish they have and didn't really want to divulge.

I think it's fair to say that if you want to delete your account or dick heavily with the security asking for additional info is acceptable, or at least the industry norm. What form that takes and what data is saved needs to be better communicated to everyone involved though. Because yeah, if they were saving my ID information somewhere I'd absolutely refuse.

Then again at least in the EU you can request all the data they have on you. Not sure about US.
There's some actual content to add, good job
I mean....you're both right.  It's just that you'd use the OP's method if you wanted to underplay the narrative.
They have 30 days to process and comply.
Any of your **personal** information, your in-game character isn't personal information.
This was 2007/2008
If I provided my ID when I signed up, yeah, I can see why that would be important.

Don't know why would I do that with an account that didn't need that at all.
Yeah I think it‚Äôs weird because I obviously didn‚Äôt show any ID while signing up. Other people in this thread also said this wasn‚Äôt legal in the EU.
>	I would on the other hand be very angry if they deleted it, so it makes sense for the deletion to be harder.

EU law disagrees with you it would seem. If blizzard wants a government ID then feel free to give them the easiest way to get your identity stolen. They didn‚Äôt ask for proof when they gladly signed you up to take your money, asking for that kind of proof afterwards isn‚Äôt something I think is reasonable. I don‚Äôt trust blizzard to have that kind of information and neither should you.
You'd have to bear the same name and be born on the same date as the account owner to steal his account this way. I don't quite get why you don't consider legal documents with your name and birthdate on it as proof.
Fair enough. We use different units where I work and that is in no way offhand information for me.
Neither of these are proof of them doing anything intentionally. Their servers are getting absolutely fucked. If you know anything about how these services work this is almost certainly due to an overabundance of requests. Their customer support isn't sitting there denying your requests.
I mean sure not rich over night but you're likely to make money over the long period of time. I know several people who have made money by buying stocks at times of controversy (like Nike and Kaepernick) or at times of tragedy (like (9/11). So maybe from what you've seen it doesn't happen, but again, I've seen it happen with people I know.
Except Blizzard is a gaming company, not the government, and they are the ones who punished the person. It would have happened in any tournament, in any country, to anyone who brought up politics. The content of what he said does not matter, where they were does not matter. He broke TOURNAMENT rules and was punished by the COMPANY THAT PUT ON THE TOURNAMENT. 

If an American gamer had discussed Trump at an event in America, he would have received the same exact punishment, because he STILL BROKE TOURNAMENT RULES.
I hate the DLC influx and the general state of gaming industry on that front, but cosmetics get a free pass to do whatever they want IMHO.
Wowwwww. I hadn't put the layers of charges together in my head. Such a scam imo.
They can throw their money down the drain if they have more money than sense but I call that a rip-off.
~~items~~ pixels
It is when you think about how it's clothing in a video game. I don't spend $50 on real clothing.
Actually, when you look at the average price for said items you realize that having digital clothing cost $10 or more a pop is pretty absurd and only for people with a lot of money and a lack of sense.
I did for a long time -still have it on my PC but haven't touched it in a while- and I never spent money on overpriced cosmetics.
to be fair my statement was easy to missunderstand.  
I mentioned the amount of money i spend allready in it to show that i don't see a problem with investing a certain amount. Gaming is my only hobby and i don't see any reason why i should not spend a few 100 ‚Ç¨ each month into it. Even thou i know the value of certain items and believe that those skins are pretty expensive (compared to what i get) i see that i have no other option but buying them anyway. cuz its the only way to get them and be happy with them. I just want them, no matter the price.  
I also believe that 13cent for 1kWh are expensive but i need electricity and will keep paying for it.
Oh my glob!
Eh?
IIRC the extra lore about her being gay never released in China.
Nope she's straight in China. China is crazy anti LGBT, there was a popular gay web series in China Called Addicted https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addicted_(web_series)

Not only did China ban the series the two creators who were real life friends are banned from ever seeing each other.  They have to holiday abroad to hang out.
She's only gay in the comics, and the comics weren't released in China.

Hence why her and Soldier have no references to their sexuality at all in game to the point of it being thought of as blatant pandering for the comics to suddenly make them both gay. They couldn't put that in the base game at all and still sell to the Chinese market.
Technically we never knew to begin with, nor it has any relevancy in the game. Blizz just slipped the comic later to western social media for fake woke points. (Blizz as a company doesn't really care)
Nope, Blizzard changer her sexuality so they can marketing overwatch to the gay poeple AND be good guys for once
[deleted]
There are a few things in-game. A spray of Soldier 76 with his boyfriend, and Tracer says about visiting her girlfriend in the King's Row map.
Yeah, got that the first ten replies.
I live in brazil and we have many gay people sided with our good president :) , we lived under communism government for the last 15 years they destroyed our country criminality is so high everywhere is dangerous to get steal, murdered house invaded and more.no jobs, everything is expensive, corruption everywhere, bandits everywhere, no food, no water, A killer stays in jail for a month then hes out. So whatusaid bout my country is a lie :) just search for karol eller a lesbian eight wing who stand by my president side or even bettee clodovil hernandez a right wing gay who got attacked bythose lefty communists who claim to "fight for freedom"  ;)
That‚Äôs not really relevant for Canada anymore
Yup I¬¥m totally aware of that! And so the blizzcon *is* cheaper.  $200 is a lot, but making it even less would be affordable for a very broad spectrum of people which isn¬¥t always a good thing. Also considering how much blizzard makes from people just playing their games, I would expect the blizzcon to be even more expensive.

And still we are forgeting about fact, that there is a good portion of people who are coming to blizzcon because it relates to their job.
Except it's not, it's Shanghai EaseNet's PlayHearthstone account (they're a subsidiary of NetEase). The company name is right there at the top of their page (‰∏äÊµ∑ÁΩë‰πãÊòìÁΩëÁªúÁßëÊäÄÂèëÂ±ïÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏).

It's also a state run company, in China, targeted toward Chinese audiences, on a Chinese media platform... so of course they're going to adopt a pro-China stance. Do you have any idea what a state run media looks like?

The only unfortunate part of this is that NetEase is licensed to use Blizzard's logos, just like that shitty "Official Game of Thrones Browser Game" is, yet whatever they put in the game certainly shouldn't be considered to be coming from the mouth of HBO directly. Yes, Blizzard could decide to cut ties and break their contracts over it, but it would cost them a fortune in current and future business revenue and damn near cripple the company - cancelling projects and laying people off would be inevitable, and that would only add more fuel to this dumpster fire.
Except it does, because in this way its bottle-necking people cancelling their subscriptions and even when they then provide it people up and down this thread are claiming that they are getting denied

Again this has nothing to do with human rights, it‚Äôs about a company‚Äôs right to ban someone who violated a tos agreement.
Capitalism saw it's 'pseudo-enlightenment area' in the '50s and '60s. Right now you are witnessing the other end of ebb-and-flow of this specific economic system. People are just not loud enough right now to MAKE corporations and governments understand, 'what' is in charge.
If you really want to protest or boycott something do it to China, the real enemy here.
He was using the publicity of blizzard around the tournament he won, that‚Äôs blizzards time.
Yeah. I‚Äôd try google if I were you. Great source to search for information.
I hope you're not holding your breath, lol.
It's not that kind of law.  It's like the law of universal gravitation, nobody goes to jail for trying to break it.
Capitalism doesn't *prevent* acting in ANY way but does heavily  encourage acting in the most profitable way by any means necessary including unethical ones.
Except China isn't communist by any real definition of that term.  It is a facist state in every way including its economy.
The Chinese government is about as communist as the DPRK is democratic. They have monopolized a large number of industries causing companies and nations to bow to their every move and look past the hurrendous treatment of its citizens and Hong Kongers under the fear of losing profit. It's totally capitalist.
But the totalitarian government *does* exist in the real world. 

Maybe capitalism is good *on paper*, but clearly it's failing in reality.
Blizzard is an American company that doesn't belong to the CCP.

This is just capitalists responding to the market.
From your actual link that you didn‚Äôt read. 

> Among non-experts, conventional wisdom holds that corporate law requires boards of directors to maximize shareholder wealth. This common but mistaken belief is almost invariably supported by reference to the Michigan Supreme Court's 1919 opinion in Dodge v. Ford Motor Co.
I read your provided link and I'm not convinced. The second paragraph states:

> In the 1950s and 1960s, states rejected Dodge repeatedly [...]. The general legal position today is that the business judgment that directors may exercise is expansive. Management decisions will not be challenged where one can point to any rational link to benefiting the corporation as a whole. 

It also includes a number of quotes from law professors on the matter. They all seem to contradict sojuhighball's statement that "corporations are legally bound to make profit," at least in practice. I won't quote them all, but perhaps it's worth restating one:

> Among non-experts, conventional wisdom holds that corporate law requires boards of directors to maximize shareholder wealth. This common but mistaken belief is almost invariably supported by reference to the Michigan Supreme Court's 1919 opinion in Dodge v. Ford Motor Co.

~Lynn Stout, Professor of Corporate and Securities Law at UCLA
Read a little further in the article m8:

>In the 1950s and 1960s, states rejected Dodge repeatedly, in cases including AP Smith Manufacturing Co v. Barlow[2] or Shlensky v. Wrigley.[3] **The general legal position today is that the business judgment that directors may exercise is expansive. Management decisions will not be challenged where one can point to any rational link to benefiting the corporation as a whole.**

There is no law requiring that a company increase profits from year to year. There are certainly other factors that encourage corporations to continually increase their profits, but it is more than a little misleading to use a single Michigan supreme court case to declare that there is a legal mandate for them to do so. There clearly is not.
Yes, but it's used to keep competing companies from buying voting shares and trying to run it into the ground, not to sue board members over every bad year in profit.
He‚Äôs saying it‚Äôs baffling there‚Äôs two people this dumb
You just have poor reading comprehension skills
Fairly certain referring to China as "our country" isn't far away from taking China's side.

It's also pretty easy to call bullshit on that claim because it is essentially "we can do anything" clause. I know nothing about law, but I heard judges tend not to side with the "we can do anything" party in such cases.

But yeah, the guy is SOL with a 99% chance.
In the US it actually would 100% not be an enforceable contract. A "reasonable expectation of prize money" would wholly overcome "at Blizzard's discretion" because the latter is deliberately vague, which is a super-no-no if you're taking something to court (but lawyers do it all the time anyway because most people don't take it to court). The ban from future events absolutely would still apply, but prize money already earned would have to be provided.

But last I heard, this tournament was in Taiwan? So it's maybe enforceable there.
Point 2 is flat out wrong.  They‚Äôre allowed to request additional information to verify that a request comes from the actual data subject, to avoid allowing an incorrect party to access unauthorized data (which would actually constitute a punishable breach).
You'd be executed in Finland
Of all the things the world should learn from Scandinavia, Salmiakki is not one of them.

ID info is a different level of theft.  It could lead to other accounts being opened in your name.
If you believe it to be a breach, your report would have to go to your country's data protection agency. Unfortunately, their request for ID could be valid, as according to the UK agency's interpretation:
>Can we ask an individual for ID?
>If you have doubts about the identity of the person making the request you can ask for more information. However, it is important that you only request information that is necessary to confirm who they are. The key to this is proportionality. You should take into account what data you hold, the nature of the data, and what you are using it for.

>You must let the individual know without undue delay and within one month that you need more information from them to confirm their identity. You do not need to comply with the request until you have received the additional information.

Of course, domestic German law may differ on this, so your mileage may vary.
Okay you win
This will never happen.
Let us see in 2 months.
That's incredible in a way.
There are laws preventing it from being an acceptable practice in some countries - that's the main issue of the entire thing, though.

\>  Nope! Only once to get 2fa removed 

And again, this is the point others are making - it's more difficult to remove your account than create, essentially. You are needing more things to remove it, than were needed to even create it. it's bogus.

It's an overreach.

You can submit history of transactions, etc. to the email on file, phone for 2fa (hell, REQUIRE 2fa even, that's acceptable, and even desirable), require a conversation with a CS rep (like most cable/isp providers, i.e. Comcast require, wish is annoying but acceptable).

&#x200B;

There is absolutely no logical reason any person should be required to furnish a govt document to remove their information from a company's servers. none.
You doing okay? Need someone to talk to?
The root of any user-based databases is a personnal information; (email/loggin/password). If it is deleted any linked data become unusable and anonymous and will end up deleted to reduce the DB size and clear indexes
It‚Äôs weird that people here support poor account security.
I for one am glad that companies require ID to close accounts. I‚Äôd be so angry if someone managed to hack it and literally delete hundreds of pounds worth of gameplay on a whim.

It‚Äôs perfectly legal for companies to ask for ID in Europe, it is illegal to share that information.

Blizzard might be doing something scummy but it‚Äôs standard business practice in EU and not just for games companies.
I'm more bothered with your reasoning here, which is still flawed. Why would they need proof when you pay? I don't get your logic here.
This ain‚Äôt the EU
>  I don't quite get why you don't consider legal documents with your name and birthdate on it as proof.

_That_ is proof, but not the name and birth date you made when signing up. Then they don't care much because they want you to play their games. There is an asymmetry in proof and obstacles here. I'm not discussing the risk of account stealing here, but that they present artificial hurdles on account termination. IIRC this is in violation to GDPR. If they made it equally hard to sign up where you had to submit your driver license after purchasing their game to even play them, I'd be fine with it.
Really? Now I‚Äôm curious, in what unit of temperature is that possible? Celsius would be even more ridiculous, Kelvin would be way in the opposite direction, and those are the ones that come to mind off the top of my head.
>Neither of these are proof of them doing anything intentionally. Their servers are getting absolutely fucked.

Aren't the photo ID's checked manually? That's why they don't go through instantaneously. I'd guess that a refusal would therefore not have anything to do with the amount of server stress.
They just rejected my passport because i blacked out some information. There you have it.
I don‚Äôt think the buyers don‚Äôt have sense per say, it‚Äôs more like the fear of missing out. Putting the words ‚Äúlimited‚Äù or ‚Äúlegendary‚Äù or ‚Äúsuper extra rare diamond gold edition‚Äù will spark some form of artificial value which people more vulnerable to compulsive purchasing will inevitably fall for it.
Yea but then they wouldn't even have the cheap plastic figurines.
~~items~~ ~~pixels~~ polygons
Where I live you can't get a decent pair of Jeans for less than 100. A simple button down will easily run you 50. 

So 50 for several ig items is cool by me
Blizzard made the character LGBT after the fact to score some woke points anyways. It's just one comic. They are shitty either way.
I mean, they are a corporation and their primary objective is profit. If they'd concentrate on just making games that wouldn't be that bad. But instead, they decided to do politics but not where it matters only where their message is 100% socially acceptable and wouldn't affect the bottom line.
Welp, thats definitely a different perspective than my own. Is the ecosystem of "non-blizzard" professionals going for work very large? I'm unknowledgable on this.

I think I get what you are saying, but am generally of the opinion that opening up things to a very broad spectrum of people is actually always a good thing and we should be striving for it more everywhere and *especially* in the gaming world.

Obviously people have to be paid to run the event. But i think $50-$100 for a weekend visitor is fair and would cover costs. Also, I'm more of the opinion that because of, as you mentioned, *how much blizzard makes from people just playing their games*, they should actually be more inclined to, you know, *give back* to the community that supports them.

So thats kind of where I'm coming from. No stake in the game btw. I'm not involved in the Blizzard community in any way at all, so I will admit I probably have an outside perspective. I don't want to make claims about things I'm unknowledgeable about, hopefully that at least comes across.
It has nothing to do with China because they made NO policy changes since this China thing happened. This has been their policy for years.
So you‚Äôre okay with twitter banning conservatives and reddit making t_d a private sub? I mean it‚Äôs their website so they can do what they want right?
But he didn't
What is your ‚Äúwhat‚Äù?  

Capitalism bad is how blizzard got here. 

Government good is how China got there.
No need. There is no US state or federal law that makes it a crime for a corporation to not make a profit or increase it yearly. Nobody goes to jail if their corporation doesn‚Äôt make a profit.
So you made it up.
Oh come on. You need to learn to back down when you are wrong. Digging your heels in is a bad look.

It's OK to be wrong.
Ah. I see.  I must have missed this natural law in school.  :)
NoT rEaL cOMmuNiSm

Fascism is just a subset of authoritarian communism. There are "private" companies but not really, as the state dictates what they can or cannot do. There is no private property protection, means of production is effectively owned by the state. There are effectively no economic liberties, and there sure as hell arent any civil liberties.
You could literally change nothing except the last word to communist and it would suddenly make sense.
This is like saying to someone who has cancer that their entire body is a failure. Maybe instead of attacking the entire body, you attack the cancer. 

The cancer is totalitarianism... obviously...
Yeah, i got that. But the guy is being downvoted, so it make's it look like he is calling both dumb.
That‚Äôs not a post made by Blizzard. I don‚Äôt understand why people think this.
Unreasonable. They cannot ask for you ID, since that has no weight in deciding whether you own the account.

Withdrawing your consent should be at least as easy as giving it.

Article 6 (excerpt) 
> Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes;

Article 7 (excerpt) 
> It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.

Article 17 (excerpt) 
> The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay where one of the following grounds applies: [‚Ä¶] (b) the data subject withdraws consent on which the processing is based according to point (a) of¬†Article 6(1), or point (a) of¬†Article 9(2), and where there is no other legal ground for the processing;
I can hear them now

Ok but let's not take the conspiracy too far.
It's even more incredible if you consider he's not a woman!
I mean we're just going to have to agree to disagree here.

Your account wasn't worth potentially several thousand dollars when you made it and represent 15 years or more of your gaming history and achievements.

I don't think it's draconian or anything, but by all means raise hell about it. If it matters to you it matters to you and I won't tell you you're wrong.
Yes. Can we write letters?
EU law states that deleting an account can't be any harder than it was to set one up.
>	Why would they need proof when you pay? I don‚Äôt get your logic here.

Are you kidding me? Have you never heard of credit card fraud?
XD I wasn't using that system, just estimating the high point for Farenheit because I don't use high ranges of it really ever. Save cooking, which I rarely do.

Yes, definitely
Yes he did.
The people, their spending power. That's what. --If they would collectively get their heads out of ass first.
These dumb kids on Reddit have no idea what they are talking about. "Legally bound to increase profit yearly." That is something a teenager says who thinks he knows how the world works would say because they don't know anything about anything.

Ask anybody, literally any adult running a business what their accountant tells them about making a profit each year. Christ the stupid here is unbelievable.
I really hope these are 10 year old kids that think this. Hell my 6th grader knows better.
They often are replaced though.

Example: The Coach of a sports team
Let me be the one to tell you about a cool different kind of legal obligation called a "Civil Suit."
Made what up?
What do you mean?
If its authoritarian, its not communist. Its a totalitarian govt that is faking communist ideals. Soviet Union is an example of a totalitarian regime disguising itself as communist.
Fascism is politically as far away from communism as possible, although communism has been corrupted to be essentially fascism with a different name.
* authoritarian 
* communism

Pick one
The means of production are in people's possession? No

The means of production are in a state of transition to being controlled by the people? No.

Goods are distributed among the population according to the needs of each person? No.

There are social classes? Yes, in 2018 China had the second-highest number of billionaires in the world: 285.

The communist party is transitioning to a system were the ultimate goal is to eliminate any kind of political party inside China? No.

The communist party is at least trying to promote this transition? No.

The figure of "private property" exists in China? Yes.

Chinese people are entitled to have properties? Tricky one. Not everyone, but anyone is entitled to have properties outside China. Just ask the canadians. Therefore, chinese people can own property.

International corporations own properties inside China? Yes.

Why someone seriously think that China is a communist country is beyond me. Can only assume that this is based on pure ignorance. China is as communist as Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a democratic people's republic.
You should try your thinking head because your commenting head doesn't work very well, it writes a lot of really stupid bullshit.
You clearly have absolutely no understanding of communism. You literally wrote "means of production is effectively owned by the state".

This is a joke comment, right?
Is he wrong though?
Except, they are dumb.
It's by the Chinese Hearthstone account. Hearthstone is owned by Blizzard.
Article 12.6:

> Without prejudice to Article 11, where the controller has reasonable doubts concerning the identity of the natural person making the request referred to in Articles 15 to 21, the controller may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm the identity of the data subject.
I did say "risk".  When you flash ID in a local exchange there is little danger of data retention.   Sending a picture of your ID to a company is a whole different ball game.   The company may have good intentions, but the hundreds of data breaches that happen every year should make everyone think twice before transmitting an ID.
That has nothing to do with conspiracies, just being conscious about data you give away for no good reason. Companies have demonstrated enough times that your data isn't safe.
I appreciate any extra security - that's warranted, and isn't a blatant overreach only being used to prevent a mass exodus of accounts.

My WoW account was created back in 2005, so I know what it means to have all of that lost.
So to counter it, we start sending in our ID every time we use our credit card? Your logic is still flawed. If blizzard wants to keep customers happy, it makes more sense to make actions which might piss off customers harder for a third party to do. Someone adding money to my account will not piss me off.
Tell me, why does Blizzard need my Dutch social security number to delete my account?
Goodwill does not exist in Norway.
You know buying cheap shit means you have to rebuy it every so often cause it‚Äôs cheap and tears , breaks and is ruined much faster then more expensive and sturdier clothing
Not as low as assuming I live where you live.

I live in Norway where the cost of living is relatively high, but the wages are high to match. But since Norway is such a small nation Blizzard doesn't change prices to match. So 50 euros for a several in game rewards that each would cost between 12 and 20 euros? That's a bargain any way you slice it.
Welp I may not agree with you on the topic of this post but at least you‚Äôre consistent. It‚Äôs actually refreshing. lol have a good one
He showed support for HK, that does not violate any TOS.
Ok? It‚Äôs still not a law.
So does that happen automatically every time a corporation doesn‚Äôt increase year over year profits? Even though the corporation made every best effort? Or maybe that happens when shareholders feel like they can prove in civil court, where the bar is lower than criminal court, that the corporation didn‚Äôt try to make a profit?

And when did anyone go to jail when losing a civil suit?
communism ALWAYS leads to an authoritarion dictatorship. What do you think, that people willingly will give up their possessions and freedoms? Even Karl Marx recognized this and stated that all communist societies start with a violent revolution. Keeping it communist also requires a ruler with a firm hand. 'this is not real communism'  is a false claim because what you see in communist countries IS what real communism looks like or at least always ends up like.
Its not. Fascism is a centrist ideology in terms of economics, between communism and capitalism. But the main driver of whether or not something is on the left or right side of the scale is ownership of property. In communism, property is collectively owned. In capitalism, property is privately owned. In Fascism, property is said to be privately owned, but it is effectively owned by the collective because the state can determine what you do with the property, and can seize the property if you dont do what they want.
Is it too much to ask for both?
Is the state not "the people"? It essentially is the same thing, its the representative of the collective.

China effectively has no private property. You can call it private if you want, it isnt.

None of those other things matter in defining whether something is communist or not. It all comes down to property ownership.
The point of ownership is to determine who can say what to do with it, right?
No, the guy iterating Irony two two people for being the same level of idiot isn't dumb, he is just emphasising how stupid these people are.
It was posted by the NetEase PlayHearthstone account on the Sina Weibo platform in response to the ruling by Blizzard Taiwan.

This social network and this company are based in Mainland China where the Chinese government controls the media. In the comments you will mostly see anti-protester sentiment as a result.
They cannot use that data to confirm your identity. Knowing your ID does not improve their ability to link you with your data, since they don't know it yet.
Fretex?
I've lived and worked in Norway before. There's plenty of good jeans for 400-500 NOK (45-55 USD). Unless you're some kind of soy boy who needs specific brand slim fit jeans to match your overpriced supreme sweater or whatever.
Ok? You can get like 15+ shirts from goodwill for that same $50 so even if they need to be replaced more often it's still a much better deal, especially for someone struggling financially
Yeah I‚Äôm pretty centre left, I just disagree with him using blizzard as his political platform.
He was fired for tos violation, maybe do some research into the argument you‚Äôre trying to make.
No breach of fiduciary duty is if the CEO or board of directors takes actions that knowingly or willfully damage stock valuation. Rarely is a suit brought over accidental devaluation. There's a difference between a somewhat risky business decision & actions that WILL devalue the stock.

A good example is Dick's with their removal of "assault weapons" and now the CEO is wanting to remove all HUNTING products from their stores. Acts like this definitely devalued the stock & would make good grounds for a breach of fiduciary duty lawsuit.
Whether or not you go to jail is completely irrelevant to the definition of a legal code. You're arguing for the sake of arguing and you look really stupid.
off the top of my head the zapatistas, rojava region, and catalonia are all examples of communist states that had no centralized political party and focused on maximizing personal freedom. im quite certain there are more.
Literally? Yes.
No, the state is not the people, it's not the same thing, not even close in China today. And even if you accept that, the fact that the State isn't forwarding the process to become truly communist (with things like extinguishing political parties and eliminating social classes that doesn't exist in communism) is a strong sign that the country isnt' communist. They're not even trying to be.

About private property:

" The current PRC Constitution, as most recently amended in 2004, clearly provides for the protection of ‚Äúprivate property.‚Äù According to Article 13 of the Constitution, citizens‚Äô lawful private property is ‚Äúinviolable.‚Äù The same article also states: ‚Äú\[t\]he state, in accordance with law, protects the rights of citizens to private property and to its inheritance.‚Äù"

Again, I can only assume that you've never read The Communist Manifesto if you think the other points are meaningless to define if a country is communist or not. You should try at least skim the main topics of the book, to grasp the concept of what is communism, its not something self-declared.
Oh thanks for clearing that up. The way I read your last comment was that he was in the wrong for calling the two people dumb
I would assume they‚Äôre matching against the name or address on the credit card you used for purchases.  I‚Äôd also bet that if you have no purchases and you contacted via the email associated with the account, they would just delete your account without requiring further validation
No. I need Diesel and Lee because its the only thing that fits my fat ass. 

Legit tho. I have never seen a decent pair of Jean's for less than  900nok. Like denim jeans. The last time I bought cheap ones for around 400nok i threw them out in less than 6 months. While my 1000nok Diesels last me 2+ years.
I‚Äôm not saying that everyone needs to buy expensive clothes but if you‚Äôre not struggling financially it‚Äôs always going to be a better option to buy clothes in the middle range when it comes to prices.

There‚Äôs a reason stuff is cheap, not to mention a lot of people would not feel comfortable wearing clothes that once belonged to someone else.

As I said, if you really are struggling off your options are very limited, but buying a 15$ pair of shoes is always going to be a Bad investment
It is what it is honestly. Blizzard blew this up to where it is, whatever fallout they receive is on them.
‚Äúbrings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard‚Äôs image.‚Äù Because saying that people should not be allowed to be kidnapped by a dictatorship at anytime definitely damages there image, makes the player unreputable, and offends the CPC, a group that really should be respected for their numerous humanitarian actions.
Please provide a source for an instance when some CEO was held liable for stock devaluation that wasn't tied to an instance of fraud or corruption.  
When doing something like Dick's did, or what Blizzard *could have* done, the defense of "protecting brand reputation for long term stability" is pretty solid. PR is important, and "knowingly and willfully" is pretty hard to prove, especially when they can say they were trying to avoid PR nightmares like Blizzard is having now.
Incorrect.

&#x200B;

  it's when the board of directors do something that's adverse or contrary to the interests of the client .

Interest of the client is in their corporate charter.

&#x200B;

" Acts like this definitely devalued the stock "

Speculation. I will now shop at Dick's pretty exclusively for camping/sports items.  


That aside, buy doing the right thing, that may give the access to capital from institutions that value Dick's decision.

Dick's Charter, and pretty much all others, specifically calls out risks and impacts that may decrease money, and changes in inventory are among them. 

&#x200B;

Have you even read a corporate charter of a large organization?
Sure. That‚Äôs not a law.
Nah, the stupid one would be the one regurgitating corporate propaganda. Maximizing profits at the expense of anything resembling morality isn't a legal obligation, no matter how you frame it.

This shit just comes bundled with "Why Unions Are Bad?" to justify exploitation at all costs, when it has no basis in reality.
Except their is NO LAW to do that.

Fiduciary duty mean staying in line with the corporate charter. In it's entirety.
Please explain the difference between ‚Äúlegal code‚Äù and ‚Äúlaw‚Äù. OP said it was a law, which is clearly misstating how corporations operate.
Catalonia is not communist and those other examples are not really what i consider and advocate for communism.
You‚Äôre joking right? None of these are even stand alone countries... the first one has like 3k farmers in its so called region that is a part of Mexico. The second one is absolutely an extremely authoritarian government. And the third one is a region of Spain which is more significantly closer to capitalist than it is to communist. I hope the first 3 weren‚Äôt your best 3 because that‚Äôs pretty shitty
It‚Äôs just a meme
He is half wrong, because I don't believe one of them are dumb, but the other is very.
That's a very fair point. I updated my original comment to reflect that!
That's just wholeheartedly not true though. You can make assumptions and have your privilege make you ignorant, but there's plenty of quality clothes to be found at those places. I've bought pants and shirts that have looked like they were never even worn (and if they were it was once or twice at most) I spent $20 on a pair of shoes a year and a half ago that I currently have on my feet, and no I don't look like a ragged homeless person I look like an average mid 20's dude. Most of those places like goodwill won't even accept and sell clothes that have holes or are too worn down. Idk if you've just had a poor experience at one of these places or are just woefully misinformed, but you don't know what you're talking about.
The media and the fans blew it out. They just made a publicity move, it‚Äôs always a gamble and I guess they chose wrong.
His dragging his political opinions into a gaming tournament offends the public and brings the company into disrepair.
Blizzard is a publicly traded company. Not one mans diary.

If he wants to make political statements he can make them in his own personal time.

I agree with you, China bad, dictators bad but that has nothing to so with this guy breaking the rules and being banned.
And that‚Äôs still not a law. It‚Äôs a civil matter at worst.
I'm hilariously anti-corporate, don't build up a straw man in your mind. That's why it's so important that you recognize that corporate "greed" is borne from a legal obligation to the shareholders. Until that precedent is addressed, nothing will change.
[i'm referring to catalonia during the 30s, which was absolutely 100% communist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia)

and the zapatistas and rojava region meet pretty much every criteria, both theoretically and in practice, of communist societies. if you're saying they aren't great places to live? well yeah, they're in impoverished, violent areas - cartels surround the zapatistas, and rojava is fighting against ISIS. but theyve managed to drastically improve the quality of life for people living there, with the zapatistas kicking the cartel out and rojava kicking ISIS out.
*sighs.

i've literally never encountered someone who described rojava as authoritarian before, so i guess you're the first. they have no leaders. decisions are made via direct democracy. and theyre secular. so i'm not really seeing, at all, how theyre authoritarian. it sort of seems like you're either not familiar with them, at all, or you're just making shit up.

catalonia in the 30s was pretty much as textbook communist as you can get...? [here's a link where you can learn about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_Catalonia). 

there are about 300-400k people living in the zapatista region. which is a few orders of magnitude higher than what you said.

like i told the other guy. it is OK not to know things. that's fine. but you seem to be just making shit up. everything you said is demonstrably false, with the exception of catalonia, which i suspect you didn't know about.

again, i'm not advocating for communism, i'm simply refuting the point that communism leads to authoritarianism every time.
Your entire argument is anecdotal at best.

You‚Äôve bought a bunch of stuff and got lucky, you found great quality clothes at  facility that revolves around donations.

I have spent money and purchased things in places like goodwill, just not in America, and I can understand how sometimes you can find hidden gems, but it‚Äôs not the norm.

Not to mention your entire argument goes out the window when it comes to people with weird body types that need very specific cut on clothes.
I could never ever buy a cheap button up shirt cause my shoulders are wide but I‚Äôm skinny, and cheap button ups are not fitted in any way and make look like a tent, or any kind of pants cause I‚Äôm tall but my waist is small
Yeah they did.
[deleted]
Blizzard is the one offending the public. Their company has been in disrepair for a long while.

Blizz had the opportunity to do the right thing and not bend over for the CCP.

But they did. No amount of "bUt TOs!" will save their image after this. That's what it was intended to do, no? Keep their image clean?
There is no legal obligation. Find any statute, civil or criminal, in any US state or federal code, that says a corporation must increase profits year over year or else they are automatically subject to legal action.

At best it would be a civil contract dispute in which the plaintiff would have to get a judge or jury to believe that the corporation had violated a contract and should pay a civil, monetary penalty to the plaintiff. But that is not codified law in any statute anywhere.
So why is catalonia no longer communist if it was that great of a system.  And yes communism if better than anarchy or a religious fascist dictatorship, that doesn't make it a good system, that makes it better than the worst possible thing. Soviet russia was also better for most people than the terrible monarchy they had before it but that's not saying much.
Lol. That wiki doesn‚Äôt really help your cause. Join the collective or else is pretty much the gist of it. 
I suppose if your catholic we might just take your church and turn it into a factory, unless it‚Äôs cold out, maybe we‚Äôll burn it down. Don‚Äôt worry, we are gonna torture you and kill you afterwards anyways so what does it matter. No big deal. See that‚Äôs how communism works. You either wholly support it or you‚Äôre gonna end up pretending to after we kill several thousand people in your community. A lot of people might say ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt like it leave‚Äù that‚Äôs a swell idea except for the fact that they ‚Äúdecentralized‚Äù not just the government, but also the money! Here‚Äôs your weakly pay of 100 southwest section 2-1 dollars, spend it here because it‚Äôs only for this region and no one will exchange it...


Real shining star of non-authoritarian communism. 


As for the the Zapatistas region of Mexico, yes I made a mistake. 3000 is the number of active participants in a region of 350,000ish people. With a gdp of $44 million U.S. and most of its population (probably excluding the leadership but that‚Äôs just an assumption admittedly) living in poverty how would you consider that a success story? The most likely reason The Mexican government didn‚Äôt go in and squash that movement when it started is probably to avoid a civil war over $44 mil a year... which I‚Äôd guess they still take a cut out of anyways, but either was they still have a $1+ trillion gdp so it‚Äôs still irrelevant to them. 

I suppose you‚Äôre right here for now, but considering it‚Äôs not actually it‚Äôs own country, and it‚Äôs still a poor rural lightly populated area it‚Äôs kind of a moot point


As for Rojava you claim it‚Äôs not authoritarian, I guess imprisoning journalists who are critical of your government is pretty normal for a communist government so I can see how you make the mistake that it is not that bad. Sure they are helping us fight the IS in Syria, but that doesn‚Äôt mean their government is not authoritarian...  it‚Äôs mutually beneficial to both the U.S. and the Kurds to remove a group that would like nothing more than to wipe out both societies. The allegiance of the U.S. doesn‚Äôt grant them legitimate non authoritarian status, next you‚Äôll be telling me Saudi Arabia is as free as they can get. don‚Äôt forget the forced Kurdish assimilation thats pretty legit way to run your‚Äùcountry.‚Äù(no other country recognizes their claim as an autonomous state)you can just google it. It‚Äôs not hard at all, most of it‚Äôs within the first couple paragraphs on wiki.  You might even find a few dozen articles about it. Or are they making it up too?! Damn why didn‚Äôt I think of that. 


All in all you maybe have a small point about Zapatista, but not really. The best score I can give you is maaaaybe a 0.2/3 being as generous as I can.
MY argument is anecdotal? Ok dude and yours totally isn't. Not to mention I said it's company policy to not sell shitty clothes yet you still think they do, hand-me-downs and donations aren't the same thing and shitty holey shirts. I haven't found "hidden gems" the shit I've bought absolutely is the norm, it's not name brand designer quality shit but you'd have to be and idiot to think you'd find that there. Have fun in your ignorance and strawman arguments I'm not gonna argue with stupid.
They would have probably gotten similar amount of backlash from the right if they had gone he other way
That is true but conjecture and nothing to do with the issue being debated here.
so we've moved the goalposts a whole bunch here. you said "there are no examples of non authoritarian communist societies" and i provided 3 off the top of my head. 

>So why is catalonia no longer communist if it was that great of a system. 

are you unfamiliar with what happened with spain and fascism in the 30s and 40s? i'm happy to teach you history and poli sci up to a point, but...i literally already linked it for you. the fascists took over and killed a shit ton of people. 

it's OK to not know about things, but youre spouting opinions stuff that you clearly know nothing about. when objectively corrected, you've moved the goalposts repeatedly.

ultimately the point i was making here was not arguing for communism, but refuting the argument that communism = authoritarianism every time, like you said.
you'll forgive if i don't pursue this further, as you clearly didn't know about any of the 3 governments until i brought them up and you quickly made some stuff up. again, i'm **not taking a pro-communism position here**, but refuting the obviously wrong statement that communism always leads to authoritarianism. 

your strategy has consisted entirely of 1) not knowing what things are 2) when you learn what things are, making shit up, and 3) moving the goalposts when you're pegged to a position that you now know is wrong. 

if you are passionate about opposing authoritarianism, as i am, it is important to argue in good faith. people are usually able to spot bad faith arguments and immediately discredit everything you're saying, even if it is to support a good cause.

it's also a bit telling in how confident you are with your points that you created a throwaway account. these are topics that i have formally studied for years while you didn't want your ignorance of them tied to your main account.

i hope you have a wonderful day.
Blizz feels they're in the right. A lot of the world, and the consumers and creators that drive the industry, disagree. Seems pretty clear to me. 

Nobody is saying Blizzard's TOS *can't* be interpreted that way, we're saying *it shouldn't, and we won't do business with a company that would*
Fair enough!
Everything I said is made up. Taken directly from Wikipedia, which was your source. Makes sense.  I hope that you didn‚Äôt spend a whole lot of money trying to learn what an authoritarian state is. Catalonia absolutely was, and Rojava absolutely is authoritarian.   I‚Äôll kind of give you Zapatista but really only on the basis of no one having any real ability to do anything significant there between its extremely poor economy and the fact it‚Äôs still technically part of Mexico. 

Take care, it was fun arguing with someone who‚Äôs only counterpoint is ‚Äúyou made it up‚Äù lol
Blizzard is indifferent, they‚Äôre staying out of it.

"There are dozens of us"
According to PCgamer

It's a bit ominous.¬†

The protesters have given out a lot of shirts and stickers so far, but most people are walking around them to get to security. There are police in the area, but like the convention employees they are completely ignoring the protesters.¬†

Can someone get me a free shirt?
Im proud of all the people who protested at blizzcon
Good, don't let that half-assed apology stand.
Any1 saying this controversy has had no effect is silly. I know a number of people who dropped wowclassic and canceled their subs. Myself included. They have definitely been affected
Quick reminder Meis voice actor was bullied and harassed for daring to post that she loves her country of China.
Well, it has begun.
Yeah but like ... some of the people i talked to thought about going back because of the stuff they announced.   
It's like they did it on purpose (banning him )so that we'll quickly forget about it again because of Blizzcon
...and the CCP bot farm descends.
There's literally one user (right now) down voting all of the comments that side with the protestors.

I will restore your points. His power means nothing.
Wow like 6 people protesting
Thanks for supporting hong kong
Yeah, Blizzard basically asked for this.
I don't get it. Where's the snow?
holy shit dude thats awesome there are still protesters there thats amazing
10-20 People demonstrating is "today at blizzcon". I have guild friends there and they did not even notice them...
Oh wow the president actually apologized, I'm surprised
The apology made during the opening did not address the facts and did not state what Blizzard wants to do next time something similar happens.

D4 trailer was cool, but there is still a bad taste in the mouth.
HongKonger here. Thanks for your support to the HK protest!
Meh, the show was a success and the hype they brought today already got more than half the kids off this bandwagon.
I want one of these shirts
The "free HK" protest has had no effect on blizzard community what so ever. The large community are still playing their games and could care less. Simple search on you tube and their main channel just proves the large majority of people just don't care. Im seeing a lot of content creators making more videos about blizzard and their stand on this shit show but 100k online protesters vs 11.5M people who are still playing, its not gonna work. They need to find another route or its just gonna die.
I played Overwatch from day 1 and I have deleted my account. Its not much, but they won't get my play hours and I will never spend another dollar on anything they have a hand in.
Yep, that was about as expected.
Blizzard did apologize. [link to full apology](https://youtu.be/CscJ58tRcEo)

Personally, I will wait and see what they actually DO to follow that up.  I'll definitely get on Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 if they make true amends, otherwise my wallet remains shut and my account remains logged out.
It begins.
Ok cool but overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 boyeeee!!!
I still love blizzard! Can't wait for shadowlands!
this wasnt about china.

it was about censoring people.

i hope the people of hong kong win their freedom also. i think trump should stop being a little bitch and go crazy cowboy, and help hong kong also.

sometimes you need a crazy cowboy in the driver seat.

point is, dont try to censor people in america, unless you want a fight.
Good, all I‚Äôve been hearing out of blizzcon is people excited for their new games. No!!! They announced these to get us of their back. Don‚Äôt give in.
Aw man I want a shirt
This does put a smile on my face
Damn.... I want one of those shirts so bad.
I kind of wish I could get one of those shirts.
Thank you
Where are these t-shirts made though.
That truck is an oxymoron
This Blizzcon was probably the best thing to happen o Blizzard. So many huge announcements people kind of seem to be like ‚ÄúHong Kong who?‚Äù
That does put a smile on my face
Doesn't the slogan "Mei with Hong Kong" sound a bit casually racist?
atlest 10 people have to dress up as chinese/hongkong riot police so it can be a real protest.
If I‚Äôm going to blizzcon why would I waste time and energy on protestors ? I support Hong Kong but I‚Äôm there to enjoy the new games and atmosphere.

I already called it that gamers and the internet have a memory of a goldfish. Blizzard stocks are up and blizzard, Hong Kong etc arnt top subreddits for a while now. It‚Äôs not black and white like so many of these guys think it is.
DIABLO 4
So like 6 nerds standing outside doing jack shit? About the extent of slactivism I‚Äôd expect from redditors.
Should they also protest for all the whistle blowers in the US recently that have been detained and prosecuted?
Anyone who paid to go to Blizzcon probably does not care what happens in China.
Lmao
I would love a shirt. Is there a way to get one shipped?
all news reports say it  was over 30 protestors 

so basically no one

you can now shut up about hong kong and blizzard because you clearly don't care
Here we go
I like Blizzard so much more now
Wasting time with that shit, d4 hype
Yeah luckily it was all way outside beyond security.
Can someone send me a free T-Shirt in UK?
Oh I want one!
Good
good.
Lol they're killing Mei in this video 100% FREE HK punishment
Would be cool if people brought the protest to the front of a blizzard HQ and not a convention where people are just trying to enjoy a game they like.
Sure showed them.
Lmao sure China cares about the opinions of a bunch of pasty white losers
Lol y'all are dumb.

You already know you'll be buying the new D4 game and playing that. You're all hypocrites.

And Blizzard won't change.
Today at Blizzcon what, there were maybe 20 people at any given time who were making fools out of themselves. What Blizzard did wasn't wrong, they were just idiots about how they did it because you jackassess like a good drama shitstorm. Considering absolutely nothing appears about Hong Kong on r/popular anymore and considering that pretty much every post on this sub is about Blizzard justifiably banning a guy who decided to make a controversial political statement on an event that was about gaming, I'll say you morons will milk this cow for a long time after it dies.
It's such a shame that all of the games they've been working so hard on have had their development timeline pushed back two years.
What do people on the other side yell? 

China is one? 

HK is china? 

hand over HK?
van with the word freedom democracy written on the side, hmmm
I want a free Hong Kong shirt now.
*Today is gonna be ok
Protesting an abusive and repressive state, while standing in and participating in another abusive and repressive state.... so dope.
So not shit
Blizzard must have felt SO awkward a few weeks ago when people started using Mei as a protest figure, when she's a pretty significant part of the new short.
/r/wow and /r/overwatch unfortunately dont seem to care. And if they announce D4, I doubt others would too ):
So in other words, a drop of water in the ocean as the fish swim where they want to go.
can someone get me a shirt pls :(
Thank you very much!!!!!!!
If anyone is there, or if you are one of the protestors, I'd love to get a shirt.  Get in touch.
Until they announced Diablo now all of a sudden everyone forgot.
We need to send liberty prime to Hong Kong. Let's see Chinese paid police officers hit him with tear gas.
How do I get myself a free free hk shirt?
Change team
So glad to see this happened.
They should be protesting the crappy game reveals too!
Hopefully the handout is going well. Is it ?
Can i get a free t shit ?
Brexit lol
So it's going EXACTLY the way everyone expected.
Free HK bros
Odds of Mei getting banned??? üòê
Woah, a petition? Sign Me(i) up
I new there had to be some who would spoil it  take your protests some where els
But they released OW2, a Co-Op game which seems really fun! Anyways, they still deserve that for supporting China.
Lol sad
I want a free T-shirt!
Golly that seems well-funded.
As long as they aren't messing with anyone or ruing their fun, i'm cool with this...
This post help the CCP becous it genrated money for Reddit wich then goes to China.
Ahh good
I need a shirt,sadly I‚Äôm in germany
What ever happened to boycotting this event?
Wow, there are like a dozen of them.  

Looks like the boycott is going well too with Diablo, Overwatch and WoW now trending.

It's a wonderful sentiment but has sadly accomplished nothing.
And they accomplished almost nothing, as per the sjw usual preformance
I want a t shirt
These are amazing! To stand with hk is important in the sense that the spreading ccp influence on the free world would harm your personal benefits too! Some of the senators who have close relationship with ccp are already abandoning the interest of the U.S. citizens for their own good. Hk is a perfect example of how sad it could be if you do business with ccp who has no integrity at all! So boycott blizzard and other companies which kneel down when they can actually defend!
not sure you know what a nihilist is if you think you can label someone that based on whether or not they play video games
Granted blizzard handled this poorly but I think people dont give enough consideration to certain points.

Firstly, all competitive esports players in a blizzard tournament will have signed a contract. That contract has clauses in it prohibiting players from making political comments or statements. If you break your contract then you risk facing the consequences of that contract.

Secondly, I cant think of a single way blizzard could have handled this that would have been considered amicable. Theres a level of hiprocrasy from people who are now deciding to stop buying blizzard products. The realities of the Chinese government have been known for years, recent blizzard games have been produced using the money earnt from chinese sales. 

Where was your protest 2 or 3 years ago, or when China started rounding up Muslims. Why did you continue to support blizzard then, and by contrast; why is it that  a relatively unknown hearthstone player eating the consequences of breaking his contract  became the thing that pushed you into action.

If you want to stop buying blizzard products that's fine but dont kid yourself that it makes any difference. China makes all the computer chips in your TVs, computers and consoles. You wont go an entire day without using or handling something made in China. We support the chinese government every day. 

This protest is dumb, I was really disgusted with blizzard when this initially came out. Watching it all unfold however, the protesters make me sympathise with blizzard so much more.
[removed]
This wasn't a protest this was an "Awareness Rally" which Is still admirable.
Kinda depressing, everyone is talking about the d4 announcement around me and every single time I have mentioned how I doubt blizz can actually do it, the conversation becomes about Blizz.. and it turns out nobody had ANY idea about what happened. Never heard of it. I even got someone who had no idea what was happening in HK.
All from 23 to 35 years old btw..
what an a mei zing protest.

&#x200B;

so much mei in the ow2 trailer too
this post is more popular than the china blizzard flag one and i love it
Diablo 4 and suddenly everyone forgives and forgets. You watch.

We shall see.
This is probably about as big as the Area 51 raid. Congrats to all 20 people involved...
Today at blizzcon idiots gather outside to be annoying in a vain attempt of moral inflation as they think they're helping when in fact they are as helpful as sandpaper in a desert
I'm curious what they think they are going to accomplish here... I think absolutely nothing.  It seems like another example of LARPing as pretend revolutionaries and then they go back home and play WoW Classic in their bedroom.
[removed]
lol like 50 protesters showed up hahahahaa
Until Blizzard apologizes and stops being China's lapdog let's stop buying their games.

And we shouldn't accept any "both sides are good" apologies either. China is corrupt, ignoring Hong Kong's right to self government, and American companies have no morals if they ally with a totalitarian state like China.
I'm here now for a totally different reason can't participate. But it's feels like for every person in the handful of protesters, there's about a few hundred folks super psyched about BlizzCon. I'm not saying that the protest shouldn't happen. Kinda hoped it would be bigger.
What worthless hypocrites.  Protesting for freedom & democracy for HK, while protesting free speech & capitalism at home & they're shocked, SHOCKED when they see HKers posting Trump memes as a sign of freedom.
> Today **outside** Blizzcon

FTFY

Seriously, if the HK protesters had the brains of this lot they'd have tried to protest in the suburbs.
Crowd, disperse! They announced overwatch 2 and diablo 4. So uhhhhhhhhhhh how do I get my Blizzard account back?
guys how do I reactivate my blizzard account? my anti blizzard memes aren't getting upvotes and gold anymore.
You people really like to pretend that Blizzard is the cause of the HK protests,they acted based on their rules.A company like that has absolutely no reason to side with anyone or advicate for any social/political issue.Their purpose is to create entertainment.I would just like a world in wich all companies would stop pretending like they care.And i would argue that they have done more to bring people together than you give them credit for.People like Redditors like to force their hand but no good can come out of this.So you must do whatever you feel like is best for you and stop with the make yourself feel good comments.
And so it begins
Did blizzard America do this or was it blizzard China‚Äôs decision?
Ahaha yeeeeesss. This is going to be hilarious!
Cant wait for The Internet Historian to cover this
I legitimately thought they were going to kill Mei in the Overwatch 2 trailer.
Glad you guys pulled together
man, i really want that shirt. :/
All of 10 people that care? It is sad but not surprising in the least
What's this gonna do?
wow very brave
Virtue signaling
I'm glad this is still going on!
Mei's voice actor does NOT stand with those rioters. 
and the flag is the HK Chinese flag after handover by the white colonialists.
We are dozens! Dozens!
Liberate hong kong
Doesn't matter, everyone deleted their Blizzard accounts already, right?
Consumers.
Can you all stop with this propaganda bullshit. The extradition bill is gone, and the murderer walked away free. You "won"
BlizzCon has been awesome so far, where my D4 boys at?
Blizzard shaking rn
that diablo 4 trailer is making it hard for me to not be a complete piece of shit
Here is a support from Hong Kong . Even Hong Kong is likely going to be destroyed by Chinese CCP,  I hope America and the world are still free and resist Chinese company. In fact, Chinese gov itself cannot silence the world. It matters when all the people in the world stand up and resist. Those company cannot only make money from China because the Chinese market itself is relatively small compared to the World

Thank you!
What a turnout! Guess this is what they mean about that whole ‚Äúvocal minority‚Äù thing... When in an echo chamber do as the echo chamber does!
Fight for Freedom, Stand With Hong Kong.
Why you guys so stupid
Good. Im glad none of the announcements about new games are distracting people
Overwatch 2 and diablo 4 ain‚Äôt saving blizzard this time
I can see China absolutely shitting themselves a bunch of radicalized teens are being manipulated into protesting at a games company event.
This is a general reply to those people on this thread that are mocking people who object or protest Blizzard and their actions.

A thing people, like you, don't realize is that a lot of people that are against Blizzard's actions don't even live in the US or even had bought tickets. Do you honestly believe that all these people have time and money to fly to the US to protest outside a glorified advertisement? People have families, jobs, commitments. The only thing these people could possibly do is to stop giving Blizzard more money and delete their accounts. And then people like you shit on them for not standing by their convictions and 'showing' Blizzard. Those that attend these things obviously don't care about anything other than the games Blizzard makes/sells. People that object to CCP and Blizzard has already done what they can to distance themselves from them.
Protestors amass!!  Oh shit theres only like 5 of us.  Boy do we look dumb..
I was so angry while I watched the trailer on twitch, they even highlighted Mei in the trailer they give zero fucks. And the thousands of people in the hall listening to Kaplan made me sick. It was just a meme for most people,scum.
And we come to find out that after all that has happened over the past month, ultimately people do not care about Blizzard supporting China as long as they get the games they want.
I mean, I know they're protesting, I just keep not getting why are they using the colour of the government to be in favor of Hong Kong. "Freedom Democracy" with the colour of the dictatorship flag. I know it's a minor thing, but that's just so silly that they needed to pay just a little more attention to do that. Is not the best thing to use the colour of symbol of your enemy to protest against them. Yes, they tried to make Mei a symbol to make it illegal in China... Which didn't work and ended up just serving as marketing as everyone kept an eye to Blizzard and Blizzcon, making the announcements today have even more viewers and making more propaganda for them. 

After they reduced the penalties from the HS player (I forgot the name), the fuel of using Mei and other OW characters was just free marketing for blizzard. They just needed to stay silent and things would just settle down and in the end everything will be just the same as usual with maybe more people watching them and seeing they're launching new games.
Hk needs mainland China more than the other way
I am so so appreciate as a HKer. Thank you.

I love you, american.
Solidarity with Hong Kong!!!!!!!
Throw them all in jail.
It's always the few who make the most noise. Good to see people avoiding this Hong Kong crap and focusing more on the event.
[deleted]
I wonder how many people are there that don‚Äôt even know what blizzard is. But just wanna be part of the fad.
Pretty funny how only the first few rows are cheering.
Don't forget, *none of this is endorsed by Blizzard.*

In fact, Blizzard's stance is the exact *opposite* of this: they oppose democracy.
D4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =D
Weak ahaha
Oh yeah. Today he was a joke
im hoping this post wont get removed at all itll suck if it does
[deleted]
China's not going to like this. Better get on stage blizzard and issue an apology.
The vain ritual of protesting in the US. Every one returns home to their beds none the worse and having only given up a small fraction of their free time accomplishing nothing and breathing hot air. Meanwhile the very issue they want to "help" with sees no benefit from this empty notion because their thousands of miles away, but hey people on twitter took the time to post a sentence "in solidarity" and t-shirts were made. Boy, if that isn't insulting to those people who suffer at the hands of real tyranny in this world.
Ah yes, the hong Kong protests
Because waving American flags and believing that the US is free means rebellion
I'm sorry I understand this is for a good cause or whatever. But come on, this is a video game convention, not a politicon.
As a HongKonger really appreciate that .It mean a lot to know the world is standing with us
You showed them!
Such brave democracy fighters, we should be giving them trophies for their fight for freedom against evil Chinese oppression.
It's nice to see! Thank you all for not letting this blow over!
Blizzard asked for this and now they will get it. All 15 of those protesters should zerg rush the building. There will be at least 3 left by the end but just enough to raise awareness about King Kong
For those not seeing why this is good. This is the character from Blizzards game. Aka blizzard whom is making sure there image is pro China. Well if we take there character and turn it against them. Will China ban the game and the dev who pandered entirely to them? That would be just so sweet.
Why Mei? Just because she's fat and Chinese?

Why not Tracer who's a Brit?
Great choice in a mascot reddit geniuses. Mei voice actor is literally not for a free hong kong lol. Who would of guess though a reddotor didn't do any research. Past posting memes.
Cute
And nothing will change,now back to home to play overwatch
What a terrible protest. It just goes to show that liberals really have no idea how to protest because they're too busy wanting to be nice. You're supposed to go out there, disrupt shit, and put your body on the line. They should have been standing in front of doors and forming human chains to prevent people from getting in. They could block off hallways, too. Instead, they're just passing out shirts and looking awkward. No wonder no one gives a damn.

Also, so much for this Blizzard boycott, Lol.
Overwatch 2 is damage control, nothing else...
Well at least this people have more tegridy than most gamers
Hell yeah!
where did they get the truck
Keeps telling me to sign in with a google account when I‚Äôm on my YouTube account (which is a google account).
I would but someone is fapping into the mic.
This stream is pathetic.
4:41:10

lmao
Yo that‚Äôs the most effective shit
dozen*
Doesn‚Äôt really seem ominous. Just more business as usual.
The police will do nothing unless it becomes violent, the city already stopped by and gave the protesters their full support.
Per that article, it's grown a bit as the day's gone on to around 50 people. And interviews with people in the hall find them generally supportive of the protests, even if they're not, you know, letting it stop them from enjoying Blizzcon.
I would totally grab a t-shirt. Those look awesome.
The outside of any convention is political so people learn to ignore it no matter what it is
Checked it out at lunch, protestors kinda disappointing. A lot of people taking pics of cosplayers and you see the protestors all to themselves, everyone ignoring btw.  Really sad display...
I think you mean, it needs more support. Let‚Äôs go people!
Honestly not surprised at the end of the day people can only truly care about things that cause them suffering. Now the outrage is over the biggest problem is those who make them feel bad for liking a game.
I wouldn't call it ominous but a given that courting Blizzard supporters is going to result in not a lot of people wanting to rock the boat and openly protest inside by wearing a shirt/sticker. Do people who pay for Blizzcon entry want to immediately jump at the chance of, possibly, being asked to leave the event they paid for because they wore a protest shirt? Probably not. 

It's very important to still be there and be a constant reminder of what Blizzard stands for but expecting convention goers to jump on board en masse is probably asking too much.
There's nothing ominous about it. The protestors just aren't actively protesting anything. "Want a free Mei T-shirt? What size? Here you go." One guy tried yelling for a bit, but he seemed kinda at a loss, for what he wanted changed, or wanted people to do. There's no anger, or yelling, crying, etc, like we've all kinda gotten used to. Just here's a shirt dude, enjoy the con. They just as easily could of been handing out Diablo 4 shirts. 

They aren't actually blocking anything, so anyone actually walking on the sidewalk will naturally just walk past them. There's no detour here. Just stay on the sidewalk, and literally 10 feet later you're in the security check line.

At least the T-shirts were made in the USA. With them handing out thousands of them, it kinda turned into a gag. Like "I bet the shirts are all made in China."
The police isn‚Äôt ignoring us - We are in constant communication with Anaheim PD, to ensure everything goes smoothly and is done right.

No protestors is blocking anyone off, as that was one of our main values - We want to be heard, seen and hopefully understood - Not to cause disruption and frustration.

That‚Äôs also why you don‚Äôt see us inside chanting, disrupting whatsoever.
> It's a bit ominous.¬†

I can't stand it when redditors speak like this.
do they let people with those T shirts in ,do they check ? I guess they not letting them in even with tickets ?
Do protester have a permit outside the building?
Seriously, I'll take any free swag I can get, and if it's something positive that might help spread a message worth spreading then it's a win-win.

&#x200B;

its close. But i am sure EVERYONE is ripping these ideas off for a quick buck.

Edit: I was told these are probably made in China. Read the posting. Seller has u/ for designer and someone else. Can check their stuff. I'm not buying bit if you do you should look into it more sure.
I would love to have one of those shirts.
i need the shirt too!
I would love a free shirt
I also want what this man is requesting
This please
I‚Äôll take two
I mean free is free hahaha just in case
Yeah. They did so much to help Hong Kong. They sure showed China.
Awwwww. Love!
That‚Äôs right, I personally am boycotting blizzard, who‚Äôs games I enjoy very much, because they‚Äôre propping up totalitarian bullshit.
Not enough that millions of people won't buy Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2. Like it or not, those of us who are opposed to Blizzard's handling of the Hong Kong situation are still in the global minority. They will push millions of units and make billions of dollars from these two games regardless. It sucks, but that's the harsh reality of things.
I'm not convinced when all of Blizzard's new cinematic and trailers are dragging all over the front page, with every commenter frothing at the mouth and opening their wallet as soon as they see a new game, honestly. 

That's not to say that nobody is boycotting and that the movement isn't going to be at least somewhat effective, but there's one or two posts on the front page that's anti-blizzard, and about six that a pro-blizzard.
I deleted everything Blizzard and trashed all merch I have ever owned. They want to throw away the company by taking a stance against human rights? Well let me lend a hand ...
What's even more stupid is people who get mad for "bringing up politics".  Like yeah, Blizz did that first, that's part of why there is a protest.
I used to spend a decent amount of money in hearthstone, and now I‚Äôve deleted my act. My discord friends have done the same. A few acts may not seem like much but our combined efforts will make a difference.
Yep. I ended my time in Hearthstone and Diablo (long time fan, own all games), won't be back until Blizzard actively rescinds their choices. I guess if the Blitzchung ban ends after time served I will just have to boycott forever :c
Still playing wow classic. Bought virtual ticket. Will buy D4.
For real though. I know people who I never thought would care about these things drop it because of this
No appreciable effect*

There, y'all semantic nerds. You and your buds dropping out of a few subs ain't putting a dent in anything.
Has blizzard made a statement acknowledging it yet?
It had a marginal effect at most.

People were hyping up the protests to be something huge instead it's like a dozen people giving out free shirts that nobody in the actual convention is wearing.

No one cares, despite Reddit's delusion.
Was gonna get Warcraft 3 remastered but skipping, now. Not playing OW anymore, either.  
  
Am I going to make an impact on Blizzard? No but I just don't want to support their company so I'll just play other games.
it might affect blizzard. it wont affect china. dont be dense. you wanna free those people? go to DC tell trump to invade china anything else is just theatre
I haven't played video games in ages but if I ever come back I'm sure as hell not playing anything blizzard lol
I was gonna get back on the blizzard wagon with Overwatch coming to Switch. They saved me $80 Canadian.
"Affected" is a broad word. If I lose a breakfast I am affected, but it's fine if I have breakfast every other day of the year.

I'm not saying effort is pointless, but the reality is, videogames as an industry is bigger than the HK cause. 

Yes, posts getting 30k upvotes on Reddit is impressive (for Reddit) but there arw roughly 164 million gamers in America alone. Even if every upvoter, without downvote balancing, had cancelled their suscription, it is still a drop in the bucket.

Are they affected? Yes. Is their bottom line affected? No, not really.
How has Blizzard been affected by this exactly?
100%  All Blizzard software has been removed from console, phone, and PC.  I got my account delete confirmation email last week.  SW:TOR is getting my sub cash now and the are out a constant xpac buyer and multi platform purchaser.
I did as well. This is also the first year since they started offering it that I haven't purchased a virtual ticket for Blizzcon.
I canceled.
Not really. Their stock has been steadily climbing despite these people quitting. Why? Because most people aren‚Äôt quitting and those that say they are, aren‚Äôt. 

Unfortunately consumers dictate success and most consumers have decided that they don‚Äôt mind the Hong Kong story.
Now compare that to losing the entire Chinese market and you understand Blizzard‚Äôs dilemma.
I dropped wow and overwatch and now with the new overwatch and wow coming out I know I won't be going back
What kind of logic is that? Do you have actual numbers of how Bilzzard was affected?

I have 3 friends that canceled and I've read on Reddit that there were more!!!
Same. I spent $500 on overwatch loot boxes then deleted my account to show them what's up. I did that 3 more times with new accounts. I spent 2000 but I'm sure they got the message. #freehongkong
Pisses me off that asmongold gives no fucks. He‚Äôs all about the $$$$.
This controversy has had no effect
Yeah, sorry but no. You can't touch these corporations by "voting with your wallet."

Most people, especially comfortable Americans, don't give a single shit about the lives of people outside of their bubble. See centuries of the US government funding death squads in latin america, having virtually no effect on American politics.
My stock has suffered so much because of you gamurrs pls stop :( /s
Bunch of hypocrites. CoD breaking records.
If Blizz didn't do this I would also definitely have bought a virtual BlizzCon ticket like usual.
Same, dropped hearthstone like a brick after playin since launch.
Boycotting also. Glad I did the new expansion looks lame
Meanwhile Diablo and Overwatch subs are excited about the upcoming games. Guess that's the extent of activism.
Yup same here. I‚Äôm not going to buy any more Blizzard products. But I‚Äôm not going to shit on others that do. I can control myself, not others. Although I hope others will join me.
Do you still use google? Do you still but literally anything? Congrats, you have had way worse impact on the lives of Chinese people than Blizzard who only enacted a contract literally every single Esport title company forces onto their players.           
So yeah, excuse me, you brave hero, saviour of Hong Kong if I can't empathize with you, when selfishness and grandstanding are the only logical explanation for your behaviour. Because I HIGHLY doubt that you seriously believe, deep down, that you are helping anything or anybody.
>  I know a number of people who dropped wowclassic and canceled their subs. Myself included.

No one cares.
Can you get more people to drop out so I don't have to deal with queues when I try to login?
Which pales in comparison to their Chinese customers
Wow if you really think the few people thah cancel their sub did something ... jesus. Noone cares now everyone has forgotten about it.
Did you post this message from your PC or Smartphone of which 0 of the parts or components were made in Chinese sweatshops?
OH no, how will a company ever survive...  
There are still ques on servers, whether they make 1.3 billion or 1.2 billion yearly it's not gonna bother them is it.
I‚Äôm sure it helped with you not giving them 15 dollars :)
I think most people are just having a hard time distinguishing between China and the Chinese people and the CCP. 

Most people actually hate the CCP. As far as the majority of the world is concerned, however, the CCP effective is China.
Nobody cares, it's trendy to shit on anything Chinese now so...
That's why most people hate the CCP.
Context is real important here. Did she say this literally right after blizzard banned the guy from HK? Or was this a one-off thing that happened another time? Also, source?
Didn't she outright post that she doesn't believe the big atrocities that China has done?

I mean, I guess she has to, to not fall under the bad radar of China. But she still did.
Quick reminder she denied that the uyghurs muslims were being murdered in concentration camps.
Needs Shang Tsung voice.

Also Robin Shou (the guy who played Liu Kang) is from Hong Kong.
In case you didn‚Äôt see, the first announcement was the president of blizzard getting up on stage and addressing the issue. They‚Äôre not hoping people forget, they literally brought it up themselves.
Why did they upvoted this to the top of the front page...
you cant farm karma that easily anymore dude, try 2 weeks ago
Or it‚Äôs a bit farm that keeps boosting these to the front on subs with tiny subs. I mean it was at 14k with about 100 comments from a sub with under a few hundred online.
"How does vote fuzzying work and why don't I understand it"
Ditto!
Sounds a lot like people protesting China outside Blizzcon in sunny California... get on the plane and take the trip... to China.
Must have been a wumao
Weird you think China could afford more than one.
That is ... not how reddit works, my dude.
Gamers rising up üëä

All 6 of them
That‚Äôs what I heard from my friend there today. It‚Äôs easy for people to say ‚ÄúI hate Blizzard!‚Äù online. But how many of them would stand outside in the sun rather than go and have fun at the convention...?
Good job
They were at a single entrance, so anyone entering from katella didn't ever even see them.
Probs standing around the westburough Baptist protesters who are there every year.
I don't understand, he said "actions matter more" but what actions are Blizzard taking?
That wasn't an apology for the blitzchung situation, was apology for getting caught. If they really wanted to apologise, they'd reduce blitz's and the casters' ban to zero
It‚Äôs not an apology. It‚Äôs empty rhetoric.
>Actions matter more

>We'll do better **next time**
source?
Think it's pretty clear.

Talk about anything political gets you banned on this non political platform
None of the 30 plus year old kids there were in the bandwagon to begin with. Redditors typically prefer to stay at home and are also alot more minority than they really think.
Thank you. The people that care for Blizzard titles couldn't care less for all of this. Frankly, I'm bored of hearing about it. What do people want Blizzard to do at this stage? The president has now publicly apologised what do the protestors want next? :/
High five fellow deleted
Eh you're not missing much by quitting.
Same here.
damn, you won't get to transfer all your skins for OW 2. Shame
I've been surprisingly productive and happy since I stopped playing.
How do I delete my Overwatch or Blizzard account?
> but they won't get my play hours

They don't make money off of play hours...
That's not an apology and they didn't mention hong kong once, it's a statement made so people like you can hail them as good guys.
And yet they still punished blitzchung
[removed]
D4 wont be out till 2024 at least and OW2 is nothing more than a Patch.
Well no one was censored in America to begin with sooooooo
if you start protesting when you clock in to your job on Monday do you think they are going to ‚Äúcensor‚Äù you?
teccchhnically blizz stocks havnt even recovered from the immortal crash

*but they certainly didnt fall when the blitzchung incident happened*
You support Hong Kong?

- Hong Kongers are being killed by the Chinese government

- The Chinese government ordered Blizzard to punish an American citizen

- Blizzard agrees and apologizes to the Chinese government, thus, Blizzard has chosen to align themselves with said government

- You buy games from Blizzard, and therefore are supporting a company that turns a blind eye to a murderous government

You don't support Hong Kong.
What new game? The sequel to that dogshit D3? The mobile Diablo that went over so well last year?
I hate slactivism as much as the next guy but going out, handing out t-shirts and literally holding up signs for hours is not what I'd call slactivism.
[removed]
[removed]
It's a peaceful protest. What the hell do you want them to do? Burn down the venue?
Let's do that next and address this first. Easy.
Don't hear a peep about Disney and their endless litany of bullshit.
or they just want to have fun and play some video games. That too

edit: also judging by your comment history you are very interested in a diablo t2 remaster lol.
yup- ask someone to grab one, they pay them to ship it to you
There‚Äôs a difference between not caring and not wanting to spend $1500 to fly there and stay in the area
Yep
Awfully excited for a sequel for that pile of trash D3.
Sure but you got to pay for shipping
Looks like someone didnt wait 10 seconds before typing KEKW.
china DOES however care about image. The whole point here is to force not china but BLIZZARD to take a stance, otherwise they're gonna get banned in china over their image being used to protest the chinese government.
*Obviously* this is about putting pressure on Blizzard and other Western companies that kowtow to the CCP. I don't know how you could possibly think people are trying to get Dictator Xi to have a change of heart about freedom and democracy.
Don't project onto those of us who care about this enough to do something about it. I don't think Blizzard will change, they will follow the money, but I still won't buy their games, even if they look great. This is more important than gaming for some of us.
D3 was garbo, why would people buy D4?
Nice try, Blizzard...
Yeah il just pirate all blizzard games from now on
Maybe they'll actually do something to help the situation between now and 2024 when Diablo IV actually comes out. 

In the meantime, nah, I won't buy anything else of theirs.
Speak for yourself.
What's your favorite Blizzard game?
nope, closed my account over a week ago. they're not getting any money from me again.
"We love Chinese money"
Must have been awkward claiming blizzard will kill off mei this blizzcon to not offend China only to see her everywhere
Yeah those are video game subs they care about the new game releases imagine that.
I mean the crazies took over this sub, they can probably do the same to the other subs
Guilty...
Try Yemen, it's closer to home since American bombs are being dropped there.

Yemen what...?
After that pile of trash D3 turned out to be, I question how many people still care about Diablo 4
it's not just Diablo 4 but  also Overwatch 2 and a new Wow expansion.
But Diablo 3 was terrible. Why would Diablo 4 be any better? The talent that made Diablo 2 is long gone. They don't make good games anymore, they make money.
More like redditors usually are the kind that prefers to stay at home
>I'm curious what they think they are going to accomplish here...

They think blizzard is going to tell HK that they get their demands. Because these epic gamers and redditors have confused blizzard with the chinese goverment.
If you check out r/blizzard or the subreddit for many of their games, primarily r/hearthstone, you realize that many players have cancelled their WoW subscription, dropped Hearthstone, etc.
More like 20 tbh
OK, I totally agree. China is horrible and I hope HK residents are successful in their protest.

I refuse to be delusional in thinking that protesting a private American Company that make video games is going to do jack shit for HK residents.
For the ban? It was china pressuring an American company so both. Pretty sad an American company complies with a regime. They released 2 apologies. 1 to western and one to Chinese audiences. The western was just an empty apology when you look at the Chinese letter.
Event is going without a hitch so far!
Why would he theres like 10 people there lmao
Ooooh a sinocel in the wild
Did you forget to change accounts? If not I think your name says it all
You dont get the point. We all agree blizzard action is shitty. If you want to boycott blizzard do it. However what is the point of this protest? what is the end goal? for blizzard to go out and free hong kong?

The whole gamer for freedom is a goddam joke. It one thing to boycott blizzard and it another thing to claim you and hong kong protest are the same and act like you action will free hong kong. Instead of actually pressure the government to do something about it, you here protesting at blizzard and act like blizzard can do anything.
It doesn't matter if it's one or one thousand. You stand for what you believe in regardless of how "dumb" you may look. Concerns of vanity and looking "dumb" is the real sheep mentality here, its why the world is the way it is in a lot of places.
What did you expect them to do about Mei? Delete her from the game?
Kaplan is just a developer though
Lol people are scum because they want to just enjoy a video game in their few hours of free time while they're not slaving away at work? I would say you're scum for acting like people should all do what you say they should do. I'll be playing Diablo 4 but I still hope Hong Kong works out. Like I hope the even worse protests going on in the middle East where people are being blown up and shot for protesting works out. But I know you don't care about that because all you care about is the Reddit karma from supporting Hong Kong.
yeah, so much for all the talk about blizzard banning mei
It's almost like fully-animated short films (8 minutes-ish for the OW one) take a while to make and can't be drastically altered at the drop of a hat.
It's almost like fully-animated short films (8 minutes-ish for the OW one) take a while to make and can't be drastically altered at the drop of a hat.
You care that much go protest. I‚Äôm sure everything will change
Let's see proof of you doing anything more then to back that attitude?
.... At BlizzCon?
They're...

They're at blizzcon, dude.
Are you gatekeeping protesting?
> In fact, Blizzard's stance is the exact *opposite* of this: they oppose democracy. 

What a load of horseshit and you know it.
Woo you came to that conclusion from a player getting punished for breaking the rules of a tournament. WOOOOO nice imagination. You support democracy so much go to HK and protest
Lilith WOOOOO
Except quite the opposite is happening, right as we speak
You clearly need to go out to the real world that is not comfort of your back yard. China have very tight control of censorship. As long as Blizzard do not make Mei official symbol of Hong Kong, nothing you do matter. China can differentiate between Blizzard action vs the protestor action. All your action will just be consider reactionary and be disregard
?????????

??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

lmao what?

Mei is being used as a symbol because the voice actor is from Taiwan and she's not fat.
That wasn't the point at all. The point was to force a public image of the character into supporting HK. Whether the character, voice actor, original concept artist, or anybody else did or didn't, you push that public image so that way it gets tainted and China bans it, hurting Blizzard's bottom line.
I \***should've**\* expected this kind of stupidity from someone who doesn't know what a contraction is.
Two birds one stone
It's 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
Lol, maybe this means she‚Äôll be out of a job when China bans Mei. Then we‚Äôll see if she supports their authoritarian bs.
They totally made that game in four months just for "damage control".
It's going to be an interesting weekend
Basically anyone can hire those kinds of things. They‚Äôre basically just movable video billboards.
"Ominous" as in "people are memoryless idiots who don't care about humans rights abuses."
I think in context, ominous was referring to the [appearance of the protest truck.](https://i.imgur.com/GlrR9Tl.png)
Same as the "Jesus saves" protestors, then.
The convention center is owned by the City of Anaheim, there really isn't anything Blizzard can do about it.  Since it's government property, people are allowed their first amendment rights.
Oh, in that case blizzard should hire a bunch of people wearing that free Hong Kong shirt and start trouble. Learn some west Taiwans tactics
but you have to have a  permit from the private building else you get fine.
We are all ok with it if nobody is violent =)
What? I‚Äôve gone to countless conventions and never seen anything political??? I have seen people preaching to me about God, but never anything like this. What conventions have you been to where this occurred?
And it looks like just a dozen protesters or so promoting memes.
Lol what?
what did they expect to happen? 

OH RIGHT, they expected like 95% of the people at the convention to all get up and walk out during the talks, or shout and scream so much that *no one in the venue will be able to hear anything*

ahahahah
Or, hear me out, we could *not* give money to the people we‚Äôre boycotting
Just don't disrupt people there who just want to enjoy blizzcon. 

No issues with the protest outside.

Cheers =)
you mean you can't take it when the article says it?
we can all say things that aren't true by saying I guess, it's amazing
They use Gilden shirts that are made in the USA.
Yes, those are printed by me! I personally print the shirts at home in Canada. Any proceeds will go towards charities in Hong Kong :)
It would be hilarious to me if a factory in China was printing Hong Kong protest shirts.
What did you do to spread awareness today?
It brings awareness to the situation in Hong Kong, and that companies can choose who they wanna do businesses with - Just like is consumers can choose who to do businesses with.

Many of us aren‚Äôt interested in supporting a company who sells out western values for China.

Same here. Sorry overwatch, see you later!
Yeah me too. I'm also still boycotting ea for the most part, even though relatively they're not as bad.
Worst part is D4 actually looks promising, though GGG will surely crush it with the next PoE announcement.
[deleted]
Ya i made my parents buy Cod instead of me
it is gonna take a D2 caliber of game to get me back. and they don't have that in them anymore. I am perfectly happy not supporting them.
Yeah me too. I'm also still boycotting ea for the most part, even though relatively they're not as bad.
You obviously are behind in the news
You know Blitzchung has signed a deal to play HS professionally for a team right? like, he knew he would get in trouble for protesting, but he's clearly not as against Blizzard as a lot of other people.
Just out of curiosity, if you were truly 100% boycotting Blizzard, why are you in a sub that celebrates everything Blizzard?
"propping up totalitarian bullshit". How so? 

Maybe you don't agree with Brack on how he handled it, or their reasons for the suspension (which were in place before the protests), but it's a little bizarre to think that it's some totalitarian conspiracy.

I think we made our voices loud and clear, and they actually listened to us, so I think many of you are placing your energy unwisely against a company that does more good than bad in the world.
I think they handled it very poorly, but I wont stop giving them money because I dont let politics affect my enjoyment of video games.

I do have my own political stances and I support Hong Kong from the comfort of my home. But these games that people have poured their entire lives and careers into are not politically aligned. Projecting hatred for a country's government onto anything even remotely neutrally or positively aligned with that entity just feels...wrong. It's a reaction lacking empathy. 

You are holding accountable an entire company for the actions of a very small group of management. It doesnt seem to me to be much more different than generalizing and negatively impacting entire races or religions over the actions of a few. The severity and penalties are different.(edit: but the reaction seems to be the same) 

You absolutely have the right to protest and boycott them. But some of the blanket vitriol in this thread is alarming.
Sure, it‚Äôll start small but over time, it‚Äôll grow.

Years ago, a small group of people stopped buying cow‚Äôs milk and started buying plant-based milk. They had limited options and everyone kept buying their regular milk. Now, years later, there‚Äôs almost equal space given to plant-based milk as cow‚Äôs milk in the store and many people are now buying both cow‚Äôs and plant-based milk. And the dairy industry is losing tons of revenue.

Regardless of your view on that, it‚Äôs a great example of how a small group of people letting their beliefs dictate their purchasing, over time, led to change.
Even if they lost the entirety of the west, the sales in China alone can keep Blizzard chugging along just fine.
Boycotting Blizzard is easy. I needed to stop playing wow anyway lol, and I hate most of their other games except SC. But I'll definitely be buying Diablo 4 if it's as good as it looks.
We have to do these things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
To be fair they have already profited from you, so what do they care if you throw everything away?
I salute you for standing up for what‚Äôs right.
What an epic gamer moment
Ah yes, trashing the stuff that I bought, that will show them and it isn't wasteful at all!
Yet you seem to still enjoy the NBA, lol.
Blizzard is an American company. America is in several wars and have practically turned the Middle East into a Muslim graveyard. 
Lately the US have had the record of killing innocent  civilians in Afghanistan including a recent human rights watch report of CIA trained death squads taking the place of American led death squads in Afghanistan. 

I wonder why you are so quiet when all these human rights abuses have been going on for almost 20 years now? Is it because you‚Äôve all been desensitized or just have some weird moral selectivity that magnifies the wrongs of other countries while minimizing the wrongs of your country?
Nice way to show you're anti-environmental.
When did they ever stand against human rights? When you argue from a place of fantasy you don‚Äôt have much of an argument. That‚Äôs why a whole of ten people showed up to protest, they were the only ones who really bought that crap.
still waiting for that difference to materialize itself
Same, I knew gamers would cave, but this time at least some of us will say that this is too far and draw the line in the sand.
Lots more in life than time consuming non-fulfilling Blizzard video games.
So edgy
As someone who had to give up an old friend after talking to him for a few days regarding his subscription to WoW classic, I just want to say thank you.

Too many people are too scared to live by their own morals and it's disgusting.
Nah I dont buy chinese crap off Amazon or anything like that. It's a process and of course some things cant be avoided. Never said I'm a savior of anything. I dont expect people to stop playing, I'm not stupid.. unlike your overly aggressive comment. I never even said a damn thing about helping people. Your whole comment is literally just assumptions from nothing lol fuckin weirdo.
That‚Äôs a great argument. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre not doing everything, you‚Äôre doing nothing.‚Äù Whatever helps you sleep better at night.
> Do you still use google?

Google was kicked out of China for refusing to comply with their censorship requirements. You've actually provided a perfect example how it's possible for a company to act ethically in the face of economic incentives to do otherwise.
Blizzards stock has been going up the entire month. Reddits boycott a great success yet again.
Well, the Chinese  are groomed so that when someone said they hate CCP, they meant all of China. Including the people. And I guess that's what happen to most of us too?
Like niv said, many Chinese are indoctrinated to believe that their government is an inherent part of their identity, so when you say ‚ÄúChinese ‚Äòcommunism‚Äô killed a lot of people‚Äù they say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt insult my country‚Äù.
Pretty much, they are treating the HK/China situation as completely black and white. When nice people in HK are scared to go outside because of rioters destroying things and harassing people who don't support them... Also remember when LeBron James made a neutral comment and then a bunch of HK rioters started being extremely racist towards him... But China bad HK good I guess.
Virtue signalers out in full force!
I have no I'll will to the commoners of China, but their government deserves to be hated for their concentration camps.
Do I get free Karma if I hate China? I am thinking making some YouTube videos about HK I hope you guys give me  lot of clicks. I hope you guys don't mind if I put some commercials in the video clips. I hope I get million views. YouTube clips gonna be uploaded soon I count on you guys to click it. I hope this post get gold. Please HK actevist give this post Gold, give me some karma I will write some bad sentence against China.
This was October 1st, before the blizzard drama, to celebrate 70th Chinese national day. The moment the Blizzard thing happend people started harassing her, Blizzard fans are insane never forget people sent death threats to Brigitte's voice actor because Brigitte was OP at the time.

Sorry I'm having a hard time trying to get what you're saying.

They're protesting Blizzcon at Blizzcon, not China at Blizzcon...
My comment goes back from when OP first posted this and there were only a few replies. The comments that were for the protesters had 0 karma and against them had +2 karma. Seemed like it was just one very disgruntled person to me.
about 12
none, was a non-apology, didn't mention the events, didn't acknowledged what they did wrong, just said a bunch of buzzword hoping the crowd would clap.
Uh...what action would you like them to take? Pretty positive (and thankful) that game publishers don't hold much sway in international politics.
Ahh, the Hulk Hogan apology.
I don't think the "they're just sorry they got caught" turnaround works here. They didn't do anything secretly lol.
They literally did do that though. No one cares about Blitzchung‚Äôs punishment anymore, not even Blitzchung. The issue is their quick response to China about upholding Chinese values, which is rather messed up.
I never even said it was a good apology. Calm your ass.
I mean, they did violate the ToS, and blizz did already reduce the punishment. I'm pretty sure they gave back the winnings, and I'm sure they reduced the ban to 6 months for the player and the casters, so they did step back, but they also don't want everyone to be giving political speeches when they win, so they aren't undoing the punishment entirely.
Are you sure? To me not even that was clear, he literally said nothing about it.
It's proper dilemma.

Bend the knee = more money, more room for growth, jobs and games.

Don't bend the knee = they only get our money. And a small group of western people will be "proud" of blizzard.
Because it was never about HK to Blizz, it was about HK to Reddit.
Lmao you people are like little children. BLIZZ SAY SORRY!!! Ok sorry. NO THATS NOT GOOD ENOUGH WE WANT YOU TO FULLY FUND AN ARMED UPRISING FOR THE PEOPLE OF HONG KONG!!!!
Why would they?
Yeah, no. You can stop trolling people now.
I'm still hyped
dont bring logic into this
> supporting a company that turns a blind eye to a murderous government

can you provide a list of large companies that don't?
Your version of supporting HK is the same as Facebook prayers and wishes. Your doing nothing except harping on people who want to play some games.
Haha if you think that black and white then there‚Äôs no point in talking to you. Tell me all the products you use in a daily basis and if you dig enough you‚Äôll realize so many of the things that you enjoy are a byproduct of Chinese influence. Any movie you watch from Hollywood. Any large tech company ( because you‚Äôd be an idiot to ignore China in the tech industry).  And most video games. Show me how sinless you are and how perfect you are before you judge anyone‚Äôs allegiance lmao.

My morals and ethics aren‚Äôt represented and dictated via a brand or company. 

You probably didn‚Äôt do anything about HK until a video game got involved lmao arm chair warrior / slacktivist. Why are you even following the Blizzard subreddit ? To just hate on your computer? Go wash your neck beard, fam.
Blizzard enforced a rule. If a dude went up and said Vote Trump 2020 you'd likely be red faced and angry.
Lmao yes diablo mobile or whatever was poop but yes myself and many others are hyped to play Diablo IV LOL keep up that no fun allowed energy and staying upset. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Do we know where the funding for the shirts comes from?
>We might not like what this guy says, but is he wrong?

About the amount of people? Maybe not. Calling it "slactivisim"?  Yes. They took action. It would be "slactivisim" if they just posted bullshit on their Twitter feed.
You say that as if there isn't literal photographic evidence of exactly what this guy just described, lol
Hows life being an armchair protestor 5000miles away buddy
Its like 3 people bro. Kinda pathetic showing.
Ah, the old "whataboutism" defense.
Oh, I never claimed I cared about the controversy, I am just saying if you paid for a ticket to Blizzcon, your probably not going because of the China Drama.
I will pay if you can send me one! (Bay Area CA)
It is funny that people think branding some Blizzard's products with the word "Free Hong Kong" will make China immediately ban Blizzard.

If I take a picture of a can of Coca-Cola labelled with sticker of "Free Hong Kong", will China also ban Coca Cola? Same with any product you can think of.

Also, why do China want to ban Blizzard when the latter is desperately licking its feet, just because some pro-Hong Kong wants so? China is not that dumb, or it would not become the second-largest economy in the world.

So unless it is Blizzard who official declares that they are pro-Hong Kong and accepts to lose their market in China, the government over there won't do a thing.
You are very few, a minority, and you probably don't even know why Hong Kong is doing what it is doing.

You'll still probably watch all the videos of how awesome Diablo 4 is.
‚ÄúDo something about it‚Äù?
LMFAO you aren‚Äôt doing anything you dipshit.
I agree. I didn't like D3.

I'm hoping D4 goes back to it's D2 roots.
Oh Zeus, I wish.
Cool.
Maybe, but until then, plenty of people will buy their games.

I know I will.
I do. I will be buying the games.
Probably Diablo 2: LOD, though, Brood War holds a special place in my heart.
Don't worry. Many more will want to rekindle their love for the Diablo universe.

They'll get plenty of my money but you, you boycott Blizzard without actually knowing anything about Hong Kong or China.

Sad.
:'(
D3 is one of the best selling games of all time
At launch, sure. It's a completely different game since Jay Wilson was fired.
you obviously don't play d3. they turned the ship around pretty hard with reaper of souls.
Yep. You're absolutely right. D3 was a flaming piece of dog shit.
Many players or many Redditors?
Never said this was gonna topple the Chinese Communist Party. The point is to not support a company that punishes a protest with crazy restrictions like a one year ban. Even if they cut that in half it was pathetic. If they would've just disqualified Blitzchung for breaking the rules I would've understood, but they clearly wanted to make an example of him. Plus they punished the casters as well.

Not caring about these things is why companies like Apple gave up their iCloud info in China to the CCP. Why in China Apple took out the Taiwan flag. Why an American like Morey had to retract his support of protesters in HK.

I don't want to support it. I think it's immoral, so I choose to boycott them. I'm not expecting to change anything, I just hope it has some effect if we all work together.
Nope. Net Ease handles the Chinese part of Blizzard and they made the calls.
I feel so bad for OVERWATCH and DIABLO. They are getting trashed and that part of the team never determined anything. But I still stand against Blizzard.
> For the ban? It was china pressuring an American company so both. 

Ah, so it wasn't that abusing their platform to send conflicting political messages was explicitly against the rules. Got it. Evil company is being puppeteered by Chinese. That's all there is.
Why would I change accounts? I can be critical against China, nobody says they are perfect, but this is pure propaganda nonsense.
I've already contacted my government about, and IIRC didn't the house or senate pass a bill or something like it in the US?

You're punching air.
>It doesn't matter if it's one or one thousand.

It does matter at least a little bit.
China is known for taking drastic measures from the slightest of criticism. They remove entire shows from their country if it criticized the government. So it's not a completely wild notion
Wait.. so you guys want her banned now??
[deleted]
Neither. Just watching
Idk you seem to be someone who is very against free speech and democracy. Especially since you have deleted various comments this very night when cornered about this exact situation. 

Go ahead, delete my account from Reddit ya power hungry dictator
Imagine thinking China is going to ban Mei. People in china don't see the same internet as you behind the great firewall and even if they did she still be in the US and EU and Asia clients....
Damn looks like she has a job for awhile now.
Anouncing it now is the damage control
If today was anything to go by, no its not.

> "Ominous" as in "people are memoryless idiots who don't care about humans rights abuses."

Wearing a T-shirt to a video game conference doesn't do anything about humans rights abuses.
but only if they affect your video games right?

the human rights abuse that happens in other countries (including your own) doesnt matter, aslong as they keep their mitts off your vidya
To be fair you aren't going to BlizzCon to shout about Hong Kong, you're going to BlizzCon because you've got 3000 hours on reaper and had a wow subscription for a decade. These are their most diehard fans for the most part and those people do not care as much as we the masses do.
> "Ominous" as in "people are memoryless idiots who don't care about humans rights abuses."

It's almost as if they're there for video games and don't want to get involved with 'gamers' who try to thrust politics into everything?
Stop being so hypocritical. Start yourself by stopping to use any product coming from China or being produced in China.
Right! Almost like posting to a social media platform supported by Tencent hahahahahah
Well, we are kind of conditioned this way. Plus we all generally participate in an economy where we own a lot of chinese stuff.
If they did as American voters and tax payers they would have made some dinstinct changes .... But we all know what happens when BLM protests happen and block a road or children are caged .. They will quack and sqwak to feel bit better and most funnily keeps throwing money at Apple, Nike and many other products made at Chinese sweatshops
In fairness not everyone uses Reddit and a vast majority of them probably don‚Äôt even understand what the protest are about.
Jesus Christ why do we need to force everything on everyone? Maybe some familys wanted to go check out the new overwatch and didnt want to have political issues jammed down there throats for a day. Like what do you people expect honestly its okay to escape reailty from time to time that dosent translating into not caring.
People want to live their lives so they're bad people for doing that? Not everyone has a over inflated sense of morality you nostril twirling pig trout
Just going to point out, the player that started all of this has just signed a deal to play Hearthstone professionally for a team. So does that make him a memoryless idiot who doesn't care about human rights abuses?
‚Äúmemoryless‚Äù

If only there was a word for this...
What do you want someone attending a convention in America to do about freedom in hong kong?

Most of these tickets would have been bought months in advance, and they're $200, and for most people it will be the only big event they attend in a year and something they look forwards to all year. You want people to give all of that up because blizzard banned some dude who said free hong kong? Like it's going to make any difference for the people in hong kong?
or they don't think blizzard over enforcing their ToS is a humans rights violation...
I think that the people who paid to be there wanted to go inside and enjoy there advertisements
More like actively hateful.
Or most people just live their lives and realize nothing could be done if they wanted to. I decided that my enjoyment of a game is more important than something I can do literally NOTHING about.
[deleted]
Well if you are going to Blizzcon, you are probably one of Blizzards most die hard / sycophantic followers. 

Or you just don't care about the outside world.

Either way, it shouldn't be a surprise.
> Just more business as usual.

...

> "people are memoryless idiots who don't care about humans rights abuses."

Sadly..... I think you're both right.
yea im sure youve done alot besides comment on social media. keep up the good fight friend
like how your government put children in cages? yep
Let me guess, you do? China has been the poster child for civil rights violations since before either of us were even born, where was your faux outrage before the Blizz controversy?
Hey, unpopular opinion, some of us have jobs that need to get done and just want to get through the day without an incident so we can go home to our families and be thankful.
It is that the games they enjoy from Blizzard are their escape from this kind of shit. People just want their escapism snd this is an attempt to get in the way of that. 

Blizzard didn‚Äôt commit any atrocities against human rights and certainly hasn‚Äôt killed anyone. They banned a few people, temporarily, and took prizes for breaking rules. But the ‚Äúno consequences‚Äù generation didn‚Äôt like that so they are crying about it.
I think you need to put into perspective that Blizzard isn't committing or even supporting human rights abuses. They banned a commentator for making a political comment in order to appease the government of one of their biggest client bases; a government that they would certainly rather not have deal with. And then they negotiated with China to reduce the ban.

Let's calm down.
Or people do care but they prefer to use other avenues of protest because games are just escapism to them.
also others who are extremely selective about what human rights abuses to stand up for
How's the weather up there?
Guys diablo 4 was announced! That more than makes up for it!
Or people who realize protesting blizzard does absolutely nothing to help or hurt anyone.
No, I think most people recognize that protesting Blizzcon does JACKSHIT for everyone in Hong Kong.

People who care actually help Hong Kong residents directly instead of this stupid indirect protest of a private American company.

The American division have already stated they had nothing to do with it. Why are you trying to rip them from their jobs? of creating video games? It's pathetic.

EDIT: 

How many of these protestors actually wrote to their members of Parliament? How many people [sent protective gear to Hong Kong?](https://old.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/ddf659/collecting_protective_gears_to_be_sent_to_hong/)

Nah - instead let's wear some T-shirts and boycott a private company. Such a farce.
Taiwans? This is literally the oldest and one of the most effective tricks in the book.
Police have a tendency to change that.
Blizzcon has a history of protestors. Diablo was very touchy for religious people back in the day.
I have also only ever seen religious people at conventions I have gone to.
>What conventions have you been to where this occurred?

All of them, even the dispursed one too
Are religious protests common outside conventions? I've been to a ton of religious conferences and there are always protestors outside.
maybe he is like an arms dealer or something
Westboro Baptist protest these things all the time.
THE OUTSIDE OF ANY CONVENETION IS POLITICAL SO PEOPLE LEARN TO IGNORE IT NO MATTER WHAT IT IS
We‚Äôre boycotting the protestors?
*how dare you, you should be preparing molotovs with the rest of us!*
Disruption is ***the point*** of protest.

If you aren't disrupting anything, you aren't actually protesting. You are just standing around having a hangout.
Yeah they can protests, as long as they don't actually make a difference though.
[removed]
*Just don‚Äôt disrupt people from supporting a dictatorship*
I agree some people paid alot of money and spent all their vacation time for that trip. I don't malign them at all for enjoying it while they can.
Perfect! Hopefully they aren't shipped to china to get printed on lolol jk. Ty for info. Maybe someone will get one if they can't make it to blizzcon now.
Awesome! Thanks for confirmation. Hope ya got some sales.
Haha I sure hope not. The page said they wanted to get to blizzcon so hopefully it's not that bad. I'm not buying either way.
They haven't spread awareness either
[deleted]
But protesting Blizzard does nothing to help Hong Kong. If anything it's a distraction from the real issue. If you want to help send money or supplies to those that are protesting. Being pissed at Blizzard or posting memes on the internet only makes you feel good.
You can still play ow1 with the new pvp stuff, just dont but microtransactions or the new pve mode.
I can live with what EA‚Äôs doing. There a shitty company making shitty games for money. Nothing new. But Blizzards taking it to a hole new level of shittyness
That‚Äôs really awesome that you‚Äôre willing to sacrifice for your convictions. Too bad there‚Äôs a 1000 morons for every one of you who jump on the band wagon under false pretenses and cheapen the resolve of the movement because they have no character of their own.
Just a bad publisher that forces incomplete games, I always wait a few weeks after release when they're attached
I can live with what EA‚Äôs doing. There a shitty company making shitty games for money. Nothing new. But Blizzards taking it to a hole new level of shittyness
I don't agree with the governments of Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, but I drive a car and use gas, some of which came from those countries. Does that mean I'm not allowed to point out and oppose what those governments do?

Put another way, why do you think a boycott has to be 100% in order to be moral or effective?

Still activision but probably better than playing a ‚Äúblizzard game‚Äù
I‚Äôm not happy about it but I‚Äôm sticking to my guns here. Cyberpunk 2077 can‚Äôt come fast enough.
Diablo 4 looks good imo but not worth it. Let's see if hackers can get that one out for free so I can play it.
Lol, we found the EA bot. Welcome!
Oh, did they decide to support freedom of speech and note their support for Hong Kong? Or are they still censoring the shit out of everything in their games?
What is blizzard doing to help the people of Hong Kong against the fascist mainland regime?
Because I‚Äôm interested in their games - it sucks knowing I won‚Äôt be playing them but I‚Äôm a gamer so the curiosity is there. I especially wanted to check out diablo 4... bummed I‚Äôm not going to play.
So have they denounced that statement made by NetEase using one of the official Blizzard accounts? Because until they do that, they haven't listened at all for all I care. I might be wrong, though. Maybe Blizzard has done more than put out that weak non-apology from Brack.
I think the problem is more that the money being spent is supporting the suppression of HK, someone had compared it to chick-fil-a's anti-LGBTQ in another thread in this post and I think it's fitting; you may not morally support the anti-HK activity, but by spending money and padding blizzards pockets you are financially supporting the anti-HK activity
> You are holding accountable an entire company for the actions of a very small group of management.

You have to, otherwise nothing will change. You have to punish the whole company in order for the decision makers to get the hint.
Exactly.
Not from what I've seen. MarketWatch said activisionblizzard derives 5.2% of it's revenue from mainland China.
> Boycotting Blizzard is easy

-

> But I'll definitely be buying Diablo 4

ü§î
They've already profited, but they've already spent that profit too. People not giving them future money *does* make a difference.
Should have sold the merch if it had any value and donated that money to help the protesters.
Lost future revenue, goodwill, my emotional satisfaction.
Lol you think they can keep running when they‚Äôre customer base turns off the money faucet? I‚Äôm not going to play overwatch 2 and I spent a shit load on the first. They can try and make it happen without my money. Best of luck you bootlicking fucks.
Monthly Active Users is a metric tracke, and reported during earnings, by most of these tach/software companies.

What is a process? Also, THESE are the people that you try to support https://twitter.com/CarlZha/status/1183631556662849536          
Congrats on that, I'm sure they appreciate you cancelling your sub while they actively assault people for being Chinese.
Some people feel superior when they bring others down for doing the right thing when it doesn't immediately change the world. People like that are the type that think nothing is ever gonna change so they might as well do shit and just look down on everyone for trying, it's pathetic.
How much impact did that ethical behaviour have? Or are you suggesting that ALL companies should separate from China? Because if you think this is going to improve the situation you're as wrong as it gets.
Lmao, chinese police literally paid people to stage fake riots in order to muddy the water and delegitimize the protestors.

Congrats, you've bought into literal chinese propaganda.
What proof of rioters? What racist comments? All I've seen is police brutality and propaganda to deny it. HK isn't afraid of rioters. They're afraid of getting tear gased and murdered by the police. For fucks sake.....
I've never seen any rioters in HK PERIOD. Why wouldn't I see the most glaring evidence to paint protesters in a bad light anywhere? I'd imagine that shit would spread like wildfire if it was true.
From a human rights perspective, we can establish China (The CCP) is bad simply by looking at their re-education camps... But there's so much more to unravel. I'm disturbed by everyone who just says "haha china bad right??". Yes, the CCP IS bad. There shouldn't need to be a discussion anymore. If you are their model citizen, you'll be fine, but if you're not.... You're in serious trouble.

So HK is completely warranted in wanting to reduce China's grasp on them. They want to, ya know, not get kidnapped and re-educated and then gang raped by officers and/or become specimens for medical experiments and organ harvesting.

But yes, racism is wrong, but no, his comment wasn't neutral. He said that guy was uneducated on the situation, and looking at what I said above, that sounds like what someone who wants to keep making money off China would say, since if he was educated, he should be anti-china.

Edit; and just to completely clarify, yes, it was wrong of them to be racist. I'm not excusing it, because it's inexcusable. They can be angry at him, but why bring race into it, that's just wrong.
Just don't forget to post it on Reddit and it will go front page + viral in no time.
Damn. There's nothing I can say about that. I don't support China but I feel bad for both voice actors you mentioned. Especially since for the reasons they happened. Thanks for the info.
I‚Äôm not saying this makes it okay. I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre not avoiding the issue.
Happens on many local subs. The 'alt-right invasion' post on r/Melbourne had a few comments that were immediately downvoted quite a bit, as well as anything in support of the IMARC Blockade protesters.
Wut?
Not the action, the reason. Please learn to look at a situation beyond the surface level
They didn‚Äôt overturn his punishment, he couldn‚Äôt even say ‚ÄòWe want to apologize to Blitzchung‚Äô

Just.. nothing? It was basically a ‚Äòhehe we messed up sorry won‚Äôt do it again ANYWAYS WE GOT 59 COUNTRIES PRESENT AT BLIZZCON!‚Äô
Blitzchung getting punished was never the issue. The fact that the severity of the punishment was dictated by china to begin with is the issue.
Human rights isn't politics
just a guess, the release date should be in 2021, and a release date announced in 2020
Or you know, they could simply be honest instead of saying empty words. Instead of trying to look better they could simply try to be better.

By the way, a good fan knows how to see the good and the bad in what they like. You aren't it.
They've been moving the goalpost since this whole shitshow started. 

From overreacting to supporting China to attacking human rights.
You're absolutely right. Many products in America come from countries that employ slave labor, and it's sickening. Chinese influence is everywhere.

I'm proposing to boycott a company that specializes in recreation. If you're unwilling to take even this one small step toward fixing the situation, then you've chosen to ignore the source of your enjoyment and you've become part of the problem.

I don't have all the answers, but I know that we have to start getting out of this arrangement *somewhere*.
Then don't say you support Hong Kong if you support a company like Blizzard. You're a goldfish.

We all enjoy fun but money talks, so we want Blizzard to see the reproduction to their actions, but people like you make that hopeless because all you care about is gaming. On top of that you make this seem like a joke. It's pretty sad how immature you are.
*Made in China*
which most of reddit did.
actually going out and protesting is literally the opposite of slactivism so no this guy is exactly wrong in every conceivable form
And yet here you are...
Ah, the old "whataboutism defense" defense.  I have no problem with Blizzard.  I'm not going to bother defending them again for no reason.

I have plenty of problems with Disney, but I don't expect reddit to give up their precious Marvel or Star Wars movies.
Are you familiar with the Christopher Robin film?
I watched the video on D4, it looks pretty good, sad I won't be able to play it. I do know why Hong Kong is fighting against the extradition bill and are taking to the streets, I do know the history of the city and the claims mainland China has had on the territory since British withdrawl, I do know the 5 demands that protesters have made to their Chinese sponsored leader, and I do know you are an arrogant shithead who I don't have to prove anything to. please slither back down whatever hole you crawled out of.
I'd probably place more of a bet on the other studios working in that genre than blizzard itself at this point. D3 at it's inception was a bit of a dirty cash grab. Although I hear they redeemed it somewhat with the expansions. Dunno guess we'll see.
another fool making baseless assumptions about someone they don't know on the internet.

i at least *try* to be more intelligent than that. yet people like prefer to show the world how stupid and ignorant you are.
Yet no one is playing it nowadays, and it got pretty much destroyed by PoE content wise.
It sold so many copies because people loved Diablo 2, so they were excited to see the sequel. The story in 3 was bland, the skill system was pretty weak and unbalanced, and don't even get me started on the auction house dumpster fire.

The sales figures also come from the sales of the original plus the expansion, which is a bit misleading.

All in all, I am very confident in what I said. The player count was eviscerated after launch. Reaper helped, but it never reached anywhere near what people were expecting. If they move 4 back towards 2 I would line up to play it. But they don't have that talent anymore. Those people left long ago
If the game was garbage when it came out, which it was, it's garbage in my mind. Idgaf if reaper redeemed it. Don't release a half ass game then fix it later. Postpone it if you must.

And this is coming from someone who has undoubtedly spent more time playing diablo 2 than any other game in my life.
Honestly it wasn't bad at all when it came out, just certain parts of it screwed with how **RE**playable it was. I don't know any Diablo players that quit before hitting the level cap or completing the story.
Ross didn't redeem that dumpster fire, it just doused a bit of the flame and threw air freshener to full the smell.



Is the story still shit? Yes. Did they do anything about character permanence? No. Does aesthetics still fit WoW better than Diabol? Yes. Is it still pathetically easy compared to prior games? Yes.
Not at all, was still trash. PoE was and still is MILES better.
It already did... they clawed back on their decision. So why are we protesting today?
True but they still haven't distanced themselves from said statement.
I feel bad for the employees. They seem to stand w America but the company doesnt. Cant imagine the stress they must mentally be going through.
Basically.
What bill did they pass? last years both parties unanimously vote to sanction russia for election interference. Where is the same thing for China? oh nothing.

You are the one who punch air my friend. Because at the end of the day Blizzard can't free hong kong. Either boycott their game and move on to bigger stuff.
Blizzard isn't China. As much as Reddit likes to believe.
Itd be pretty funny if they just made a "bug" where she was unselectable.
It's absolutely hilarious that people thought the whole Mei thing would gain traction, let alone that Blizz would give a shit.
I wanted her bammed because sometimes she is hard to counter in OW.
Wow I've never seen a sadder and more pathetic comment on reddit.

You do absolutely nothing and complain about protesters. Good job.
So only an annoyance who feels the need to share their opinion on things that don't concern them, then. Sounds a lot like how you'd probably describe the same people you're criticizing. 

If you can't think of any better argument than "just because you're not in the thick of it, your voice doesn't matter", then just keep scrolling and let those who believe in something do what they can to stand up for it, while you sit at that keyboard behind the safety of anonymity.
They're physically on site protesting, that is completely the opposite of internet slacktivism.
>Especially since you have deleted various comments this very night when cornered about this exact situation.

lol, I have done no such thing. And I wouldn't, because there's nothing to be "cornered" about. Blizzard did what any company or organization would do.
It's Blizzcon, it's kinda the type of thing they announce at THEIR OWN CONFERENCE
They announced it during BLIZZCON. A convention where they annouced their game. This is like asking why EA announced their game at E3.
i agree that part of it is this, but also another angle is the information exhaustion that our society experiences. 
This is an interesting perspective on the topic if you're interested further and it starts to apply about 1:30 in.

An animal has an evolved self when they recognize themselves in a mirror, knowledge of the self. Even more so when they recognize themselves in another. 

Like some sort of entanglement really.
Or until it affects them financially.
Most people go about their lives with the mentality " I want to do this today, I need to do this today". And will do so over the course of the day. In the process of doing that people tend to cover their ears and shield their eyes to every thing around them.

The suffering of others, is remarkably easy to ignore. Why care for someone's pain when you don't know them? Why care when you don't feel their pain? Why care when you can't see them? Why care when it doesn't involve you?

However, that only really works if the said problem is something they could not directly confront. If anyone went to a place where people suffer, see the event unfold and see the suffering of others. It becomes difficult to ignore, maybe even impossible, even when you take them out of that location. It is because they now have a memory, a very real one that will always strike at one's conscious.

I feel though, this is the biggest hypocrisy of humanity. We preach for freedom, justice and equality. We preach for humanity's greatest heroes. We preach for humanity's fictional heroes. We preach for heroes who stand by their fellow man, and always tell our selves to live like them, to change the world like them. To be better. Yet many could not even bear to lift a finger to live up to those ideals or even help others who lacks those ideals. Only when immediately faced with the exact opposite of what we preach do people even care. But by that point, what does it even mean to be human anymore if all we do is live in a lie that we ourselves constructed, forever unable to actually live to the standards of being human?
Im glad I‚Äôm not one of those people.
Today you, tomorrow me. 
Today them, tomorrow us.
People put things in order of importance. Facts are, people protesting in a country halfway around the world have zero impact on our lives. People waving signs and trying to disrupt your walk to get into the building so you dont have to stand in line as long DOES have an immediate impact on your life. If you are able to prioritize what is right rather than what affects you more then that makes you a better person.
Humans aren't supposed to care about people they don't know. I don't know why any of you would give a shit. I doubt you actually do.

The only thing that makes Hong Kong matter is the effect it has on global power dynamics and how that affects us.
we ignore the suffering of the other animals...
Where is your outrage for Yemen?  Where is your outrage for Chile?  For Venezuela?  Hong Kong is trendy, I get it, but if you actually want to cast wide swaths of accusations at people, accept this much: if you live your life taking pride in being sensitive and exposed to all such issues, you will inevitably be the hypocrite in that equation.

Maybe just worry about what you're doing about it and stop expecting shit from other people, unless you want someone rooting around in how much 'activism' you participate in when it comes to non-trendy issues.
Or they came to Blizzcon to get to the con and see all of the events and such, not give special attention to people handing out non-related propaganda.
It does do something. Maybe not enough. Maybe not much. But something.
I hate this thinking. Raising awareness of the issue helps. Sharing pictures, memes, news articles about what‚Äôs currently happening in HK makes sure it doesn‚Äôt disappear off the news, and spreads the news to people who haven‚Äôt been exposed to it yet. It definitely helps.
It raises awareness of it, that's something. And something is more than doing nothing but criticize their participation.
And pointing this out doesn't do anything for... whatever it is you care about. Yet, you're still here.

So, you're wrong, obviously. It makes people talk. About human rights.
3000? Casual af.

My main on WoW is coming up on 20k, and I know people with way more.
Imagine putting the peripherals down and thinking about the world and your place in it, the effect your existence and behaviour has on outside forces and their effects on you, the ethical structure you adhere to and if therein lies a duty to others as fellow beings, whether because of their humanity or because of yours. Ew. Political.
Everything is inherently political.
No it's about not supporting a billion-dollar company that supports a repressive horrific  regime.
Almost like they're there for video games, but the developer is their for money and in the middle of those 2 things recently human rights entered the crossfire. Imagine that!
to be fair blizzard did this to themselves.  expecting backlash to die down because you're mad at politics is silly
Politics thrusts itself into everything. That is the nature of life.
The impossibility of perfection shouldn't stop someone from trying to be better.
Oh cute, the Nirvana Fallacy
It's not the rights Blizzard abused, it's the rights Blizzard is supporting the abuse of.
Well they pulled a prize pool from a guy for supporting Hong Kong, so freedom of speech.
I care, but I didn't grab a t-shirt because it was crowded.

Perhaps most people just want to go attend the event. Again, just because a couple people made the quick and mindless decision to ban a player on the spot doesn't mean the whole entire company and fan base are mindless idiots or don't care.

The president acknowledged it and apologized. At least that's something.

We all want to support Hong Kong, but what can we really do besides agree with the message? Is anyone going out of their way to setup fundraisers or talk to politicians to get involved in HK? Besides the fact that most of our import are Chinese, what good would effectively declaring war on China do?
Thank you for noticing. I've been on ballots myself. I've canvased. I've led talks.
What's with people and this concept that caring about one thing is exclusive to caring about any other thing.
Exactly. Bettering the world is not a zero-sum game. That's also something that's awful and many of us do what we can to end it.
People can care about more than one thing.  Also that doesn‚Äôt happen.  Completely ignorant you should delete.
You donate to food banks? You donate to homeless  shelters? You adopt animals from the humane society or even just the pound? You do anything to fix someone's life who needs just as much help as immigrants?
Present. One of my strongest memories is watching the Hong Kong Handover (live, as it happened) in 1997 and realizing how much of a catastrophe it was going to be for those who lived there.
He means West Taiwan, as in China.
Weren't those paid protesters to increase interest/media attention?

Or did it like start with that but then the wackos actually picked it up
They‚Äôre not really protests, it‚Äôs just a group of people shaming others for enjoying things. They typically shout, ‚ÄúSave yourself from hell!!!‚Äù They also recite things from the Bible.
Lol, do you seriously think all protestors in Hong Kong throw molotovs? Can you not tell the difference between protest and riot?
Some of the people who are protesting online seem to get angry when you don't agree with their narrative. It's like we all have different opinions. Strange.
I feel like you can inform/raise awareness without being disruptive.
Blizzcon ticket sales started in May this year. Some people would have started planning to travel to Anaheim months before the Blitzchung incident and invested large amounts of money in unrefundable bookings. They don‚Äôt deserve to have a shitty weekend just so a relatively small group of people can feel like they‚Äôre ‚Äústicking it‚Äù to Blizzard.
Sure. How do you think they should disrupt the event? Force their way in?
Disrupting **the individuals responsible for whatever you're protesting against** is the point of protest. If you're standing in the middle of a street or a convention and annoying random people, all you're doing is pushing people away from your cause. Go stand in front of J. Allen Brack's or Bobby Kotick's driveway if you want to protest against Blizzard's statements.
Yep. Protests are generally allowed, until they start to make a difference, and then *bam* the state outlaws them. Look at poor Hong Kong and the oppression the Beijing puppets, the HK police, are throwing at them.
I mean, you can invite them to your place, others can too.

What are you suggesting those protesters do by the way?

Just curious
I think it‚Äôs slightly disingenuous to say that the people who are going to blizzcon just to enjoy it are supporting dictatorships but okay?
You‚Äôre calling Blizzard a dictatorship?  Or are you saying that not protesting/boycotting a company that doesn‚Äôt go against a dictatorship is supporting the dictatorship?  If it‚Äôs the latter, that‚Äôs a very slippery slope, and by the same logic you are undoubtedly supporting many things you don‚Äôt approve of with the countless products you use.
Did you type that from you made in China iPhone or Android phone

Seeing as how there are numerous articles on the topic now from relatively large news sites, I‚Äôd say they did their fair share at doing something they believe in.
Every group always has:

Opposition: those who think it‚Äôs stupid and is against it

Neutrals: not for/against, aka you do you

Interested: They listen, join whatever group it is - But eventually will lose interest, and move into something new

Followers: They support the movement as a whole, and aren‚Äôt afraid of voicing their thoughts - These will most likely also fall off over time

The passionate: often the leaders and die-heads - and depending on circumstances can also be called extremists - They won‚Äôt let anything go, because they‚Äôre emotionally invested in this, and it becomes personal.

It‚Äôs usually 10% Opposition

60% Neutrals

25% Interested/Followers

5% Passionates

Ofcourse it will always vary, but this is roughly how the majority of movements are no matter what it‚Äôs about.
[deleted]
Yeah like a butthole level of shittyness
The movement doesn‚Äôt happen on its own. I have a ton of friends who play everything with me and if 1 or 2 of us don‚Äôt get a game we play something else. I‚Äôll just stick to Apex for now.
Thanks c:
‚Äúeveryone who doesn‚Äôt agree with me in every way is a moron with no character‚Äù
Yeah me too. I have apex a go since it had good behaviour at the start, but gave it up again as it got worse.
[deleted]
I‚Äôm torn thought causw BFV just released pacific
Lmao the irony. Can't support Blizz because morals but then waiting for a CDPR game?
Honestly, crackers would be delivering the superior product, given that it would almost certainly have the always online part stripped out.
its always online

it wont happen
There you go. Stealing something shows your support for HK.
Beep boop ea bad beep boop.
What is valve doing to help the people of Hong Kong against the fascist mainland regime?

What is ea doing to help the people of Hong Kong against the fascist mainland regime?

What is McDonalds doing to help the people of Hong Kong against the fascist mainland regime?

&#x200B;

Maybe, rather than targetting all their effort against a single video game company, people should write to their Members of Government, demand action.You know why America's Trade Tarifs are hurting Chinese and American companies? because America does a ton of trade with China.

Thing is, what do people \*want\* Blizzard to do here?

\- Reverse their penalty? - Blitzchung himself said he knew he was breaking the rules, expected there to be consequences and still a few weeks later signed a deal to be a pro-hearthstone player for a team

\- Do something more? like what? pull all trade out of China? do you think this would harm anyone but Chinese gamers? the normal dudes like you and me who like playing video games?
I do understand that as a moral dilemma. I've seen this discussion in the past with Chick-fil-a, Hobby Lobby and others. What concerns me in this instance is how aggressive and cynical people are being about this. Not just in this thread, but any time this comes up. 

I do understand that it is a loud, passionate minority doing these things. Maybe this is just how the internet is now that activism and outrage culture have blended together. For many, there seems to be no room for reconciliation of what happened. That Blizzard deserves nothing from anybody after this mistake. It's happened little in this thread, but in others people are downright attacking others for supporting the events by simply playing games they enjoy. 

It's not that I disagree with the sentiment. I just don't agree with the extremism. I don't think the management at Blizzard wanted to make a political statement any more than I want people to take my purchase of Overwatch 2 or Diablo 4 to be support of a totalitarian regime. I think the majority of people just want to forget about politics or their existential dread for a while and explode some demons.
You can demand results from those responsible. You can be a shareholder and make noise at shareholder meetings. Be very specific in your complaints and direct them to the people you feel are responsible. It's like using a shotgun blast when a pistol will do. 

However, as I said in another comment, it doesnt seem to matter how Blizzard acts from here on out. The mob mentality seems to be that they are not willing to forgive.  Blizzard will not win those people over. 

If a group of people want to hold an entire company responsible but won't accept multiple apologies and admission of wrong doing from that company, even tentatively, then I don't know what any of us are doing here. There hasn't even been time enough to determine how seriously they are taking this. It's just assumed they are disingenuous. Mistakes shouldn't HAVE to ruin lives and careers in order to be a learning moment. Wanting someone to lose their job or wanting an entire company to be dismantled because you believe that's the only acceptable resolution...that's not something I can get behind.
Sure but I haven't seen this protest advance onto neither the Activision branded titles nor the King branded titles which are typically the ones that would preform better in the west.
> People not giving them future money does make a difference.

I mean yeah but... have you seen OW2?
The money was reinvested and has helped them generate more. It only makes a difference when you convince a majority of their consumers to stop. A few thousand redditors makes no difference.
And the free advertising they'd get from you wearing merch and publicly supporting them. Good on you, don't let people who think like this get in the way of what you believe. Any difference made is still a difference, even if it's minute.
Lmao, get a hold of yourself bud.
their customer base hasnt turned off the money faucet

*you turned yours off*

take a grain of sand from a beach

see the difference? no?
Speak for yourself, finding an alternative game in today's market is pie
Ya it's illogical, but so is throwing out everything you've ever owned from a company you used to love, and then just flick on the TV and watch the NBA with a big grin on your face wearing a Lebron James jersey. I guess that is type of "typical" Redditor as well. Selective outrage.
It's not impossible, you do you. But it's funny that you feel the need to take the time to comment in contrary, so instead of the "hate bandwagon" that you very vocally despise so much, you hopped on the "anti-hate bandwagon bandwagon". Hence the edgy comment, I presume.
That's not the weird part. What's weird is sounding so *proud* of it.
You've now completely changed your argument, but okay.

Many companies today sells products that don't pose an ethical risk. Nike's shoes cannot be used to oppress the people of China or Hong Kong, so it can operate quite freely.

Google couldn't serve censored search results in China without being ethically compromised. Google knew that and so they did the right thing.

Blizzard needs to find an ethical way to make money in China or leave the market like Google. It's that simple really.

This is the problem though, the CCP is bad but the general consensus on reddit and seem's far more racist and hateful towards just China as a whole. I don't like the Saudi Government doesn't mean i hate their citizens, people want to an excuse to hate a company they used to like and it happens that Hong Kong's situation is linked to it.

I ain't no /r/sino poster here where every little thing about China is perfect and every bad thing is Western Propaganda, but this feels so blown out of proportion when Blizzard didn't do anything serious and Blitzchung himself seem's fine with the decision.
‚ÄúRe-education‚Äù camp popped up around 2016.  Prior, there has been several terrorist incidents killing many Chinese citizens in that region.  Camp is likely in response to ongoing terror activity.  Is it right, up to you to decide, but when you fight a totalitarian heck even a republic government, the government will fight back hard.  Just look at gitmo.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_China

This is not agreeing to these concentration camps, however these camps did not just pop out of the blue.  Maybe it was planned maybe it was a reaction.  Either way, Reddit and most media don‚Äôt like to point out the preamble that led to current event.
They didn't even mention his name.   
They did avoid it by simply not shutting up after saying the first two sentences and about how they'll improve in the future and how bla bla bla.    
All they did was acknowledge that they're wet, didn't acknowledge that that's because it's raining and want to change that but haven't even moved under a roof or opened an umbrella
Ditto's description
They're sorry they got caught... enforcing their TOS? Like, that's the literal reason. Which makes them look even less "grr evil", I know...
>Blitzchung getting punished was never the issue.

I was responding to a post calling for removing the punishment entirely, so it seems that is the issue at this point. I agree that the extreme initial punishment was bad, but they did step it back to something much more reasonable. I know that I'm not likely to convince many people here, and everyone is well within their rights to continue boycotting blizzard, but it isn't like they aren't making steps in the right direction here,
How was the punishment dictated by China exactly? The punishment was dictated by Blizzard, not NetEase or China or the CCP.
You don't think this is political for china? You don't think gay marriage was a political topic? You don't think civil rights was a political issue?

Just because it is a good thing and the right thing doesn't make it magically non-political.
They didnt have to apologize in the first place. You people just want to whine and complain and never will accept any apology that blizzard has to offer because that who redditors are.
I love your use of buzz words like ‚Äúempty‚Äù. You literally can‚Äôt even give me an example of something Blizz could say that would satisfy you. You don‚Äôt even know what you want and it‚Äôs hilarious. Your just spouting nonsense online because it what everyone else‚Äôs is doing and you want to fit in and be a part of something lmfao.
youre choosing to boycott the product that is the absolute easiest product to boycott, and you think your one small step makes you better than everyone else. 

it‚Äôs laughable.
So let me get this straight. To understand you and anyone who boycotts blizzard and their games.

You want blizzard to stop supporting their single largest foreign market because of how their government behaves, and your way of doing this is to...


...make their domestic market smaller ?

Well, good luck with that, homie. 

Oh and I have family in Hong Kong. You take my lack of seriousness in the posts directed at slacktivist and arm chair warriors as immature and tbh it‚Äôs simply because I find almost every redditor who e-rages on here a joke. Most of these posters are nothing but ‚Äúthoughts and prayers‚Äù type of people. You‚Äôll unsubscribe from WoW then think you‚Äôre doing your part but didnt do shit lmao but again, a company doesn‚Äôt dictate my morals or ethics. And this situation isn‚Äôt as black and white as you‚Äôre making it out to be. But if you can‚Äôt figure that out then that‚Äôs on you lmao , sheep.
Agreed. But the people here? The people in the image?
What does that have to do with it?
'if people dont protest for everything I care about at once then they aren't doing enough'
Yes, the extradition bill...as in, criminals accused of reeeeeeally bad crimes who escape Mainland China and into Hong Kong. 

Seems fair even though Hong Kong IS China and China could, if it wanted, just waltz in there to get the criminals themselves. Instead, they basically ask permission with a bill that says, "Hey, Hong Kong, if really bad people escape into Hong Kong, will you kick them out please?". 

Also, we're Chinese here...my partner, she was actually born in China and moved her when she was 14. So, yeah: we definitely know more than you do about what's going on.

Yeah, sad you won't be able to play it though! Even though we both know you'll cave and buy it eventually. You'll try to get away with playing a friends version of it, but you'll get it eventually. Even if you don't, there's two over here who will definitely be getting it. 

Oh, and we already pre-ordered Warcraft III Re-forged. Can't wait to play it in a few months.
Sure there are other games, Path Of Exile is definitely my gritty replacement for Diablo II and it's a free game, but it won't really matter since I've been in love with the Diablo Universe since I could read.
Yes. I can tell you're the superior intellect here by how well your sentence is structured.
[Citation Needed]
You‚Äôre confident is pretty misplaced then, 30 millions in sales is not off of good will. 30 million sales is because it is a successful game and was well received.
>if reaper redeemed it.

It didn't.

If you played efficiently it turned into spamming 1 or 2 buttons.

2 AT THE MOST!
you completed the story at around level 30 or so. then you had to replay it over and over again to reach max level.

once you reached max level you found out that legendary drops were rare and there was no guarantee the stats they rolled with was even relevant to your class but don't worry you could just open your wallet instead and buy perfect drops from the auction house.

on top of that hardcore players got assassinated in the blink of an eye by ghosts on certain maps and inferno was totally out of scale when it came to difficulty making it literally unfun to play.

all in all it was a total shit show and with Reaper of Souls they had fixed most of that with torment levels, cube to allow gear flexibility, ancient gear to cater to those that wanted to grind and loot 2.0 that at least guaranteed relevant stats on your drops.
Well they did overrule the punishment by a bit.
Literally the WOW Q&A summed up perfectly. The kid was screaming and interrupting and the guy was like, yea I agree.
I've already boycotted their games, deleted my account and contacted my government.

A great read 451, and a great point as well. Some other stories, and even metal gear 2 have mentioned this. Sense we have such a huge amount of info, how do we vet it, find an issue to fix based on facts, or process all of it. It's a very new issue for humanity, so we or the next generation will have to find a solution somehow. Hopefully an ethical one.
Imagine thinking people only get to stand up for or protest against something if they are totally unimpeachable themselves and have been standing for the issue their entire lives.  The notion that changing events or circumstances might inspire someone to action makes them a hypocrite, the notion that something being raised higher in the public consciousness and so people flock to support it is seen as hopping on the bandwagon.

What's really vile is people who hide behind their keyboards squealing 'no true scotsman' at the people who are actually in the street and actually standing up for what they believe in.
This should be the top comment.  Stranger I wish I could give you some gold for this but I have no moneys instead I'll wish you a good day
You‚Äôre bothered by the fact that people chose their fights? That they don‚Äôt accept your view of the world being black and white? That if they don‚Äôt live out their life in a cave, their actions are hypocritical? That‚Äôs the sentiment of every loser with a keyboard trying to justify their own inability to act.
I do not use Apple products, buy Nikes, watch Disney-produced media, and try to avoid the others when I can. You should look up "Fairphone"; A company tried to make a cellphone where no human suffering was an ingredient, and found it is literally impossible. There are parts that are *only* made in sweatshops that infrastructure to do elsewhere simply doesn't exist for, because it doesn't need to.

The practice is so ingrained into our industry it is literally impossible to completely divorce yourself from while remaining a part of the modern world. Saying that unless someone avoids all of them then they should avoid none of them is unfair at best, and ignorant at worst.
Abolitionists wore clothes that were most likely made by slaves at the time. They realized that slavery was the problem, not the clothing. You don't fight the entire war at once, you fight battles. 

Blizzard is a smaller company than the super corporations that you mentioned. They might actually listen. 

And I mean, come on. Reddit calls out every single one of the corporations you mentioned as well. Nobody is singling out Blizzard.
Not to mention: How many people that are so angry about Hong Kong are in the same group that are angry whenever someone protests police brutality in the US?
I've always hated Apple products, that flame growing starting back in 2005.

I haven't cared for Disney since I was a child. Marvel included.

I've never owned Nike anything.

Saying all this just makes me sound pompous, even if true. People are fickle.
No Apple, no Disney, Nike was on clearance. How am I doing?
Apple? No.  
Disney? No.  
Nike? No.  


About the worst thing I support with my dollars is every now and then I'll buy clothes that aren't ethically sourced because, well the premium for ethical clothing is just way too dammed high and I just outright don't have the money.
The fact that there are more companies doing it doesn't mean we can't call out Blizzard on this. You're not proving anything new.
That's how you start not caring about anything. 

* Why care about China when your electronics made there?

* Why care about BP/Shell environmental disinformation  campaign when you use their gasoline?

* Why care about blood diamond in Africa when you buy one for your engagement?

* Hell, if you are In WW2, why care about Jewish in concentration camp when you use German car and buy their Hugo Boss suit?

The matter of facts is, you NEED to be selective. Find alternative if possible. Apple bending to China? Go with Samsung which use less Chinese materials. BP use misinformation? Switch to electric car if possible or take more public transport. Nestle bent the knee? Use like a cal made product of possible.

That's how you do it, not finding excuse so you feel better about using their products!
youre just gatekeeping activism. its the same with people who get mad when someone tells them about climate change and try to throw it back in peoples faces and say 'well what are you doing? do you drive a car? do you ever buy anything made of plastic? you can't say anything!'  


no, people can speak up even if there are other things going on and even if they themselves aren't perfect
"hUrR DuRr wE LiVe In A sOcIetY hUrR dUrR"

That's how stupid you sound.
You wrote how I feel every day. I wonder this, in an unhealthy manner. I appreciate knowing im.not the only one with stuff like this on my mind. You lifted a huge weight off my shoulders.
That's the point of all of that heroic mythos, people fantasize about what they cannot do themselves.
You do not speak for everyone, and this is happening less and less more then ever now because people are realizing how things are connected.
Just cause your a callous jackass doesn't mean everyone else is.
> I don't know why any of you would give a shit.

Well there you go...
There are groups that protect other animals, plus those that don't consume meat because they don't wish to harm them, but as you say there are those that ignore animals pain too. People are complex that's why asking questions, exploring morality is a good practice.
I wasn't trying to accuse anyone of anything just share some thoughts is all. I didn't wish to offend.
It makes it difficult for them to stream the event in China
It's performative at best, is the point.
Nothing is still nothing. It's like trying to empty out the ocean one glass at a time, it's "technically something" so you can pay yourself on the back.
No. It really dosent. China doesn't care what some guy in america is wearing
tell me what it does exactly? What is this "something" that it will do?
Was it though? Most of the time they were ignored or had a passing comment, they were like any other person. No. One. Cared.
I am a Hong Konger, I think you are helping! Thank you so much!!

Anything that can let the world know about HK is helping!
> I hate this thinking.

So do I, which is why I don't think it makes any sense to shit on people that don't participate in your cause. Go and hand out as many free t-shirts as you want, but don't shit on people that don't want them.

That's not "doing something" that's "feeling superior".
[deleted]
I feel like everyone that is attending blizzcon already is aware of Hong Kong. I went there today and passed by them.

I thought about grabbing a shirt but it was too crowded when I got there this morning. 

I support Hong Kong, but I'm not gonna fight tooth and nail to let everyone know I do. There's not much more that I can do besides upvote reddit posts or take a shirt that I might wear once every few weeks.

The president apologized already, and when you have an image to uphold, you can't unequivocally go out and say things. The people that decided to ban the player probably acted out of fear but they didn't consider the brand image of Blizzard when they did it.
Helps who, exactly? 
The oppressed farmer is suddenly relieved because I laughed about a meme?  
HK is suddenly free because someone shared a picture?  
In the current time and date, awareness is important but usually somewhat "easily" achieved.  
Actions are not and I fail to see any - no one on reddit REALLY bats an eye about things that happen in Africa, China or even in their own land and country.  
America is especially guilty of this - outraged about video games, while someone with a few loose screws almost weekly walks into a school and just shoots people.  
HK is an even worse example - no entity in the worlds sets actions or consequences, hence a video game company get's lynched for not doing so.

You break into a shop. You shit on the floor. The owner comes back and asks you to stop shitting on the floor.

The owner doesn't support the govt. He just doesn't want you to shit on his floor.
Wait, what does Apple have to do with this?
So you refuse to purchase or interact with any company who supports the mistreatment of others? How about all the US companies who have ties to our own government which is responsible for some pretty disgusting things in recent history? Or is it just Blizzard specifically?
it sucks that the people that make the games get paired with the people that don't make the games, but whatareyougonnado. If the names were publicly available it'd be much easier to target them but then you'd cross the borders which you are there to defend
So why aren't people protesting at League of Legends Worlds atm?

America is the regime no?

Are you referencing the insane levels of propaganda gamers consume?
> Almost like they're there for video games, but the developer is their for money and in the middle of those 2 things recently human rights entered the crossfire. Imagine that!

Human rights never entered the crossfire, just politics. And it was foisted there by the same fools doing this.

You KNOW that blizzard is a company. Just like any other company. They have simple, easy to follow rules.

Could you stop trying to shit on the floor for 30 seconds, or is that beyond you?
> to be fair blizzard did this to themselves. expecting backlash to die down because you're mad at politics is silly

Blizzard didn't hoist a man onto the stage and force him to spout political slogans.
> Politics thrusts itself into everything. That is the nature of life.

Are you the kind of nutjob that tries to force their way into an occupied stall pretending that you have a right to do so?
Freedom of speech doesn't protect you from a private company taking away your bounty. A better word is freedom of expression in this case. He's allowed to say it but be prepared for the consequences.
You people literally have no idea what freedom of speech even means. It protects you from the government, not from private establishments which can have their own rules on what speech they allow.

&#x200B;

If they guy was sporting a MAGA hat and directly supported Trump and they did this literally no one would complain.
That guy signed a contract saying that he agreed that his prize money would be reduced to 0dlls by engaging in an act that brings you into public disrepute or offends a portion or group of people. An adult entered into a contract, broke it and got the consequences he agreed to. (even less, cause they reduced the ban and gave him his prize money back) 

 I support Hong Kong, but just like a guy say, going into a tirade about abortion being murder would have no place in a hearthstone tournament, neither does politics, he knew it agreed to it and then did it anyway. That said I'm glad he got his money back.
That's not a freedom of speech issue. Christ. Do they not teach you idiots this in school anymore??
Since when did freedom of speech apply to a private business' own platform?
They pulled the prize pool from a guy because he broke their no politics rule, he broke their contract. Are you people insane? Or do you know understand what freedom of speech is?

Ate the onion
It was a figure of speech, you big-eared elephant.
I mean, there are videos ans news reports of molotovs and IEDs.

But it's true that it's not all protesters or could be agent provocateurs.
You‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôre not in HK where the protestors beat you up if you don‚Äôt agree with them. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre old, or a petite woman, everyone who doesn‚Äôt stand for ‚Äúfreedumb‚Äù is attacked
Yeah! Some of us want to play video games and some of us want to play video games and preserve human rights. How dare they force their disgusting human rights on me!
If all you are doing is 'informing' then you aren't protesting.
You'll never get anything done walking around on eggshells worried that other people might have a bad time.
However they feel like.

I have a problem with this reply in particular. The problem is deeper than "support blizzard = support dictatorship" let's take Chick-fil-A for example. They are known for donating to Christian organizations who support the oppression of gay people. Does eating there mean you support that oppression? Yes and no. It's an ethical question more than anything
"sure, I buy blood diamonds, but that doesn't mean I support ethnic cleansing?"
Blizzard is a company. How could they be a dictatorship? They‚Äôre just a shitty company willing to support the censorship of a brutal totalitarian state to make money. That doesn‚Äôt make them special, but it does make them unworthy of my money or support. I suggest anyone who enjoys their freedom of speech to do the same, otherwise some day you might be banned or silenced yourself.

Try again.
You are very intelligent.
What did they do?
a girl can dream
not giving money to corporations that have shown themselves as anti hk does, don't mean I can't find the game by other means

but if stealing really did help, I would 100% steal
Start by removing pro-Hong Kong censorship on their platforms. 

I can criticize China in McDonalds.

I can criticize China on valve.

I can criticize China on Apex. 

We HAVE a bill to help fight for Hong Kong: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-condemns-houses-passage-of-bill-supporting-hong-kong-democracy/2019/10/16/d513a432-efbf-11e9-bb7e-d2026ee0c199_story.html?outputType=amp

Reversing the penalty would be a good start. 

Reaffirming their ‚Äúlisten to every voice‚Äù policy would be a good follow up.

And as a company that brags about how ‚Äúwoke‚Äù it is, maybe actually make a statement of support for the people of Hong Kong but I get that‚Äôs probably never going to happen. If they could put people before profit this 1 time, it would really make me happy.
> The mob mentality seems to be that they are not willing to forgive.

I disagree. The issue is that, currently, they have not apologized for what they did, only for getting caught doing it. They are giving apologies that are meaningless because they aren't address what they actually did wrong.

> If a group of people want to hold an entire company responsible but won't accept multiple apologies and admission of wrong doing from that company, even tentatively, then I don't know what any of us are doing here.

That's the problem. They HAVEN'T apologized or admitted their wrongdoing. They made up something else, and then apologized for THAT. It's basically PR bullshit 101. Make up something that sounds related, but is not the thing people are actually angry about, and then release a PR speak apology about that, instead of apologizing for what you actually did. Then you'll have a bunch of white knights who haven't paid enough attention to what you actually said (or plain just don't care) come to defend you.
When has a single vote ever mattered? That doesn't mean you shouldn't vote.
The board of directors are judged by the level of growth they manage to achieve. A few percentage points shaved off the overall growth of the company could actually make a big difference to their remuneration and future as members of the board of directors.

You don't need anywhere near a majority to make a difference. You just need to get loud and get active.
Ok Nihilist.
You sound like BioWare dude.
TBH I think playing the games and making them spend money to keep the servers running while not spending money on anything else would be better
Ah, so you are saying we should just.let every comment live in eternal bliss that they are right and everyone thinks the same way they do? The internet is going to be a boring place, soon, if that is the trend.
Playing games I enjoy and supporting their developer? Yeah, you are right. That IS strange.
I was under the impression that google operated in China. But do you think that google is not operating in China for... ethical reasons? You think China offered a billion $ check that Google refused? I think there's another reason for it...           
           
Also, are you saying that Nike's shoes cannot be used to oppress the people but Blizzard's games can?
Regardless, riots against an authoritarian regime are inherently legitimate and justified.
It's more that it screams of 'whataboutism'.  Sure there's going to be some people supporting it that take it too far or target the wrong people or whatever, there's always going to be some in any movement that's more than a handful of people.  But compare those relatively isolated incidents with protestors disappearing, being gang-raped and/or being beaten to a pulp or people trying to organise boycotts against companies that support China compared to china completely cutting off companies that don't crack down on the slightest support of Hong Kong.
They just fell in line with the CCP, just like many other countries and corporations, and it's understandable to not be happy with that. It comes down to the CCP's censorship spreading globally, and getting censored by a foreign power doesn't sit right.

And I hope people aren't actually hating the citizens... It's not like they even know what's really going on, and if they do, I think they've realized how dangerous it would be to talk.
But your original quote was claiming that they were trying to pretend they weren‚Äôt wet
TOS =\= basic sense of morality.
I have a bridge to sell you.

For real though, have you been living under a rock? China has influenced many American companies to take action when they throw a tantrum
LGBT topics are definitely political in some places, which makes it weird that Blizzard so openly takes a stance on it but not on this.
Ah yes, for apologists for criminals against humanity, it is "politics". How about you use that brain of yours though and realise that talking about taking away 1million + people's basic human rights to free speech, and fair trail is a slightly more pressing issue than where you believe something like tax law should be
Blizzard is an American company and human rights shouldn't be a political issue. there shouldn't have been any punishment for what was said.
Torture isn't politics
You could at least pretend to have read the comments chain before jumping into the defense of the multi million dolllar corporation you seem to think can do no wrong, because I already talked about that.
Buzz word? It wasn't a real apology, they don't intend to change anything, it doesn't get much emptier than that.

What could they say? Be frank about the situation, spell out the reasons why they do what they do. I thought it was pretty obvious with what I said on the last post.

By the way, being a blind zealot to blizzard won't a) gain you any favors with them (chances are they will never acknoweldge you exist) b) it won't motivate them to continue supporting the game you like (money is what decides what lives or dies, your non monetary support doesn't really matter to them). You might as well actually speak your mind instead of trying to pretend the problems aren't there, and that anyone who calls out those problems is "X insult".
Even if it seems hopeless I'll avoid buying from them. I don't participate in the boycott because I expect Blizzard to crumble into dust. They did something morally incorrect, and I can't support that. If everyone thought it was pointless obviously nothing would happen because they all give up. You want to call boycotters armchair protesters but what the hell do you expect me, a broke college student, to do other than not give them my money? The hope is that it gets a message across, and I think it has. It wasn't very successful because Blizzard will never admit they care more about shareholders than players. I know this is the case with most game companies but at this point they're even punishing the players. If they had just disqualified Blitzchung for bringing politics into a game I wouldn't have batted an eye, but they literally banned him for a year before bringing it down to 6 months. That's pretty severe for a couple of seconds of protest.

I never even said to pull out of China, but if dealing with China means having to be policed by the CCP then they need foresight. Also, Blizzard was founded in the USA and their headquarters are still in California. Blizzard is an American company afraid to be banned in China, and that fear overpowers Blizzards supposed values. People want to act like China didn't assert their influence when there's hundreds of examples of China controlling American corporations. From banning the Taiwan flag icon on iphones to forcing Morey to retract his statement.
Yes. Exactly. That's what I want Blizzard to do. 

Stop supporting international criminals.
the 13.4k people that did not bother to show up at the protest and let the 50-100 people down that were protesting there. The people that actually protest at blizzard at least did something, even if it was never going to be effective. At least they actually care a bit about HK and not just. I hate blizzard so I meme.
That they actually showed up no matter how few. Meanwhile all the armchair critics in here talking about a pathetic showing.
You're doing nothing.
Sorry what? You think being ethnically Chinese makes you somehow more knowledgeable on the situation than someone else who has clearly done research?

Also, the extradition bill would allow for anyone in HK to be extradited on request of the Chinese Government, and the approval of that request would be totally up to the Chinese elected CE WITHOUT a criminal trial. Not only is that a total abuse of power, but it undermines Hong Kong's independency and could be seen as the first step to a slippery slope of Chinese political intervention in HK. That's why it is being protested.

I don't understand how people like you can try and justify the actions of China's clearly tyrannical government. From the suppression of information, to the 're-education camps', the Chinese government is doing unforgivable things. Is it because of your ethnic link to the country that you feel the need to support them?
You don‚Äôt need that, just play both games and you will notice the difference immediately.
I wouldn't be so confident in a game that got outsold by Wii fit. But honestly the number of copies a game sells doesn't mean it's good. It means its catered to the lowest common denominator. Which is why a game like Wii fit outsells Diablo 3.

Your mindset matches their's though. They make money, not games. If you like that go ham, but it's a cycle that makes objectively worse games.
Lol to be fair that's what diablo 2 was.... Which I loved. However, we do expect some sort of progression as these games continue to release.
Oh I definitely know all that, but people make a big deal and say "This game was crap" when the fact was "This game's ENDGAME was crap" would be far more accurate to say. RoS fixed the endgame loops to be fun and made seasonal stuff that brought people back to the game over and over.

I enjoyed D2 and D3 but D3+RoS actually kept me coming back and playing far more than any previous iteration did.
Without revoking the statement, and stating that the punishment was justified anyway. 

Or, in laymans terms, trying to stem the rage rather than fix the mistake.
Ok good then move on. You already hit Blizzard where they hurt. What is the end game of protesting Blizzard and act like you are hong kong protestors? what is the end goal of all this? to give blizzard more publicity ? or you guys like to waste air?
I have no part in any of this either, so that's water off my back. The difference is that I keep any negative opinions to myself, as I'm not so hypocritical as to call out those who _do_ anything for what they believe in while I'm in my "safe space". On the other hand, you criticizing from behind your keyboard are risking what, exactly? Aside from making yourself look like an idiot, I mean. That ship has sailed, I'm afraid.
Where do you live?
Do you expect Americans to protest *in* China?
I think it starts with getting money out of politics, as potentially tangential as that may seem. It starts the snowball effect which with continued improvements allow us to solve this problem. Without getting money out of politics, all good potential solutions to the problem will have this as a roadblock.
The solution is focus on the problems in front of you and the people around you.  Do what you can to help yourself your neighbors your family and friends....  Im not saying ignore the other side of the world, (because we need to have a global perspective on things since we are all in some way connected) but chances are there's not much you can directly do to help everyone.  
So help and support those around you so they can help and support those around them and so on....
Ripple effect.
Be good to your neighbors people.
If you are going to call people "idiots who don't care about human rights abuses"  for not protesting blizzard. Then yeah you should probably not be doing the same shit just with different companies that are actually worse. If you want to selectively boycott thats cool, but acting high and mighty and putting others down while doing the same shit yourself with a different company is pretty stupid.
Right. That comment made me immediately think of [this](https://i.imgur.com/CDgZs2m_d.jpg)

Edit: full and better version [here. ](https://thenib.com/mister-gotcha)
What beliefs are you standing up for when your protest starts and stops with Blizzard?
> I wish I could give you some gold

A fraction of that money goes directly to China, you know that right?
I am bothered by the people who have chosen this to be their fight and absolutely shit on anyone who have chosen something else. It reminds me of militant vegans that go over the top at people who haven't chosen to give up meat.
.....The whole point is the hypocrisy in calling people 'memoryless idiots who don't care about human rights abuses" for not boycotting blizzard while there are many companies much more direclty involved in human rights abuses that these redditorrs are not boycotting. Yeah you can call out Blizzard selectively that is fne, but your a hypocrit if your going to insult people for supporting a company for one reason and then turn around and support companies that are much worse in that same reason.
I do not speak for everyone. I said "most people". By no account does that mean everyone, nor does that mean that I speak for them.

If you would, could you clarify what is happening less and less?
[deleted]
I'm just saying exactly what caused all those people to ignore the protesters as they passed them.

Do you disagree? Do you not think that was the case? Do you think they actually "cared" when they ignored them?
ok bud lol go stop the insects from eating each other lol
Not sure how considering they are outside and 99.9% of it takes place inside.
So a joke, because performances usually are done for entertainment.
People nowadays especially Americans imho engage in shallow forms of activism often fueled by outrage coming from the MSM which often takes the form of virtue signaling and exhibiting a false sense of moral superiority
Except I‚Äôm not doing that, the guy above me said that handing out shirts is ‚Äúuseless‚Äù, and I was saying that raising awareness / making sure the news isn‚Äôt forgotten IS a good thing to do. Nowhere am I shitting on people that don‚Äôt participate. 

In fact I‚Äôd say the people shitting on the protestors saying ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not making a difference‚Äù, ‚Äúwhy bother‚Äù are the ones that are playing the cynical part to feel superior.
>I don't know anyone

Which is very limited... if even just one person sees the tshirt who was not aware before and is now, it's a win.
I am a student of International Relations. I have had to explain the HK situation FROM SCRATCH to several people in the same programme: People who expressed interest in the topic, and would certainly seek answers... all it took was a real and proper mention for them to ask 'wait what's going on?'.

People need to know. And this is how they get to know.
You'd be surprised how much of the General Audience remain unaware, deliberately or otherwise.

And raising awareness is useful. Otherwise this controversy wouldn't have reached the ear of the US Senate. Don't try to diminish the small acts we do to help the larger picture. Only dictatorial tyrants and their lackeys shout down awareness raising (while on the other hand censoring media - why do that if awareness raising is useless?).
>but I wanna do memes!
I don't know anyone who isn't aware of Coca-Cola, yet those morons keep wasting millions or useless advertisement. You should contact them and tell them that, they might give you some reward!
bitch this isnt the Susan G breast cancer awareness campaign. Most people certainly do not know what is going on in Hong Kong. Yes on reddit it is fairly popular but the average joe is not aware.
yeah but are you AWARE of breast cancer yet?
Cool. Like what?
Yes, tell the person living in Hong Kong what is and isn't helpful to their cause.
Now educate them. All my friends know about the crisis in HK as well, but very few of them actually knew why it happened, how it happened and what's going on, until I told them.
"Raising awareness at this point is useless" - As if upvoting news takes soooo much work from you. 

It's a matter of making sure the issue doesn't get forgotten while HK is still fighting. It's literally the least we can do. "Do something useful"? If you want to do more, feel free to donate against China's shitty regime.
Even if people know, it's to make sure HK isn't forgotten by the media/people. The struggle in HK is still ongoing. 

Nobody's asking you to fight tooth and nail. I literally listed the things that you can do to help as, "sharing pictures, memes, news articles". 

The point is, we want to keep HK in the news long enough that it becomes a bigger point of discussion in America, and puts more pressure on China to give up trying to take over HK. Or at the very least have enough of a spotlight on HK that China can't pull some *extremely* atrocious things to try to take over.
I've been playing for 15 years. It adds up.

It's just a fact of life.

Politics have become so broad and all encompassing that everything you do is now a political statement.

It's stupid but that's how shit works now.

Political views and opinions are basically synonymous. Everyone has them, everyone shows them constantly, and most of them are terrible.
Except blizzard specifically apologized to the Chinese people.
I'm sorry is the lesson here "human rights are poop?"
Weird analogy.

&#x200B;

>You break into a shop.

&#x200B;

Not sure how Blitzchung signing up for the Hearthstone tourney in a totally legit fashion is the same thing as a criminal offense but sure.

&#x200B;

>You shit on the floor.

&#x200B;

Supporting a protest movement = shitting on the floor?

&#x200B;

Remind me to never ask your opinion of MLK.

&#x200B;

>The owner comes back and asks you to stop shitting on the floor.

&#x200B;

Wait I thought the guy broke into the store . . . But the owner is actually there?

&#x200B;

So why did he B&E if the place is open? Like he coulda walked through the front door but just didn't because reasons?

&#x200B;

>The owner doesn't support the govt. He just doesn't want you to shit on his floor.

&#x200B;

Yeah but what if the owner doesn't actually care one way or another if you shit on his floor, but if he supports the government position on floor-shitting he might make some more money from customers who don't like floor shitting, but also might alienate all those customers that do like floor shitting, like me!

&#x200B;

This isn't an analogy anymore, I actually really like floor-shitting.

&#x200B;

It's liberating.
Every bit helps. Every journey starts with a single step.
It's a binary choice; China is actively suppressing the autonomy and freedom of the people of Hong Kong. If you don't side with Hong Kong in this matter, then you are complicit in China's actions.
no, but they put a man who they hoisted on stage on full blast because he did say something political
This is what it sounds like when life hands you everything, to the point you can just sit on your lazy ass doing nothing good for the world and act like it's a virtue to not care.

By taking this lazy ideology, all you're doing is showing support for the status quo, whether you want to or not this is what siding with China, and any authoritarian in power looks like.

So do us a favor and either take some kind of stance on something like an adult, or learn to keep to your trap shut while the grown ups are talking.
That wasn't the point. The point is that all that we do has political connotations, from what we eat, what we wear, what entertainment we consume, etc.
Are you the kind of nutjob who doesn't actually have a point and just says random shit when his obtuseness is called out?
The crux of the matter is that China is able to use it's gigantic market and influence to indirectly stifle opposing voices in other countries. That's definitely a freedom of speech issue. Blizzard isn't the first, but is one of the most visible corporations to kowtow to China to stay on their good side, so it makes sense they are being protested.

Edit: Besides, freedom of speech and freedom of expression the same in almost every aspect. See the Oxford Dictionary definition of freedom of speech: "the right to express any opinions without censorship or restraint."
Yes, the consequences of a company who supports human rights abuses.

Like harvesting organs.
No one is calling for laws to be applied.  They're not trying to take Blizzard to court.

Seems like you're the only one with this misunderstanding about freedom of speech.  

We are all endowed with certain inalienable rights, whether they're listed in the Constitution or not.
Since when did ANY rights apply to a business platform?
They get away with it due to a loophole regarding freedom of expression. [See this episode of "The Patriot Act" with Hasan Minhaj.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQ5-NMzG8s)
So I guess the colonists should have never dumped a private companys tea in the water...

Blizzard pulled the prize money I support of a government that does not allow freedom of speech. It is conpletely fair to say that boycotting blizzard is in support of freedom of speech.
human right num. 19. **Freedom of Expression.** We all have the right to make up our own minds, to think what we like, to say what we think, and to share our ideas with other people.

aaand num 18. **Freedom of Thought.** We all have the right to believe in what we want to believe, to have a religion, or to change it if we want. (for good measure)
Not here to argue about blizzards ethics, but according to the UN, free speech is indeed one of thirty human rights.
Free speech is absolutely a human fundamental right. However it's mostly protected from the government not a private company.
Then what is a human right?? The right to free speech in America is called the first amendment. 

Obviously they're a private company, but then why bother bringing rights up at all?
What? Natural rights are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Liberty is by definition, "the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views". Sounds a lot like freedom of speech is a human right bud.
I just know you hide behind outrage and don't do anything to change anything. Its easier to incite more outrage than incite change
Can you be more explicit? What is the way you feel like?
I see. Interesting.

Why don't you do that yourself rather than instigating others?
I'm bisexual and despite their delicious chicken I have not spent money at chick fil a for years because they fund anti lgbtq activism. I think it's pretty black and white. I've probably spent about 4 years of my life playing various diablo games daily (especially diablo 2, to a lesser extent 1, 3 was not too great) I was there paying for the expansion pack on diablo 2 the day it came out back in the day, but I will not be giving money to Blizzard anymore.
I mean, it at least means that you won‚Äôt let something small like ‚Äúthe oppression of other people‚Äù inconvenience you.
Tell me what company you buy your products from, Ill get back to you to tell you how many genocides you support.
People are there to have an enjoyable weekend away, messing with their enjoyment is gonna make them hate HK's cause more.

The crunch to get Witcher 3 out was pretty ridiculous and employees were basically forced to work day and night, 7 days a week, and no holidays or vacation to get it done. All while they skirted around some loose labor laws and paid their employees shit when compared to a US developer, which already isn't that well paying. They even admitted it was not humane after being lambasted about it in on employee/employer sites such as Glassdoor.
You can critise china on Battle.net.

I doubt you can do so on an official broadcast event by McDonalds, Valve or EA. People have been Critising China on Battle.net, people are running around with names like "FreeHongKong" and nothing is happening.

These sorts of bills are bunk and mean nothing. Most of the world "condemned" Russia for invading another country, but no one actually did anything to combat it.

The world is a pretty shitty place, besides what's going on in Hong Kong, there's also the chinese concentration Caps, North Korea, Chile, Venezuela and too many more to list.

When I come home, I might decide to chill out and watch a stream of a game I like, or the newest upload of some youtuber I like. I know what's going on in Hong Kong, I support the people there, but if I turn on a stream for Hearthstone, I'd like it to be about Hearthstone.

Do you really want every single media you watch, TV Shows, gaming tournaments etc to all involve a segment where one of the people does a message about their cause? How would you feel about a Chinese player coming on and doing a segment about how they support China and that it's not doing anything wrong? how about a Russian talking about the annexing of Crimea and how it's what the people wanted, or a North Korea getting to speak his piece about how great his country is?

There's a right place for all these things, everyone has a right to an opinion. an eSport gaming tournament live-stream is not that place.
>I disagree. The issue is that, currently, they have not apologized for what they did, only for getting caught doing it. They are giving apologies that are meaningless because they aren't address what they actually did wrong.

What is it that you feel was not addressed specifically enough?

Per [https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23185888/regarding-last-weekend-s-hearthstone-grandmasters-tournament](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23185888/regarding-last-weekend-s-hearthstone-grandmasters-tournament)
>I want to take a few minutes to talk to all of you about the Hearthstone Grandmasters tournament this past weekend. On Monday, we made the decision to take action against a player named blitzchung and two shoutcasters after the player shared his views on what‚Äôs happening in Hong Kong on our official broadcast channel.

This is them prefacing what they're talking about.

>We‚Äôve had a chance to pause, to listen to our community, and to reflect on what we could have done better. In hindsight, our process wasn‚Äôt adequate, and we reacted too quickly.

Fair enough, this isn't an apology. But it is acknowledgement that they reacted too quickly and too harshly. But you and I both know what that entire post was addressing. 

Per you
>Make up something that sounds related, but is not the thing people are actually angry about, and then release a PR speak apology about that, instead of apologizing for what you actually did.

What else unrelated could they possibly be referencing here? I understand how PR speak works and I know that the initial response to the backlash was was clearly executed in a very specific way. Virtually no publicly traded company in the world would have it any other way if they had a choice. They have shareholders and lawyers to answer to. 

That said, today *did* provide a more formal apology from JAB. 
>...We moved too quickly in our decision-making. And then, to make matters worse, we were too slow to talk with all of you.

>...And for that, I am sorry, and accept accountability.

This isn't a parent-child relationship. You're not going to get something akin to  "I'm sorry for taking your lipstick and dipping it in the toilet." They're going to be more general about it, but everyone knows exactly what they're talking about.
Lmao okay bud. I just find it funny that you think Blizzard is going to miss that "shit load" of your parents' money and it's going to effect them. The money you spent, and are now refusing to spend supposedly, is less than a drop in the bucket. But sure call me a Nihilist.
Thanks...?
No, getting so angry that others might not support said developer is strange. Play your games. Other people have real world shit to deal with.
Google surrendered 30% market share in the Chinese search business because they didn't want to be involved in the Chinese censorship complex.

https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html

Both Nike and Blizzard can sell their products in China without ethical problems as long as they don't actively assist in suppressing the voices of the people of China. If Blizzard merely sold games to China and allowed people from Hong Kong to voice themselves (in the same way as other minorities) then that'd be 100% okay and ethical.
[deleted]
It might be because i'm from Australia and we have a large Chinese population and Aussies can be pretty racist, so i notice it more often the racism towards just average citizens. Many of them seem nice enough, a bit clueless about China but that is 100% not their fault.
no, being wet is acknowledging that there is a problem   
the problem that they gained a lot of hate.   
The rain is what caused the problem.        
"The world has a problem and we should change that" is just as broad as a statement as Blizz's
Then don't sign the agreement. :) Not a difficult concept.
Is your timeline on this messed up? They gave him the punishment right away...it‚Äôs not like they gave him a slap on the wrist and then China threw a tantrum and then they banned him and took his winnings. I don‚Äôt agree with what they did but don‚Äôt distort the facts.
They are allowed to take a stance, because they can craft the messaging, plan for things, and frame the discussion. What they don't want is for political topics to be brought up randomly by participants in their events, because then they may need to run damage control and appease the parties that may be offended. It is their choice to offend people that are anti LGBT, it isn't Blitzchungs decision to bring political matters into a Blizzard event (well, it is, but only with the understanding it could lead to punishment).
Where is this magic list of things excluded from politics defined? I'm clearly out of the loop here. These are things that shouldn't be politics, but stating 'X isn't politics' isn't a meaningful statement.
Except America partakes in torture but I wonder what you‚Äôve done to stop that
you literally just told someone with family in Hong Kong that they don‚Äôt support Hong Kong because of the video game they play. this reddit comment brigade is ridiculous
50-100 is SUPER generous.
No one‚Äôs saying they didn‚Äôt show up, they‚Äôre saying it was pathetically small and kind of funny. 

It was like 10 people milling around the outside of the center. No one cared. 

Your responses don‚Äôt make sense to what you‚Äôre responding to.
So what are you doing besides trolling people who are doing something?
but i downvoted the bad game company on reddit! i stand with hong kong
I have. The player numbers on PoE are tiny compared to D3 and it‚Äôs already f2p. It‚Äôs not anywhere near as popular as Poe fans would like to believe.
So being;

1 critically acclaimed

2 massively popular

3 one of the best selling games of all time


means nothing because of your opinion? That might be the most reddit thing I‚Äôve ever heard
Never played 2 :0

I just remember becoming bored with throwing up on people as the witch doctor... Because that's all I ever had to do.
Slam. Dunk.
I think you've misunderstood me.

I was saying that the people which are done with Blizzard have already deleted their accounts, stopped buying games/merch from Blizzard, maybe even contacted their representatives/government about HK. I also said that these people don't have time and money to join a protest outside a glorified advertisement, and shouldn't have to go through a bunch of hoops to prove that they protest and are done with Blizzard.
Right but we need to do more then just help those closest to us, we need to build better communities and show the world we can work together and come to agreements and make our own world.
This was my general point. I honestly don‚Äôt care if you hold Blizzard in contempt because you‚Äôre right for multiple reasons, but when you start saying that that is the bar for caring about human rights, you‚Äôre being obtuse and presumptuous of people‚Äôs efforts to change elsewhere.
The caricature of a protestor you've built in your head is very detailed, or has this happened to you at one of the many protests you've attended?
https://thenib.com/mister-gotcha
Why don't you ask them?
[deleted]
But how can you even know it is most people? There is no real evidence of that, there are tons of people in the world.
I have donated money to several groups supporting the protests, I've wrote emails to my representatives in both the house and Senate and I've chosen not to spend any money or to support blizzard in anyway I can. I do care and I've done what I can to support what I believe in. You may not believe that but that's okay, at the end of the day I've done what I can to help and that's enough for me.
No you're generalizing and projecting your own opinions.
Which was generally my point, I don't care if you want to hand out t-shirts, I don't care if you want to wear a t-shirt support a cause, but don't shit on people for not taking your t-shirts because t-shirts don't actually accomplish anything.
> the guy above me said that handing out shirts is ‚Äúuseless‚Äù

Except I'm the guy above you, and that isn't what I said.

Never thought about activism in this way. Really makes you think.
Good for you, enjoy what you love.
> No, everything is inherently political because everything that we say and do affects other people, whether we realise it or not.

No it really doesn't. Stop interjecting politics into random shit.
Sure, "everything is political." That doesn't mean people want to live and breathe politics every minute of every day. People often play video games to *escape.* Going to Blizzcon is double escape because it's vacation *and* video games. By injecting politics into it, you're taking people away from their vacation. People don't like that. Whether they agree with the message or not, it's understandable that people don't want to see stuff like this on their vacation.


If you want to spread the human rights abuses message where it might make a difference, head over to /r/LateStageCapitalism where there's half a million communists that need to be reminded that communism is what the people of Hong Kong are fighting against.
way to bend reality however you want it. Nice job!
Yes, they apologized for Blitzchung's statement.

Blizzard didn't hoist a man onto the stage and force him to spout political slogans.
‚Äã
I disagree. Blizzard didn't side with China by *not* siding with Hong Kong. Blizzard sided with China by giving out excessive punishments to people who didn't deserve them, and standing by the Chinese government in the suppression of the Hong Kong message. Blizzard makes political statements when they use the LGBT community as a vehicle for distraction and free press, but the death of democracy in a country is off limits? It's easy to see a double standard there -- it's fine if the political statement makes us money, but as soon as it toes the line of what China deems acceptable we'll start doling out punishments.

I don't think that the NBA has handled the China situation perfectly, but at least the commissioner had the balls to stand up for freedom of speech despite the massive risks to their profit. That's how Blizzard SHOULD have handled this situation. "Blitzchung's statements do not represent Blizzard because Blizzard is not a political organization."
> no, but they put a man who they hoisted on stage on full blast because he did say something political

He knew what he signed up for.
nooooo, dont twist now

the *casters* hoisted them on stage and encouraged him to spout political stuff

the *casters* and *talent* both signed contracts that state that their topics of choice for conversation should not include anything political
This is what it sounds like when life hands you everything, to the point you can just sit on your lazy ass doing nothing good for the world and act like it's a virtue to post about how much you hate video game companies on reddit.
> That wasn't the point. The point is that all that we do has political connotations, from what we eat, what we wear, what entertainment we consume, etc.

No it really doesn't. Stop interjecting politics into random shit.
> Are you the kind of nutjob who doesn't actually have a point and just says random shit when his obtuseness is called out?

Interjecting politics randomly into everything is pretty invasive, I thought you would understand it if I made a comparison most people have encountered.

You HAVE used a restroom before, right? You understand it locks for a reason?
No one's defending blizzard in the thread just the outcome of using your freedom of speech. Free speech allows me to go on public land and scream I hate all "insert group of people" and not get anything done to them by the government. But that means certain private corps like Google has deny me service. 

Yeah I know one example is someone being a racist and someone fighting for people's rights but they still both fall under usage of free speech
look up freedom of speech in your constitution kek
Ah, insane. That explains it
You just proved my point again. Bad parents.
I'm not protesting.
[removed]
I‚Äôm not bi but I believe other people should have rights no matter what their sexual orientation is. No sandwich is good enough for me to compromise on that.
Why wait? You can start doing the research and sharing it now. Would love to know if there are companies doing unethical things - also open to hearing about companies who do good things. You seem super passionate about it so get to work!
Good old "whataboutism" in full force from the pro-China troll.
Sorry about your feelings
"People are dying!" "Yeah, but what about overwatch?"
I bought my phone before the app got removed. Why should I conform to a purity test? Every effort helps - climate change is bad but I still drive my car. I do good when I can and choosing to not support a video game developer is about as low effort as it gets. Same goes for not watching the NBA. I‚Äôll do what I can, when I can and that‚Äôs all that matters. It doesn‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù. Honestly, no one NEEDS to play this game.
And everyone here is already aware. It's nothing but preaching to the choir. Endless talk on the internet isn't helping. They need resources.
Jesus Christ you need to look in their mirror, kid. You did everything you accused me of. You started with personal attacks. I'm merely saying that the protests at Blizzcon are misguided. Use the time, energy and resources to directly support those protesting in Hong Kong. They need food, financial support, first aid supplies, masks, goggles, funds for medical care etc. They don't need memes.
Can‚Äôt get me. I punched a Chinese cop in the face yesterday so
You did it first
Delete this nephew

Edit: nice lol he listened
The difference being Poland isn‚Äôt a totalitarian state - there‚Äôs no government pressure to silence the people talking about it. No one is being arrested or beaten in the streets because of this issue. It‚Äôs something they‚Äôve admitted and have addressed with C2077, and it‚Äôs great people are talking about it but again - no where near the level of ‚Äúhelping censor the discussion of human rights violations‚Äù so good to mention and for everyone to know but not even nearly the same thing.
Well, you‚Äôre lucky you have the freedom to chose and ignore whatever you want. You‚Äôre lucky you have the freedom to have this conversation. If you don‚Äôt give enough of a shit to make a small concession in your daily comfort, then that‚Äôs your right to do it. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm going to make every effort to get the word out. If McDonald‚Äôs decides to fire some employee for supporting Hong Kong, I‚Äôll continue to not eat their shitty food. Look dude, I‚Äôm a gamer, it‚Äôs where I spend my money on hobbies - I‚Äôve been gaming since 1990, and it‚Äôs the easiest and most lucrative influence I can make on an issue which is why this one resonates with me and many others. I‚Äôve enjoyed and own many blizzard games, and I want them to know what their allegiance to totalitarian China is going to cost them. That‚Äôs all it is.
... whatever man. If you can't see how much of a non-apology about that is, especially in light of the fact that they are still doing the thing you claim they are apologizing for, then your head is stuck so far into the sand that an entire excavation company wouldn't be able to dig you out.
Overwatch, Diablo 4, WOW and hearthstone are all franchises I‚Äôve played and spent a ton on and these games were ones would have gladly tossed hundreds of dollars into on the base game, Dlc and microtransactions. I‚Äôm an adult with a ton of disposable income and this is my main hobby. That money will now go elsewhere.

And you are a nihilist, you don‚Äôt care about anything and are annoyed by people who do. It‚Äôs a pathetic existence, a waste of humanity and a major contribution to what is wrong with this country. I can tell you think it‚Äôs edgy and cool not to care, to just want to play video games but off your shitstained couch and outside your dingy shack there‚Äôs a world of people out there who need help. They‚Äôre suffering and being censored. And sure there‚Äôs more suffering than any 1 of us can fix, but the good news is that you can make an impact just by not playing these games until Blizzard admits their mistake and stops censoring players. It‚Äôs so moronically easy - all you have to do is play any number of other games that are probably better. Sure lots of companies have their weak spots but this one is public and it‚Äôs happening now and there‚Äôs a movement to do something about it, so come show your support and maybe we can make a small but meaningful difference. First blizzard, then the nba, then, I dunno, apple?, then who knows who‚Äôs next - but it would be pretty cool to see it happen.
Ok Nihilist.
How‚Äôd that work out for them?
Civil rights are being violated and Hong Kong is being encroached upon, and you're concerned about property? Lol

Some things are more important than property. The Chinese government is doing several orders of magnitude more harm than the protestors.
Don't pander to a murderous authoritarian government :) Not a difficult concept.
Uh.... You dont get a pass for putting immoral shit in your TOS just because some people are required to sign it to make money from their job. 

Just because someone needs to sign to make their money doesnt make the contract magically clean and clear
I think you are the one confused, I am not distorting anything. They didn‚Äôt ban him on the spot, it happened after the tournament ended. Ie: China threw their tantrum after it happened and before he was banned; hence, the net ease post happening at the exact time he was banned.
Listen buddy, i hate to break it to you but all of these things these companies are doing are purely business decisions. It's about the money, and the money > morals and values and integrity. The LGBT stuff was exactly the same thing. Blizzard is not alone in this at all either.

I'm not taking a stance here, i'm just stating the facts. When it comes down to it, money trumps values every single time, and if you look at world history you can see that pattern again and again. 

Values seem to be just an opiate for the masses that they pretend to hold to keep them from rising up and disrupting the system that makes them wealthy.
While any issue can be political one, the case against torture and murder is settled. There's no reason to refer to human rights as political issues because they shouldn't need discussion: they're human rights.
It doesn't matter what I have or haven't done. The argument that human rights are not politics still stands. The free world has settled that particular political issue.
Your comment implies that either you are okay with torture, or you think the average american has a path to prevent torture that they can but arent taking. 

So assuming you arent literally evil, what do you expect the average american do aside from attempting to vote in politicians who are anti torture?
It's incredible how you read all that and came to that conclusion. I'm Cuban, my country also spews that bullshit communist stuff. If my favorite Cuban musician said he loved Castro or Raul I'd stop listening in a heartbeat. And it has happened before. You make it seem like it's just Blizzard bending the knee, but it's a ton of companies like Amazon, Apple, the NBA, ect. How long does this go on until we say enough? When China controls all gaming? The top game right now, which is Fortnite, is practically owned by Tencent. Tencent runs a ton of online services that censor a lot and gather data for the CCP. The point of the boycott isn't just about Blizzard, but China's influence as a whole.

Also just because he has family in China doesn't mean I'm not allowed to talk about an issue also affecting North America.
I like being kind.
I never claimed to be doing anything in the first place.  You sure are some self righteous dorks.
Then you‚Äôre lying, because PoE has a more active playerbase, a more active forum, a more active sub, higher stream viewer counts and a lot more content for each league compared to D3‚Äôs seasons.
You are redirecting. I just made a point about how wii fit has sold 50% more copies than D3 to illustrate that copies sold are not a great gauge.

The playerbase died quite quickly, so I wouldn't talk about it being critically acclaimed. Also if you're talking about critic praise, they'll praise just about any triple AAA title that pays them.

The community was very unhappy with a lot of the design choices. So they left. Why do they not publish player populations? Because it would hurt their numbers.

D3 is not the rock to die on my friend. If you enjoyed it good for you. But the player population over time got incredibly bad except on SEA servers.
No we are mocking at people who making this protest as wasting their time. Literally this entire protest mean so little it accomplish nothing. 25k dollars wasted to yell at air. Not only Blizzard wont even be able to take action, many people already move on with their newest release. 

We are not mocking their committment but their action. They are proving again this entire thing stop being about hong kong more about bandwagon. 

Hell this exact same protest post event got deleted on r/Hongkong
Someone literally said that in this comment chain.......
I'm asking you, you seem to have pretty strong opinions about it.
People can protest Hong Kong however they want and I fully support that. What China is trying to do there is terrible. If you want to burn all your Blizzard merch and delete all their games as your way of supporting them, that's fine.

But don't be the smoker who has given it up and suddenly gets in everyone elses faces about how terrible of a human they are because they smoke. Not everyone is going to choose to die on the same hill.

That's all i'm saying. Other people aren't the literal incarnation of the devil just because they keep playing WoW or Overwatch. Maybe they have chosen to boycott apple or tossed out their Nike's or dropped support of any number of the hundreds of companies that actively do business in China.
One only needs to look at the world today. Of the billions, how many are willing to stand by their values, when called to stand with others who are seeking those same values? Of the billions, how many are willing take action? And of the billions, how many are wiling to give up something they love, if it means to stand by their values or to help others obtain theirs? 

By no means, do I say that no ones exists that follows the above questions. Only that few do, when compared to the billions who exists. Take a look at recent events, how many took action to oppose organizations who are willing support or overlook injustice for the sake of profit? Where those that decided to take action, enough to sway the organizations path? Was there enough people, to sway the organizations path?

Yet we see still, organizations continuing on their path, shaken but steady. Of all the recent events, of all the organizations, how many have changed their course because people said "no"?
To be fair, if most people just ignored them then that‚Äôs a pretty strong case to his point.

You're currently supporting China thru Reddit lmfao did you forget about Tencent or did you ignore it?
Studies show most people don‚Äôt. Over half of Americans are ignorant of their political system left alone another country‚Äôs political system.

They seem pretty close to me. I'll edit "hand out" to "wear" if you want.
Oh I am totally pro hardline action, and agree to that point, but if you are out of reach of "action" doing something for awareness is entirely viable and helpful.
>communism is what the people of Hong Kong are fighting against.

There it is, the dumbest take I've seen today.
https://i.redd.it/3innty5cmjr31.jpg
Ah yes, ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt allow the Chinese government to extradite me and my fellow citizens to concentration camps‚Äù is a renegade political statement.

Jesus, I knew people would start defending Blizzard‚Äôs actions eventually, but I didn‚Äôt think it would happen this soon.
Diets are political, some animals/plants are illegal to eat. Wearing different brands is political, companies use slave labor to make cheap goods. Entertainment is extremely political inherently as it injects the opinions of the creators.
What we eat and wear impacts the environment. What we eat and wear can support certain types of exploitation of workers.

Do you just want to ignore reports about people killing themselves over working conditions? Including those making our Iphones? The ostrich approach of sticking our head in the sand and pretending all is fine is less than truthful. We can and should do better - starting by acknowledging these problems, and doing a very small minimum action.
Denial is not just a river in egypt, it turns out
Well it does in a lot of ways but not that directly. For example creating trash we can't recycle will create long term evironmental problems, and buying all our clothes and toys from china just supports their poor working conditions and wages. most things in general don't have to be political but most people choose to not think about the things they're contributing to because its normal for them.
It really does, though. Just because you‚Äôre either willfully or hopelessly ignorant of it doesn‚Äôt make it true.
So you are that kind of person.
If he signed a contract there is no freedom.
Ah, incapable of rational argument, that explains it.
So what are some of the examples of disruption that you think is good?
of course youre not, dont wanna actually get any reprecussions for what you try and get people to do ay
You need help
I can already tell you that if you own a phone, you essentially support slavery. But I wanted to hear about you specifically, because you 100% seem like a hypocritical slacktivist on his high horse.
Yes they do, but people who already bought their tickets and also choose to protest in some way inside the event are raising awareness in a place where they are not supposed to.

You can‚Äôt expect people to hand over money that they can‚Äôt get back in the first place.
Punishing a player for using the company's platform to push a world view vs treating employees like shit to get their product out. Yep, they really aren't the same thing. One is much worse but it isn't the hip reddit circlejerk right now so keep on with your Blizz hate. I'm sure they'll shed a whole lot of tears over your dumbass.
Lmao you are hilarious. I'll repeat what I said at very beginning. Get a hold of yourself bud.

Adult with ton of disposable income? Doubt it.

How is it immoral to require players to stay focused on the game? Would you have found it immoral if they punished a holocaust denier or a white supremacist for using Blizzard‚Äôs broadcasts to spread their views? Just because the view which was expressed was one that you and I agree with doesn‚Äôt mean players should be free to bring whatever political agenda they want into a game. Kibbler‚Äôs post on this whole thing was the best one I‚Äôve seen so far - Blitzchung was brave to do what he did but he did violate his contract, and Blizzard was right for punishing him but the original punishment was disproportionately harsh.
Just as there's no proof that China didn't have any involvement with the decision, there's also no proof  that they did.

Blizzard can't take a stance on this issue as a company unless it's voted on. And I bet after having a few people decide to ban Blitzchung without considering the brand image, they are even more afraid to support it because it may damage their image even more.

Think about it this way. The gay pride thing that was referenced a while ago was less of a controversial political issue than HK. It didn't really involve governments and it was pretty widely accepted. Not to mention, it wasn't thrown out randomly at the end of an event.

Think about it this way. What if someone at the end of the Overwatch Cup said, "Trump 2020!"

Based on their rules, they would be banned? Yeah. Would people care? Probably not because most people hate Trump and the topic isn't as controversial as HK.
The tournament was already over when he was doing the interview lmao. And of course they didn‚Äôt do it on the spot, I never said they did.
I'm not sure what this is in response to, I never said it wasn't about money, and I never said anything about them having good values. I was making points about terms of service, Blizzards right to have a say in the way that their events are run, and the fact that they have been attempting to take steps in the right direction without fully giving in and opening the door for political speeches after every win.
But this is still political for China. Does China just not count? I know that the preferred answer on Reddit is for all of these companies to pull out of China and stop doing business with those billion people, but that isn't always a tenable answer.
It just seems a bit silly making all this effort for a country hundreds of miles away but not bothering about some of these domestic issues which have been going on for centuries
My comment was in response to your gatekeeping who is and who is not for Hong Kong. You told *him* specifically he can't say he supports Hong Kong based on the video game he plays. His family does not matter. It is the game he plays.

Are you trying to now say he also can't support HK it if he likes Amazon, Apple, and the NBA?
So you're not doing shit, and mocking others for doing anything. Got it. Listen, narcissist-just because something may not be a problem to you doesn't mean it's not a problem. Get over yourself. You're not that important. You don't get to whine and dictate what other folks care about. If you truly don't care, try shutting up.
30 million copies sold vs a redditors feelings. Big thonkers
Then I'm not talking about you, and then you made both of us waste our time arguing.
Yes, a portion of that crowd is probably ignoring them but another part of that crowd is more then likely uninformed about the situation. whether or not they end up finding more information on the subject is entirely up to them but never attribute to maliciousness what is more than likely  just plain ignorance.
That is very much a hotly debated opinion that deals with the basics of human nature. I'm not really super informed on the subject outside of basic psychology and sociology classes I took. The little i do know though says it's far from a settled opinion or fact.
???? What does that have to do with the situation at hand? Yes Tencent does own a share of Reddit, but that doesn't mean I support them or their actions. I pay no money to use Reddit and it's not like me being on this website will fill their coffers. I don't even give them ad revenue because I use a third party app to access it. The most they get from me is another tick up on their traffic count.
*jumps to conclusions*
It seems like you are too dense to follow my point, have a nice day.
I disagree.

Non-action is what people do when they have no intention of actually helping. 

I will ask you this; can you name something feasible that could be done by average folks to help those in HK?
What are they fighting against if not the oppression of Communist China?

I'm sorry to hear that you've lived a sheltered, ignorant life. Go learn some things about the world and come back.
Do what myself then?
Oh man, this is a big brain take. I wouldn‚Äôt call it slackitivism if I‚Äôm a gamer and I‚Äôm actually boycotting something I would otherwise play. That‚Äôs actually making an impact. I‚Äôve been a very active player of overwatch, Diablo 2 & 3, hearthstone and wow, and now I‚Äôm not going to play them anymore and I‚Äôm spreading the word. Make whatever judgement you want but I know that the few hundreds of dollars I would be spending on these games, Dlc and micro transactions will now go to other games and developers. I‚Äôll take my hobby elsewhere and recommend that others do too. Too many great games out there right now to throw my money toward supporting this bs.
And yet blizzard still gets paid. They don't care. They get the ticket sale either way
Game companies have caves to pressure from their fans in the past and they‚Äôll do it again. I hope this is one of those times and until it is, I‚Äòll just play the dozens of other awesome games out there.
But I nailed your shit stained couch! You made my point for me. You don‚Äôt know much about me either so the ad hominem attacks are pointless. 

You are a nihilist though and it‚Äôs sad. Imagine thinking that caring about the suffering of people who want to live free from authoritarianism aren‚Äôt even worth OTHER people‚Äôs attention... you must think pretty little of yourself if you think other people in this situation shouldn‚Äôt be shown support on an online discussion forum.

With all the documented cases of police brutality, why are you going so far out of your way to convince people that some of the protestors might also be bad people?
The "dont talk about politics" is a lie, dude. They actively discuss and even promote political topics. 

Or did you forget that they did the whole corporate pride dance only a handful of months ago? 

LGBT people and topics are banned in tons of countries bilzz operates in. Why was that political movement considered kosher, if they have a written contract forbidding employees, players, and associates from discussing politics of any kind? 

Its cause they pick and choose when the rules matter, like when chinese censors threaten action for an anti state message is promoted. 

Its not about following the rules. Blizz already broke them.
I love that comparison. I would bet all the money I have that if someone said ‚Äútrump 2020‚Äù the ban would not have been this severe.
Right that would be the only scenario where your response is relevant.
And what, praytell, are these "steps" that they are taking, and what makes you think these "steps" are even close to the right direction. Because I've seen absolutely nothing, except two really shitty and obviously insincere apologies. Words, nothing more.
30 million copies that leaves the entire dev team with a skeleton crew that can‚Äôt create any real contents for 5 years.

Listen, I‚Äôm not here to convince you, you can keep living under the rock and thinking that D3 is the most popular arpg in the market, I‚Äôm fine with that. I have met enough blizzard apologists that I know when is it the time to stop the conversation. 

Have a good day.
You are talking about the replier who complain about protest being pathetic. I am just showing that you are missing the point.
Fair point, but consider this. The people that go to conventions are generally the most invested in the hobby/interest of the convention. I find it hard to believe that the people that would go out of their way to get there wouldn‚Äôt be aware of such a huge issue with the company.

Invade China with our military and install our own democracy.
Put pressure on their government to support hk. If the world stands behind them China is more likely to back down.
>can you name something feasible that could be done by average folks to help those in HK?

Keeping the awareness for the happening alive with constantly pushing it into attention thus news media see it as a relevant topic to repeatedly make money from reporting about it as it remains in public interest. Which in turn will slowly make it more and more relevant as a national political topic and respective governments will follow with action.

&nbsp;

What would you suggest as alternative for those who can't take any action as there is no option available?
Yeah, asking people to stop spreading awareness about Hong Kong and preaching how useless it is. Oh wait that‚Äôs what YOU are doing, why are you so invested in stopping the spread of awareness?
China isn‚Äôt communist
If someone posts something on behalf of your studio, and you not denying that - it's obviously that you supporting the statement.

Willfully ignoring political issues so you can enjoy a video game sounds a lot more ignorant than whatever you just tried to accuse me of.

By defending Blizzard‚Äôs actions, you are telling the people of Hong Kong that you don‚Äôt want their suffering to get in the way of your good time.
If I fight back against someone trying to kill me, are you going to tell me not to because fighting back is associated with bloodshed?  Is bending over for every oppressive regime the way to go because fighting back is associated with bloodshed?
I'm sure the 10th time you copy and paste this response is the one that will convince anyone.
"please stop trying to make me thing of the impact i have on the world"
how much social credit di u get for doing this may i ask?
Politics is literally part of every consumerist activity. There are politics to get games made, politics to sell the games, politics for those who consume them. Gaming is a huge field full of capitalist exploitation. People in game development are extremely exploited. All of this is political. 

Video games have politics in them too. Just because you are too thick skulled to understand that *everything* from the water you drink to the movies you watch are political doesn't mean they aren't.
...f
Please keep going.
Says the guy adamantly trying to bury his head in the sand because he can't do without a specific video game.

You're pathetic.
You said that if you buy blood diamonds you support ethnic cleansing, therefore you think that buying blizzard games supports China. Why did you not respond to the fact that you support slavery and genocide? Why do you think that just because people arent interested in reddits outrage of the month they WANT to support China?

Someone else said it in this thread before me but I can‚Äôt find their comment right now - there‚Äôs a huge difference between taking a conscious decision as a company to support a thing and carefully crafting a campaign around it, and setting a precedent that Blizzard-run streams can be used as a platform for any person to state their political views at any time. The risk involved with the second one is unacceptable to pretty much any company, and the fact that they were trying to set a precedent probably was part of the reason the initial punishment was way too harsh.

>	Its not about following the rules. Blizz already broke them.

Just because they put something in a contract that others voluntarily sign doesn‚Äôt mean it applies to every way in which they run their business.
To be clear, I'm suggesting that if a player said "Trump 2020", they would've gotten the same 1 year ban and no prize money, but the general public wouldn't give two shits about it and we would've forgotten about it after two days.
So you didn't know they gave back the prize money and changed the bans on the player and casters to 6 months?
I‚Äôm glad your feelings have more validity than actual game sales. You think you can cash them in for prizes?
Fair point as well but there is a difference in being aware of a situation and being knowledgable enough to have a valid opinion.
 Now this is purely ancedotal so take it with a grain of salt , but recently I sat down and had a conversation with a friend who was very much in Blizzard's corner on the topic of the Blitzchung decision, but the more we talked the more I realized he had little knowledge on the subject outside of headlines. So instead of debating with him I just gave him information and linked him to a few articles on the protests and why they were happening. While he isn't boycotting blizzard, he has changed his opinion on whether blizzards action we're justifiable in that situation.
Now I'm not saying every single person who walked in and ignored the protesters was ignorant on the situation, I do believe a decent chunk of those people are under informed on the subject.
Whatever you say guy replying to 4 day old comment chain.
I mean, I am all for democracy but that is all I know. After reading about mainland Chinese and their perspective, they like what they have. So, that begs the question ‚ÄúWhy is it up to us to force our way of life on those not asking for it?‚Äù

Historically, the United States has a very bad record when it comes to trying to invade a nation and force our political ideology.
It sounds good in theory, but China would only bow to a complete economic cutoff. We would have to coordinate a total denial of Chinese imports to budge them.
Nope. Try again.

Making random shit up is a sign of greater ignorance still. I truly didn't know it was possible for someone to be this sheltered.
I never said the movement was perfect. Again, with all the documented police brutality that is happening in Hong Kong, why are you so set on convincing people that some of the protestors are bad people?
Yeah, I got that. I am just saying the opposite.
You make a really good point. At the end of the day who knows what the actual reason for the indifference is, but thank you for having a respectful conversation about it.
Oh I wasn't aware you were looking for a reasonable and plausible idea.....just an idea lol. 

It is indeed not up to us but if we're all being honest China and its people would be much happier under a constitution and democracy.
This became a black and white issue when Blizzard HQ did not disavow or retract a statement made on THEIR game's official social media on THEIR BRAND. Not only that, they tried to double down on the "this has nothing to do with China" angle while not disavowing "we will always defend the nation's dignity".`No matey, this became a black and white issue when Blizzard still owns the Hearthstone brand. Their silence and deliberate ignoring of the weibo statement, thus letting it stand as official statement of THEIR GAME, is complicity at best, collusion at worst.
Better than pretending that everything in life can be apolitical.
i'm sorry that you want to stay so sheltered from the world
how much tho
Just chiming in because I'm not sure if you are aware that repeating yourself in the face of several lengthy, thought-out, respectful responses rather makes you sound like a child.
Two much dedication to the blade I see.
I appreciate your willingness to discuss the civilly as well, nothing can be accomplished if all we do is scream at each other.
They might be happier with democracy but they most likely would never allow you to get them there. Mainland Chinese are taught from birth that how we live is bad and selfish and how they live is good and right for all. So, you aren‚Äôt even fighting the Chinese government or military, you are fighting what the people believe. That is a pretty tough task to overcome.
That's a pretty emotional response but you do you buddy.

The translation also says "all nations' dignity". Not China's.

but hey, internet outrage machine didn't tell you that, did it?

PS before you make a stupid reply, Hong Kong is not a nation and never has been.

A video game tournament sure can be. Except idiots like you keep trying to belly-flop into the crowd screaming shit about how righteous you are. So righteous you're doing your best to try and wreck the place.

That one's free. For the rest I suggest starting at an elementary school.
Like all things it will take time. But 1 maybe 2 generations that thinking will be gone forever.
It might be an emotional response, but everything he said was right and exactly how and why it happened.
I mean, he's right.
It says the nation's dignity. Don't try to fool me, I'm a native Chinese reader. It's also posted on weibo to mainland China's audience. If you think this somehow means they're gonna defend the dignity of, idk, Venezuela, I've got a bridge on Mars I'd like to sell you.
You're right.  Video games have never had innate political statements.
but how much?
I don't think anyone suggested something as far flung as nose picking for political action. I agree that there are some political conversations I don't care to have. For example: is the meat industry bad/immoral/harming the environment? Probably, but I don't have room in my head to be "woke" on that front. I find the causes I care about, and I speak to those.

All that to say, I understand not wanting this (or any) political issue in your video game conversations. For some people though, this is the cause they care about. Best to ignore and speak to the issues you care about rather than tell people to stop representing their beliefs, in my opinion.
zzz
No doubt there. The hard part though is getting that first generation to even listen. From what I have read on here, supposedly posted by Chinese citizens, mainlanders put on a show for everyone but deep down, they love China and their way of life. So, Mt. Everest to climb.

I don't particularly mind it, considering any artistic medium I partake in is bound to have some political messaging inherent within it.

Employees covered that this morning in protest from what I saw on Twitter earlier.
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EGYGUGcU0AEFn_p?format=png&name=small
The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: ÂÖ≠Âõõ‰∫ã‰ª∂, li√πs√¨ sh√¨ji√†n), were student-led demonstrations in Beijing (the capital of the People's Republic of China) for the establishment of basic human and press rights and against the Communist-led Chinese government in mid-1989. More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: ÂÖ´‰πùÊ∞ëËøê, bƒÅji«î m√≠ny√πn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.

Aparantly not
The funny thing is the Orc statue was made in China.

First Thing‚Äôs First: Modeling
A team in New Zealand scanned the original 12-inch tall statuette and created a virtual 3D model

Up Next: Details, Details, Details
The 3D model was then sent to a manufacturing center in China, where the artists sculpted, molded, cast, waxed, bronzed, welded, and buffed to turn the virtual presentation into a 12 foot tall statue.

Last, but Not Least: Delivery
The massive sculpture was transported from China to Irvine using a custom-built steel dolly and shipping container, and set into place with a crane.

I find HILARIOUS that everyone is now acting all shocked at blizzard, pointing out that kind of shit, while ignoring the fact that they have been working overtime to ban and mute people not being ultra PC in their games.

I guess the freedom of speech only matter when you agree with what's being said, amirit?

...for the horde.
Paper ain‚Äôt gonna cut it, someone go shit on it or pour cement on it
Someone needs to get a big truck, put a hook around that statue and Saddam topple it down
Not even the same placard though? Even the backgrounds are different colors.
Disclaimer, I by no means support Blizzard's response. The way they responded to a rule infraction was terrible and underscores how the company is continuing to change for the worse.

With regards to the plaque however, if trying to be objective, you can rationalize the phrase "every voice matters"  is centered on developing a video game. Meaning, anyone at Blizzard is welcome to provide input, regardless of his or her role in the company.

Regardless of the above logic, I still can't support Blizzard. Valuing money over wanting to help the greater good is not for me.
Wait so even Blizz employees are pissed?
Fuel to the fire, classic blizzard.

Could we all agree to say fuck CCP instead of fuck China? I agree with sentiment, and fuck Xi for sure, I just think saying China sends the wrong message.

Haha I will post this every anti China thread. Even though I asked the question after the AMA ended.
The US govt has no business telling private corporations how to run their business when they're not breaking any state or federal laws.

The corporations need to be kept in check by the consumers. Don't like their business model? Stop supporting them. Vote with your wallet.

The US govt can support Hong Kong by putting economic sanctions on China, but the last time that was done, /r/politics and other leftist subs freaked out about how bad that'd be for our economy. Well, we can't have the cake and eat it too. 

The same goes for gamers and private corporations. Don't want Blizzard to take these shitty stances? Stop buying their shit!
Trump reportedly promised to Xi Jinping that he would remain quiet about the Hong Kong protests in return for a more favourable trade deal.
I laughed.Then felt bad for laughing.
I'm unironically glad that he got banned because it kickstarted a huge blowback and made who knows how many more thousand people aware of what is happening in Hong Kong. It was a heroic act!
 Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences.
can we get a poem about this?
Is this actually real? Like there is a literal monument at their headquarters that says this?
See Comisar for details.
Can I post it in r/hongkong ? Will give credit.
but tencent has both...
Nah. Most Chinese immigrants immigrate because they don't want that sort of life and government. Most overseas ethnic chinese (or at least i can say for the younger generation ones) dont identify with the country's politics and policy these days either. Dont mix the government with the people. The loudest voice in China are supportive if their government because ... U either keep silent or u will be silenced.

Yeah the only problem is China has A LOT more wallets.

Luckily there are many small gaming companies that make great games, even bigger ones like R\*. The passion for "clean" gaming hasn't died, it's just the big companies that got off "the human track" in their search for endless expansion...
Fuckin good on them if true
EVERY VOICE MATTERS. (unless it affects my pocketbook)
I agree. I am angry at and afraid of the chinese influence on this world, but it astounds me how many people are suprised. China literally has a billion more people than the US, of course a company in its search for endless expansion will look there. It also isn't something new that certain global players don't want any kind of political messages in their official media publishings, especially not if it is that controversial. As if blizzard has ever really cared for human rights? Why do people expect the epiphany of capitalistic companies to care about this kind of morals and ethics? Yeah "every voice matters" coming from a bloodthirsty autocrat ( also looking at you, Sylvanas). The horde keeps slaves and tortures their enemies. Oh the irony...

Blizzard is doing a good job of it themselves.
No need to give blizzard a reason to look anything but morally reprehensible which is how they look currently.
If you look around the base of the statue about a foot out or so it has 1 of the 8 "core values" etched into the cement it looks like.  Assuming that's what the top picture is.
Someone in the company is at least.
Former employees now probably.

At least they can't be extradited to China.
Fuck yeah they are. Most of my friends who've left the company did so because of how shitty the job has become due to new "chinese market focused" oversight. My bud who worked their for 5 years put in more overtime work than anyone on his WoW team, didn't see his family for like...3 months at the beginning of last year due to pre expansion work. He couldn't get a promotion even though he's well overdue. Moved to Hearthstone team, supposed to have a much clearer path, hardest worker and they wanted to promote him. Activision only allowed for 2 promotions within that branch this year, instead of the 5 Blizzard used to use. He left for Epic and is now out of state.

Very few employees feel like Blizzard has been living up to their values in the past few years, and the lines are split among those who are being paid serious bucks and those who are still scraping out a living.
Yes.
I‚Äôd imagine plenty are pissed, there‚Äôs tons of people that work at Blizzard Irvine it‚Äôs essentially a campus.
Why would you assume every Blizzard employee shares the same values and has the same reactions? Of course some of them are pissed, I'd assume a large majority are outraged and resentful of Blizzard for this move. This was a decision made in a boardroom, not by a company-wide vote.
Certainly, you've gotta keep in mind most of them are us, it's the higher-ups that pull bullshit like this.
Someone needs to saw that orcs head off, or harvest it‚Äôs kidneys.
Of course employees are pissed when their corporate overlords publicly break with the company's values for a quick buck.
Blizz employees are treated like garbage so they've probably been pissed for a while. Some live in their cars in the parking lot since the wages are barely enough to cover the cost of life around their headquarters. Contract terminations without warnings, poor work conditions in general... (Chinese?) stockholders have taken over Blizzard and made it a milk farm.
My brother's friend works at blizzard. He said basically everyone he knows there is not happy about it.
This is how google backed out of China. Internal pressure. Not external.
The only people you should be upset with in Blizzard are the head honchos. The normal devs aren't calling the shots in any way, shape, or form.
Of course they are. You really think that Blizzard employees support this shit? Most of them are just as pissed as we are.
Just because you work for a company doesnt mean you immediately agree with everything said Company does.
Of course. This decision wasn't made democratically, from the lower-level animators/developers.
Blizz employees are shit on nowadays just like the customers.
Why wouldnt they be? This is a "reasonable human" sort of thing
Why wouldn‚Äôt they be? Not everyone working for a company supports said companies ideology especially when its not known beforehand.
If we had classic blizzard we wouldn't be having these problems, post Activision it's been a god damned shit show.
Dumb comrade you copied the whole thing!  
  
-50 social points.   
Privilege to use bus and train for your family has been removed.    

( afaik this shit is real... you cant use public transit if your score is low )
I'm pretty sure those were separate plaques, you can see the "voice" one was embedded in the ground, not up like the one below the statue. The voice one is on the ground on the ring around the statue.

It's about the message dipshit
Shut the fuck up, idiot.
lol they downvote and dont get sarcasme gg hahah
More than you've done.
Xinnie the Wu
No man, fuck *CHINA*, I know that as a westerner it's hard to believe, but the majority of their nation is just as primitive as the government - and they're OK with it.

Just go watch any of the "gwailo" Chinese youtubers who archived their journeys and experiences (prime being laowhy/Winston) for over a decade, it really is illuminating and explains so much as to why they act so primitive and disgusting.

The government is only a symptom.
I'm going to kneel for Hong Kong
I agree wholeheartedly, people need to understand that the CCP and China in regards to her people and culture are different. Saying "fuck China" only hurts any progression to removing the CCP's control, Chinese citizens will see "fuck China" and see it as an attack on theirselves. We need the people of China to win this fight, we need them for the hopeful revolt to come in the future against the CCP. Yes there will be bigots who follow and support the CCP's rule, but understand that many Chinese citizens are being oppressed, their knowledge and critical abilities are hindered by just being born and brought up in China.

&#x200B;

Understand the true fight, don't let the CCP blindside who the real problem is like what they're doing in Hong Kong by trying to pit the Hong Kong demonstrators vs the HK Police, Government and Chinese people rather than the CCP itself.
Chinese people aren't stupid, they get the idea. If someone says "Fuck the US" I don't treat it as a personal attack.
Yeah, I 100% agree
Should be "Think GLobally' minus china.
you mean, Activison-Blizzard 

There is no just blizzard, they are one now.
that explain why they become so greedy.
Dollars aren't cool anymore, it's all about the yuan now.
Fuck trade with China. Any trade with China is a bad deal and we've had about 2 decades to see what happens when you give the totalitarian fascist regime of China access to Western markets.
If he hadn‚Äôt been banned, I doubt his statement would‚Äôve rallied many more people to the cause. But silencing him? That‚Äôs a hell of a shit storm, and goddamn did they get more people onto the independence train
Why would you use your freedom of speech if later your government got you arrested?
If the consequences of free speech is getting arrested for protesting the government it's not free speech. The HK protests started peacefully. The police state that China is implementing escalated the situation. This is 8946 all over again.
[Yup](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/21349313/the-orc-statue), with [eight core values](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/mission.html?blzcmp=blizzard-news)
Exactly.
Yes, like that. I wonder how widespread the account removals will really be.
Ohhhhh! Thanks man!
I messaged my friend who works there today. He‚Äôs more angry than I am. He says unless ‚Äúthey rectify their embarrassment of a business plan‚Äù he‚Äôs going to resign.

He works in OW QC, so it‚Äôs not just hearthstone feeling heat internally. He said he‚Äôd tell me how others are in a bit.

**EDIT UPDATE BECAUSE YOU ALL WANTED IT:**

My friend talked to his manager about it and got told ‚Äúit‚Äôs a developing situation not too relevant to Overwatch, so we don‚Äôt know anything more than you‚Äù (they segregate the shit out of their different teams based on tours I took). His two good friends are just as pissed off. Not nearly as exciting as it all sounds, but that‚Äôs usually reality; a boring dystopia.
Don't jinx them.
They can be sent on a business trip to China.

Then fired.
CS employees are protesting in Irvine.

 On another point, people sending death threats to CS employees are fucking  knee jerk assholes who don't understand the person making barely above minimum wage answering tickets has no say in what happens in tournaments
You have been banned from r/Beijing
Lol blizzard would probably swing that if China gave them even a shy smile.
You didnt read the fine print in the hiring package did you?
worth it
Former employees with an awesome potential for lawsuit $$. Heh.
Yet.
So from one chinese overlord to another or am i misunderstanding who Epic is?
>Activision only allowed for 2 promotions within that branch this year

As a business owner, this is bizarrely triggering. As if a promotion is purely an incentive to be sprinkled delicately, and not a better utilization of a person that may require more facilitation from the business. If you can spend more to optimize the effectiveness of someone in a better position with a positive cost/benefit, you do it. Limiting your business in that capacity for any reason other than budget would be absurd.

I'm also implying that they have the resource to absorb investment cost in themselves, but i wager that's a safe call, even though I'd be talking out of my ass to assume that.
Also, I just got word that Blizzard is planning on setting up extended barriers for protesters at the convention center for Blizzcon. They are expecting protests, they don't plan on doing anything to curb the issues, it seems.
>left for Epic  

Talk about moving sideways.
It's showing in their games, WoW is fucking trash. Relaunching the work of their predecessors is pretty telling.
Welcome to every other job.
I do think we're not talking about Activision's part in this enough, there was a reason Bungie was popping Champagne the day they got out from under Activision. A lot of the most nickel-and-dimeing practices come from them, and I wouldn't be shocked if these policies came from Activsion, not Blizzard.
Well, at least there's that
Blizzard is actually the world's largest jury and decisions are only made once unanimous.
^‚ÄúBacked ^out‚Äù
"backed out"
Backed out? They're working on a fucking China-safe search engine.
Yea - Blizzard pre-Activision was awesome. Ever since the merger / sell-out things have gone down-hill :(
Yup. They do.

Thank you !
You dont say!  I'm merely reflecting on how cheaply they covered it up.
I was going for some good old fashioned British humor.  But what I got was an epic gamer moment...  I'm gonna use the N word!
Your right, I've done almost nothing to protect the blatant hypocrisy of a million dollar corporation....  the fuck you talking about?
No, most of them ain‚Äôt going to go against CCP.

I understand what you mean but it seems that you have no idea of how fucking corrupted Chinese people are. 

Just want to say, patriotism ain‚Äôt a bad thing, but look at Chinese people and their ‚Äúpatriotism‚Äù bullshit in recents incidents, like the NBA one. You‚Äôll understand why they are unredeemable.
Yeah but it seems it's because of Activision that blizzard does this shit since it started when they merged so I blame mostly Activision
Blizzard apologists will eventually say that this was Blizzard's master plan.
Did they get arrested?

Feels to me like they made a statement and suffered the consequences. Just like when people have made dumb statements against LGBT here in the West, they say it, then suffer the consequences. 

That's how it works.
 The commentators and HS player weren't arrested. 

They just faced the consequences for their statement, same as if you got on TV and started railing against LGBT.
Those went out the window faster than googles "don't be evil".
Jeez.
If my conversation with the call-center woman was any indication, they got a lot of those requests today.
Definitely want to hear about this.
[deleted]
It‚Äôs about to become an OW issue if the internet gets their way with making Mei a symbol of resistance.
Saved for later, please report back :)
>Please, keep us posted - I'm also very curious about the situation inside Blizzard.
I've followed Overwatch pretty hardcore for the last 3 years.

Jeff and his team probably are furious. Overwatch is just a game, but there's no doubt that they believe the stuff they're putting out. Freedom for all and such.
Can‚Äôt wait for a follow up!
Also shamelessly saved for later. Thanks for the info, say hi to the friend.
Leaving my tactical dot for a follow-up!

.
Thanks for the update :)
Just to be clear if blizzard lose the chinese market your friend and a lot more people in that building will lose their jobs, WoW have 70% subscription based on the chinese servers, just to nane one game, so the blizzard employee have the right to quit their jobs because they the CeO and excutive people did what they did otherwise they wouldn't have a choise to leave their jobs.
Funnily enough it‚Äôs about to get just a little more relevant to Overwatch.
Keep us updated please
Well since that Mei character is involved now. Overwatch is becoming of relevance. The sheer number of upvotes on that part is prett impressive.
Tell your friend to stop watching fake news and do some research on what‚Äôs really happening in hk before ruining his career.
>they segregate

Very progressive. Really taking notes from China. Next they'll be sending muslim employees to conversion camps and telling them to give up their religion or be imprisoned/worked to death
Ayyy lmao
don't Xi'nx them
Fired for no-showing after you disappeared.
with their passports taken away? D:
I mean, he's didn't leave for morally based reasons, they're just the company that provided him the promotion and almost doubled his salary. People who work at these companies know that what the company is doing is shitty, but they still have to put food on the table. They're not rich, most entry Blizz positions get paid ~60k, which for Ca is not enough to live on.

It's dumb to think that these people aren't just more disenfranchised workers doing what they can with the careers they've been forging.
[deleted]
Epic is 51% owned by their American CEO. They are not publicly traded.
They absolutely thrive on "blizzard incentives" at the moment. Hiring people who are passionate about their games isn't just a method to keep their games churning out good content, it's also a way of making sure they want to stay for the yearly Blizzard bucks or "fun atmosphere" around campus. 

I can't personally speak to the specifics of the interior decision making behind this, but I do know that before he stepped down, Morhaim was actively trying to buy back Blizzard from Activision in attempt to return to their own interests. He was not able to do that, obviously, and that was a huge factor for his resignation.
[removed]
Lmao God that's going to be such a shit show.
In regards to?
I mean, as much as I think it's ridiculous, people have been clamoring for WoW classic for almost a decade. It just became a priority recently because Blizzard shut down the unofficial servers.
That's why I play FFXIV these days. It's leagues ahead of WoW and only getting stronger.
Dammit you beat me by about 15s posting the exact same thing
And your point is still retarded...
I agree that many are in a state of pro CCP, however a lot of people are in the 'neutral' or "I don't really care right now" stance alongside those who are against the CCP but do so quietly. So unless you can back up your claim that most of them won't go against the CCP then I'm afraid I have to disagree with you.

Well I myself am Chinese or more specifically a Hong Konger in this context by heritage. Grew up within the culture, visit China and Hong Kong annually for leisure and work. So I'd like to think that I have some experience about China and it's culture, values etc. More so than the average person, what I'm seeing from your comment is a lot of generalising though. You can't just make a claim that all Chinese people are corrupt. You only think that because that's probably all you hear about the Chinese. But I've spoken, studied and worked with plenty of reputable and rational Chinese people. These will be the same people who with join and lead the movement from within China.

However this is also why I am pessimistic about the outcome of Hong Kong right now. The CCP can't let Hong Kong win this battle. If they do then others in China may feel empowered and see it as a real chance for them to do the same. Once that happens, the CCP is over. That's why in my opinion the CCP will do whatever it takes to crush this movement in Hong Kong even if it leads to more escalation and bloodshed. It's evident that the global parties of the world aren't going to do anything. No country is willing to sacrifice their economic relationship with China because all in all, it's about economics and money. Hong Kong is waiting to be swallowed up, it's not a case of will it, but when.

TL;DR don't generalise, these are the exact reasons I stated in my previous comment that will only further the gap and relations with the people we need on our side.
I blame the money more and the fact the old staff is gone.
They chose to merge because of the money. Dont pretend like blizzard was manipulated into becoming this. And anyone who didn't approve would easily find jobs elsewhere as blizzard was a juggernaut in the industry.
Sweet summer child. You really think Blizzard would have acted any different on its own, when millions of dollars are on the line? 

Don‚Äôt give them convenient excuses. They would have done exactly the same.
Yeah it works in the west, not in the authoritarian government that china is.
And by stealing his prize money, and firing the commentators for just happening to be on stream. Blizzard sent a message that they stand with a dictatorship that is commiting a genocide. Over the ideals of the country they were founded in. Which is the issue.
**Electronic Arts has entered the chat.**
The different game teams are quite different in terms of culture - is not be surprised if the OW team had the most anger right now, based on the people I know (though that‚Äôs obviously anecdotal)
Seeing as their core beliefs were ‚Äúwe aren‚Äôt here to create money. We‚Äôre here to create gaming experiences and to bring joy to this world‚Äù according to my friends, I think they‚Äôd rather leave.
We have a group of friends in HK - I e said it before.

We are well aware of what is happening.
Dude they split up teams for secrecy and leak recognition reasons. - they‚Äôre doing enough dodge shit without that. Think about it - why should a hearthstone junior game tester have access to the wow content that is sensitive content?
Ayyy lm kidneys off
Fired and then charged the family for the bullet fee.
They‚Äôre not doing anything shitty. And you‚Äôre right I was merely checking if i understood right.
Isn't Blizzard in Austin? Just curious. 60k still isn't a lot, but its a lot more in TX, than in CA (Lived in texas for 15 years, have lived in CA before that, and for the past 3.)
You‚Äôre going to have to specify which one and source that for me please cause I legit don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about

40-48% owned by tencent though.

Aw man. Thats so sad, the man really was one of us.
I'd suggest that's pretty similar. Except you moved yourself to a new situation, and it was acknowledged.
Ya at Dell it's basically tech 1, tech 2, engineer 1, engineer 2, senior engineer, principal engineer, distinguished principal engineer etc but other than your roll naturally evolving and more responsibilities being tacked on you may well be at the same desk with the same manager
Smart money says invest in popcorn :)
Tencent has a major interest in Epic and they‚Äôve been floundering as a company with anti-consumer practices in the last couple of years.
Live sucks, there's a reason people weren't happy with it.
*mission failed we‚Äôll get them next time*
You really dont find any irony in them covering this up with some loose leaf paper and scotch tape?  I must be retarded because I find it absolutely ridiculous
It's money.

There's plenty of amazing staff at Blizzard. OVerwatch's team is amazing.
 Deflection. 

You said they were arrested, they weren't. State your case, or admit you're wrong.
Did you watch the stream? The commentators all but supported him, they knew exactly what he was going to say and let him. 

Exactly the same as if a western player had given a controversial statement and commentators had supported it.
>is not be surprised if the OW team had the most anger right now

i think you're agreeing with me. YOur sentence is just a bit awkward.

But yeah, i think Hearthstone would obviously have strong feelings. But overwatch has a very inclusive message. This goes very much against their themes.
~~Dicks~~ *kidneys* out for ~~Harambe~~ *China*
This is actually a thing in China

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_fee
Ah, misunderstood. Although, I really wouldn't be surprised to see them make similar concessions to China for the market they have out there. This is a much bigger issue than just Activision-Blizzard. All game companies in this country are getting in while the getting's good. If there's any kind of real coordinated effort to give Blizzard the middle finger here that gains traction, we will see them pay lip service and do damage control, but no one's passing laws to prevent this market from becoming the goal for these companies.
HQ is in Irvine, CA.
They have a campus there, I'm pretty sure it's just a call center... don't quote me on that. I can only speak to the HQ in Irvine.
Riot = League of Legends.

Epic = Fortnite

So, yes i think you're misunderstanding who Epic is.
I mean, he was a businessman, but his intentions were a hell of a lot more pure than J Allen Brack and crew now. I hate watching people shit on Morhaim and praise Hazzikostas. That man single handedly ruined BfA.
They're 40% shareholders IIRC. Major, but not controlling.
The story telling sucks for live. The gameplay of classic sucks. Both suck to a degree. Both have their positives. Both are grindy as fuck, though.
Too bad I can't just pull a Google and shadowban your comment to take all the credit
Good introspection!
>I must be retarded
hmm the chinese extradition law is kinda an arrest so i'm not wrong
I watched the clip, and to me they looked surprised. I don't think they knew.

&#x200B;

Do you have an example of this Western player getting banned for a controversial statement? Cause I'm failing to think of any.
I am indeed haha!
Wow.  That's balls-deep totalitarianism.
I don‚Äôt mind developer etc working for the companies. Business developers and marketing people that push for such decisions are vultures on the other hand. And that‚Äôs coming from a guy who has sold weapons and armored vehicles to countries
I am going to go deeper than you here. Riot is 100% owned by Tencent nowadays. 

Epic is 40-48% owned by Tencent nowadays. 

Im gonna go ahead and say that 40-48%, while not being a deciding share, is, arguably big enough that they are the same thing, especially when the 51% left belong to a single individual who can be coerced by force, threats and or money, which China has an abundance of all three.
He was, but he had a ton of genuine passion and love for the franchises and worlds under his wing. He treated us like customers, not dirt.

Ion is... fine. But nothing much more.
I got hyper
Classic gameplay is way better than live! Classes have more than 2 core moves :D
Now that would not be very cash money of you
wut.

Wrong country, and ridiculous logic.
I guess you didn't watch it...

They literally say "Alright, go on and say it (those words)" as he puts on his mask and they duck down.
> I am going to go deeper than you here. Riot is 100% owned by Tencent nowadays.


right, but you're the one that brought up Riot. 

>Epic is 40-48% owned by Tencent nowadays.

40%. Tencent bought 48% of *some amount* which equated to 40%. 

>Im gonna go ahead and say that 40-48%, while not being a deciding share, is, arguably big enough that they are the same thing

No, it's absolutely not when the other shareholder has 51%. Epic is not publicly traded. There's far less ways for Tencent to influence Epic. Epic is currently 100% controlled by Tim Sweeney. Your statement would be fair if no other stakeholder had over 50%. But that doesn't apply here. 

> coerced by force, threats and or money, which China has an abundance of all three.

If Tim Sweeney dies, it's not like his stocks go up for sale. And it'd be a huge story if Tencent were involved in the murder of Sweeney. The kind of shit that would have Tencent thrown out of the country. Money? Epic has plenty. And there are thousands of investors that'd line up to buy part of that fortnite and EGS bounty. 

Tencent absolutely have influence at the company. But they don't have absolute influence and Sweeney came out big with his statement. No way he'd back down.
Ion is just the lead for WoW, not CEO. And he's not fine, trust me. Every WoW team member prior to launch of BfA was trying to get this dude to be smarter on the systems they were creating for the xpac, he refused and didn't listen (hence why I said employees are pissed that they're not living up to "Every voice matters".) He is purely focused on Raid content even though their metrics show that raiders make up a significantly small portion of the game, and he let things like warfronts go by the wayside in terms of development all the way up to launch. He's not one of the good ones, dudes.
Ah, like rogues! That have sinister strike (or backstab if you're a dagger rogue) and eviscerate. Or mages! Who have either frostbolt or firebolt. Or Paladins that have... auto-attack.
The Googleyness would be off the charts tho
Sure, let's say they did know, I'll concede the point, because I think it's irrelevant. It's still a nuclear response to an issue where one side is clearly in the wrong. 

I notice you have not decided to give me an example of a western player getting banned for saying something controversial about western society. I take that to mean you do not have one. Your government (excuse the assumption, but I have serious doubts that anyone other than a citizen with 3 generations of indoctrination would stand up for such a dangerous dictatorship.) Routinely censors their own country, and now they are trying to impose those censor laws on the rest of the world. Going to jail and getting killed for speaking out against your government is, in the most basic sense, really fucking awful.

Free speech should be an unalienable right, and sure, there's consequences. Stupid is, as stupid does. But speaking out against corruption, should not warrant this kind of response.
I am sorry friend but the key I see from our discussion is the integrity of Tim Sweeney. 
Everything we mention here leads to the point that Wether he is influenced and obeys to China‚Äôs order depends on his integrity. 

Personally I do not give him the benefit of the doubt when it comes to that, but you are free to do so. 

It was an interesting discussion nonetheless and I thank you for it :)

Also FYI:

I know, I just said as much since you referenced him.

Like I said, I think he's fine. Not great for the game, kind of a twat, but at the end of the day that only brings me smoldering resentment. Im heavily invested in retail, or I at least used to be.
This is so triggering because I am at the verge of being a good WoW player (curved this season, got my fair share of rio score too) and the mixture of timegating and boredom is graspable in between; if you wanna focus on a raid that‚Äôs cool but then you only hand out loot once a week and titanforging is random? How am I supposed to enjoy the raid content somehow more than before if a) I can‚Äôt work towards a TF, it literally just happens whenever the game feels like it and b) I can‚Äôt run multiple groups or on more days because I only get loot once a week, so tomorrow it‚Äôs gonna be 8/8 and pray for loot, and then I am off to playing my alts and doing some azerite stuff again until an m+ group comes together because there is literally nothing more left to do.

It just goes to show how little that man understands about this game and what actual raid prep, world activities and other factors that just impacted your performance as a team member brought to the game and how they made me value raids much more in the past, specifically because it didn‚Äôt happen within the raid itself. A raid just has to mean something within the world it is set in and not just as this separate entity where the actual action is.
I find that very hard to believe when no one is more frustrated with the game than high end raiders.
Theres a lot more than Ion at fault.  Everyone has their flaws, but it has to be heavily driven from further afield. Ion was once the GM of a very famous, pioneering raid guild in wows earlier days.
Fire ball! + All the side-spells unpruned, and stuff like trash buff stacking a thing. PvP way more skillful and burstier :D
Guys its ok we took out the do no evil part from our rules now we can do anything hahahahaha^hahaha *ha ha ha*
>Sure, let's say they did know

They did, it's perfectly clear if you actually watch the clip and speak the language. 

>I notice you have not decided to give me an example of a western player getting banned for saying something controversial about western society.

Svenskeran from LoL is a famous example from a few years back. 

But lemme give you a hypothetical: Say an Overwatch League player in an interview said he hated that Soldier 76 had been revealed as gay, and thought that was disgusting, or any other similar sentiment. 

How do you think that'd be received?

Would you be threatening to cancel your account in response to his punishment?

Or would you be commenting "Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences!"?

Funny how this only works one way, huh?

>Your government (excuse the assumption, but I have serious doubts that anyone other than a citizen with 3 generations of indoctrination would stand up for such a dangerous dictatorship.) 

Pathetic. 

I'm in favor of the HK movement. That doesn't mean I can't call out your blatant hypocrisy. 

>Going to jail and getting killed for speaking out against your government is, in the most basic sense, really fucking awful.

How's Manning doing lately? What about Snowden? Oh hey, what about the guy who founded Reddit? Hmm.

>Free speech should be an unalienable right, and sure, there's consequences. Stupid is, as stupid does. But speaking out against corruption, should not warrant this kind of response.

Weasel words. You admit I'm right with one breath, then try excuse it with the next.
I mean from what I've heard he's a nice dude. Eccentric but nice. Living near RAleigh he's just about the only legit famous/powerful person i've got near connections to (people that know him). Obviously meeting a guy at a party or knowing his wife isn't exactly representative of him. 

But in his support he is the only major game/esports head that has come out  in support of free speech when it comes to his fortnite game. 

Also, unrelated to videogames he bought a huge amount of lands for preservation. And donated millions to conservation in my and state area.

Also, until Fortnite, Epic/unreal games has been a huge positive to the gaming industry and widely considered one of the most ethical.
Gotcha, thought you were comparing them as a similar position. I certainly don't think he's fine, either way. Bad ideas and bad efforts at coordination with his team.
https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/dfh4lk/discussion_this_subreddit_put_out_several_warning/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

He does sound like a cool guy but that doesn‚Äôt mean he doesn‚Äôt have only HIS best interest at hand.
That adds nothing though. 

Having a large % of a publicly traded company is a big deal. Having a large % of a private company means nothing.

Also, just becuase Tencent has 2 board seats means nothing. 2 out of 5 = 40%. Obviously Epic listens to Tencent. You always listen to your investors. But that doesn't mean Tencent have control. Sure in some company the board of directors are all powerful. but sometimes they just aren't.
Actually I was more referencing the point that are made under, regarding the documents stating the power of veto or requiring the presence of a specific member of the board before doing something.

Just canceled my subscription.
Cancelled my wow subscription, which sucks cause I was excited for the new patch.
Done, thank you!  

I've played blizzard games since Warcraft 2/StarCraft and would like to thank blizzard for the fun times I've had. But - and this comes from the bottom of my heart - fuck you and fuck what you've become. That's all.
Did so myself!
Don't delete your account.  Instead, overwhelm them with GDPR requests.
[I've spent hundreds of dollars over my 15+ years interacting with Blizzard, but you'll never get another nickel of my money or another second of me engaging with your products.](https://imgur.com/a/k45ZPzK)

Liberate Hong Kong, and fuck your disgusting company for putting financial gain over the freedom of millions.
So my wife asked me to \*not\* deactivate my account, as i originally intended, because she thinks we'll probably get the chance to play some games, from there, together, in the future (we play D3, SC:BW and SC2 together). BUT, since this cannot be left as it is, we both uninstalled all Blizzard games, together with the Blizzard app. Also, a good friend of mine, who  has invested \*a lot\* of money into Hearthstone, did the same (and also promised me to never invest a dime into their games, for as long as he lives). It hurt all of us to depart from these games but human rights outweigh any fucking game on this planet.
Just deleted overwatch! Go to China where you belong!
I was loving the solo adventures. Was just about to purchase the last wing to play tonight, deleted the app instead. EVERY VOICE MATTERS? Shame on you blizzard. Shame
Is there any way to do this without having to give them a copy of my photo ID?
[removed]
Same, fuck em
Thank you for this! Will not be renewing my wow sub.

Huh, rather curious timing.
Canceled my sub!
I'm actually doing this. Thank you for the link friend. Fuck this company.
Done, canceled. Sad to see it go I really enjoyed HS and WoW but I cannot support this
Cancelled my wow sub but will not let me remove my account and data.  
I've tried e-mail code, sms code and secret question. All answered correctly and got a denied too many attempts message everytime.  
Very fishy, anyone else having this issue?
There‚Äôs a reason there are rules. You guys deleting your accounts/unsubbing are ridiculous and a tiny minority. As much as I support Hong Kong protests, THERE IS A STRICT RULE DISALLOWING INVOLVEMENT WITH SUCH THINGS FOR TOURNAMENT PLAYERS. I‚Äôm sorry you all think this rule shouldn‚Äôt apply to someone, but get the hell over yourself and grow the hell up. 

If you want things to change, try and change them. Don‚Äôt break the rule then expect change after. Just because it could change in the future, doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt apply now. As of right this very second, he has broken tournament rules. It might be a stupid rule, but it‚Äôs one and he couldn‚Äôt follow it. He doesn‚Äôt deserve to be in the tournament. Maybe next time he‚Äôll grow up along with the rest of Reddit (lol never happening).
Delete it outright don‚Äôt be one of those guys doing it for attention and not deleting the account and characters
I'm out of the loop, what has blizzard done this time?

Not sure why I got downvoted for asking what happened, it's not like this is the first time blizzard has pissed people off.
Deleted account!!
FYI, the blizzard SMS protect method of verification no longer works even if you put in the correct code and locks you out for "too many attempts" after the first one.

EDIT: and even if you do [you get this](https://i.imgur.com/761ljiP.png). I still got an email saying they recieved the request, so I am gonna assume it worked and check again in a week.
Figured you could just talk about Winnie the Pooh and Tiananmen Square, and it would go away overnight.
This level of irony would be funny if it was a skit, not so much irl
Done
I am trying to delete my account but the b@stards won't let me! I tried the code authenticator but they're telling me "Due to too many attempts, Authenticator Code has been locked. Please try another method for verification." instead they want my Photo ID?! ARE THEY NUTS?!!!!
done!
Can't do it, it just tells me I have done "too many attempts" on both SMS and authenticator even though this is the first time today I am using either to login. The third option is to give a government issued photo ID but I didn't even give them my real name so I am 100% sure they are just going to say it's not me or some bullshit. Fuck Blizzard.

&#x200B;

edit: Can't even send a ticket because I need authentication for that so seriously, fuck Blizzard.
About to cancel my WoW sub. Sucks because I was really getting back into it
[deleted]
This should be stickied.
I cant even message them on Facebook. Auto banned
I'm trying to delete but 2FA don't let me. I got `Due to too many attempts, SMS Protect Code has been locked. Please try another method for verification.`on the first try and all following one. Guess I will have to send a photo.
Now, I'm not deleting Blizzard because I love overwatch, but I sure as hell not buying anything from them again,
Just canceled my wow subscription
Done. Just disappointed they did not ask for a reason anywhere in the form.
isn't even working. "too many attempts"-related message on the first attempt, for each confirmation method. definitely not sending a picture of my id.
Well, guess I finally have time to read the Silmarillion (I probably spelled it wrong)
Blizzard better start sucking chinas dick even harder because im done.

DONE.

Launcher uninstalled, wow sub canceled.

I hope the china money was worth it.

Its needs to be now.
Time for us to put our money where our mouths are.

https://imgur.com/wth1QIv
Thank you cancelled mine
Cancelled my account.
Doing this tonight. Fuck you Blizzard.
Account deletion pending after 15 years of playing. Fuck blizzard.
The two existing options don't seem to work at all.
OP, post this on /r/YouShouldKnow
Thanks!
Interesting. While its nice to have a way to completely scrub an account, that seems like an obvious way for a malicious hacker to fuck with someone whose account they've hacked by scrubbing the account without any way to ever recover it. Since all it takes is logging into the account, going to that page, and clicking 3 buttons.
I'm gonna go and give away all my gold to my friends / guildies / random newbies in Classic first and help my guild out till my sub runs out. Then doing this.
This *really* hurt to do. So many games I love. But if they won‚Äôt take a stand for *this* then they don‚Äôt stand for anything. I guess I have to.
I didnt have a current sub but uninstalled everything even the Bnet launcher and will be deleting my account as soon as it lets me. I think they have it shut off currently as it told me i couldn't use my authenticator or sms protect as verification methods.

I am a OG Blizzard fan. All the way back to Warcraft 1/2. Always looked forward to Blizzcon announcements and how Blizzard was going to revolutionize gaming. Blizzards decline for the last 12 years has been real but i could put up with it now and again. This move putting China above all else is the straw that breaks the camels back for me completely. Never again shall i give Blizzard or Activision any money. My fears of Bobby "greedy dickhead" Kotick killing Blizzard has finally happened. I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner to be honest.

The funny part is if Blizzard had done nothing at all and just let the kids have his five minutes of fame people would have given Blizzard cheers instead of all the hate they are now getting.
My subscription is about to expire. I'ma just let it.
Deleted my account. Pity, I'd been playing a lot of OW recently, but fuck these guys.
Thanks, I haven't touched any blizz games in awhile, got bored of Overwatch and HOTS is dead from the region I'm in. Might as well delete my account anyway
Done!
This should be stickied.
Deleted my account.
Blizzard. Uninstalled.
I had considered deleting my account, but I really want a complete a refund of all my purchases whichis unlikely.  I will continue to not play their games though.
They gone!  Appeasing fucks.  Been playing Blizzard games since Warcraft 2, 20+ years.  Never again

I haven't spent a ton of time or money on Blizzard games like some of y'all, mostly just some Hearthstone a while ago. But I always figured I'd come back to Hearthstone eventually, or try out WoW or something else they have on offer. Not now; I'll continue spending my time and money elsewhere, and deleting my account helps ensure that.
Put your wallet where your mouth is at and Cancel your blizz con ticket. 

And if they won‚Äôt refund contact your credit company and tell them for ‚Äúunforeseen circumstances you need to cancel it‚Äù and make the credit card company flood them with request. 

Your life will move on with no blizzcon for a year
Canceled my wow subscription too. It's the right thing to do, besides gives me a chance to go through my backlog.
"Due to too many attempts, SMS Protect Code has been locked. Please try another method for verification." I keep getting this message even thought I tried it twice.
They are making you submit photo I'd to cancel now.

They used to let you do a text verification, but now they are putting up roadblocks.

Fuck blizzard.
Canceled wow sub and refunded wc3 preorder.
I've kept my WoW sub active for almost 12 years now. Unfortunately it has come to an end. It hurts but i cant support a company that supports chinese censorship.
Blizzard want me to provide photo id to cancel my account, nice try China!
When we delete our blizzard account, we transform from "one who has no life" to "one who has life IRL"
Deleting mine tonight. I was already sick of Overwatch with the godawful role queue but this seals the deal. No love for a commie loving company. Get fucked and enjoy that Chinese money you fucks. 

People: Go play DOTA 2, Destiny 2, Risk of rain 2. 

MANY other great games.
canceled
No way in fuck am I sending them my government ID to disable my account. I'll go through whatever legal channel I have to.

I submitted a picture of me logged in. If this is enough info to protect my games, it should be enough info to remove my account.

Games are not so serious to need the same level of authentication as a passport.
Thank you! Fuck off blizzard
Yeah, Canceled Sub and Deleted all games. DON'T FORGET TO CANCEL IF YOU PREORDERED Warcraft Remastered!!!!
Give them a photo id? No way. 

I'll just smash my authenticator with a hammer and call it good.
I just canceled my WoW subscription. It's a bummer, since I still enjoy the game. Oh well, hopefully Blizzard gets the message.
It asked for a picture of a photo ID, so I blacked out every piece of information except the stuff they already have (name, DOB, billing address). [Hopefully that'll work](https://imgur.com/adz9ZoK), I'll update if it does.

EDIT: [Denied!](https://imgur.com/smj1Usy) They want an unedited photo. Maybe they didn't like how I included "Liberate Honk Kong, revolution of our age" on the photo. Whoops. üñï

EDIT #2: Uploading an unedited ID photo [seems to have worked](https://imgur.com/Tb4pDyt). Sucks that they needed to see my face, driver's licence class, and eye color to verify my account, even though that information has nothing to do with my Blizzard account, but whatever.
[deleted]
Could one, hypothetically, turn this link into a QR code to print onto signs or a shirt to wear to Blizzcon?
Asking for a government id to delete an account? GTFO.. I'm going to hand over my ID to a company shown to bow to China? Yeah... right.
Done and done, thank you champ.
Overwatch is my release after a long day at work.. And I am quite confident that no one is a better Hanzo than me.  

But I hate China with a passion and really want to help the Tibetans, Uighurs, and Hong Kongers.  This is so painful.
Deleted my account. Been on bnet since Diablo 2. You'll never see another dime, Blizzard.
Cancelled my WoW subscription and did a total recall on my credit card where I bought packs with a buddy a few days ago. Left them "Go fuck yourself." as a reason, I think they know why.
There goes what was in my youth the greatest game company...  They went from supporting small communities to licking Chinese boots and suppressing free speech.

Deleted my account, and am urging all friends to do the same.
All I see are a bunch of idiots thinking it would make a difference why would china even give a damn if blizzard supported them you guys have fun not playing wow while I have fun doing the opposite
I‚Äôm not ready to part yet. I‚Äôd be bawling if I said goodbye now... point is, for anyone like me we can still unsubscribe and will keep the memories of a better time under a better company in mind :/
Pretty sketchy that despite having the authenticator option or sms text option for verification they immediately fail those attempts and force you to upload your ID.
I did it earlier today but they rejected my request. They wanted photo ID as proof of who I was. I sent them a photo of my drivers license but I blacked out my license ID number (I don‚Äôt trust them with that info). They said...

> The identification document you submitted along with the request was illegible

Which is BS. Anyone else have any advice?
Not sure how long it took you all, but I'm currently waiting on a reply to my request/ticket. Here's hoping that means there are significant amounts of deactivation going on.
INVOKE ARTICLE 2659
What's funny is the Chinese stole mine years ago.
From the lost vikings onwards, I've liked blizard, the ups and down, the hits and misses. No more. Account deleted. this company is dead to me now.
I'm all cancelled up. Was really enjoying classic too...
Cancelled my subscription I have had since TBC.
I just got stuck deleting my account.  It sent me the same SMS verification code 3x in a row, each time saying that the code is no longer valid (probably being hugged to death by account deletions I hope) and the only alternative is for me to send a picture of my photo ID, Oh hell No.  Sent them a Xi/Pooh pic instead, so we'll see how this goes.  My ticket is submitted at least.
I‚Äôm glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family‚Äôs organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
Can't cancel, all options saying "tried too many times" when I only did each once. Have they canceled the cancel?
Thank you! I have a FEW accounts to delete from my WoW days.
Updated: 13 Hours ago.

Hmm
Cancelled WoW suscription!
Cancelled my subs. Left a scathing comment, probably won't be read.
This is painful. Wow classic helped bring me out of a dark place and now it's ruined :(
blizzard is stopping me from deleting my account with them, claiming i made too many attempts even though it was my first attempt.
I was about to buy a subscription for wow classic. Not anymore. Good timing I guess?
Done
[These cobbas made me upload government issued ID for this shit, smh.](https://imgur.com/a/G7senRL) Shame to think I paid 80 odd dollars for Overwatch to see this happen.
But can I still play on /r/slashdiablo since I‚Äôm using a pirated version on private servers? I‚Äôm gonna delete my wow account. Anyone want a free 100G?
The first Blizzard game I played was the original Warcraft many years ago on a 486. I‚Äôve been along for the ride and bought every single game since up until Overwatch. 

I logged countless hours in WoW, Diablo 3, and who knows how many over all their games. I figure probably around 1000 or so in Starcraft back in the 90‚Äôs. I go way back and have given them a lot of money over the decades. 

Not anymore, I requested the anonymization of my account and gladly forfeit my purchase history as I‚Äôm completely done. 

Blizzard acquiescing to a nation that commits some of the most heinous human rights violations of our time is something I have to acknowledge by severing all ties. There‚Äôs lots of great memories playing with friends and family ingame on Blizzard games over the years, and it‚Äôs sad to watch their corporate governance place their business concerns in this way so as to violate my own core tenets and values to such a degree. 

This isn‚Äôt exaggeration, this is all the raw truth of it. Blizzard has appeased a truly terrible regime and it‚Äôs giving me great pause to consider more intently as to everything I buy and where it comes from. If it says ‚Äúmade in China‚Äù I will just have to find a way to live without it, whatever it is from iPhones, tv‚Äôs, toasters, to clothing or even software. 

Tencent and NetEase investments into my favorite studios and companies will probably kill my passion for gaming entirely. 

This whole thing just sucks.
Guys, stop overloading the system, its taken over 20min so far for them to send me a email verification code so I can delete my account.
Done!
Glad this finally stayed up.
Email sent. 15 years of playing WoW. Bye  


Now to sell all my Blizzard crap to some commie sympathizer.
Thank you. Deleted it.
Just tried this got denied on all three options.
Yup, been playing hearthstone for a while and although it sucks to lose 5 years of progress, I don't want anything to do with Blizzard and will find a new card game for 2020 and beyond. Just submitted my support ticket to delete my account.
I am having my lawyer draft a letter demanding closure of account AND deletion of ALL my data, citing local state law that overrides their ToS and privacy policy on what they may keep! :) feel this will be a better message than just a support ticker closure!
I haven't played in years, but I was debating starting up again to play wow classic with my daughter.  Thank you Blizzard!
Sold my stocks and unsubscribed.
Question: Already transferred my Destiny 2 account, am I free to delete now?
Fuck blizzard.
I don't have my real name or information linked to my blizzard account and now i'm lost as to how I can delete it.
Yea that'll show em lol
Give me your account.
Thank you for this.

I waited for years for Classic Wow to return. I was having such a blast playing it, making new friends, and re-experiencing old memories.

Like I said in the Classic Wow sub, it is insane to me that a games company with stories about standing up against evil and fighting for justice would so easily bend the knee to an evil murderous tyrannical regime. 

There is another theme within Blizzard games though: redemption. While Blizzard is like this now, perhaps they will correct their ways. I have cancelled my WoW sub, unisnstalled HotS and Hearthstone and remove the launcher, but perhaps, just perhaps, one day they will become an ethical company again. I will hold onto hope and my account until then.
https://imgur.com/a/PJ8TcPL

This is what's happening right now when trying to deactivate.

It asks for a code sent via SMS.  Entered code once, correctly.  This is the first error.  Retrying several times gives the same SMS code over and over, with the same error every time.

Trying to get around it by submitting a support ticket takes you in a circle back to the start, asking for SMS validation, which doesn't work.

Seems like the only chance to delete is by sending photo ID, which I've never given to Blizzard before and don't really want to.  Especially now?

Convenient time for things to stop working.  Seems like they're making it as hard as they can for you to drop them in hopes you'll forget about it.
Aaaaaaand canceled.

I was enjoying classic. It's a shame.
Cancelling tonight. I've actually been loving Classic, so this hurts. But it's at least something I can do.
I don‚Äôt have an account with Blizzard nor do I play their games but I am reading through the amount of people who are deactivating their accounts and I just want to say how proud I am of everyone and how much this huge amount of support for Hong Kong. It is heart warming.
I made an account just so I can cancel it. Take that Blizzard!
Cancelled my sub as well
so is everyone going to take it all the way then? cancel Google, Apple, and stay away from Microsoft products? in many ways they do far worse than blizzard by giving China the tools to censor and control.
Subscription canceled
Deleted my account. Never giving them a cent, ever again.
Deleted my account! Proud to disassociate myself with a company that censors free speech!
Attempted to delete my account. On the first attempt, both by Authenticator and by SMS, I was told:

>Due to too many attempts, Authenticator/SMS Code has been locked. Please try another method for verification.
I also cancelled my wow subscription and left a very angry reason why I am unsubscribing.
SMS and authenticator verification are currently disabled for deleting your account. You have to submit a photo ID. Talked to someone in support and they sounded like they were having a very bad day.

If you do call, don't take it out on the support team. They're just as demoralized as anyone else. It's not their fault.
I tried to delete my account (only use it for Diablo3) and they won't let me authenticate with SMS after 2 uses. So I changed all the information I could to Free Hong Kong. I never had any active subscriptions with them, and I certain am not going to start now.


I cannot wait for a verified blizzard employee posts on reddit to explain their position and it gets down voted more than that one EA post.
WHAT THE SHIT IS THIS?

I HAVE TO SEND THEM A COPY OF MY GOVERNMENT ID TO GET THEM TO DELETE MY ACCOUNT???

I AM NOT GIVING YOU ANYMORE FUCKING INFORMATION BLIZZARD, GET SUED!!!!

Just deleted my account
Ok so I tried this, and the only way they could "verify" that I actually want to delete the account is by giving them my government issued ID.  
Problem is: I've never given them that before. And I'm sure as hell not gonna now.   
Is anyone else having this issue?
Canceling wow, never buying another blizzard game again.
play on private server, BC and WOTLK are better anyway and you won't be giving moneys to china
just so you all know, some hundreds of you not giving them money anymore won't cancel out the millions of chinese people that constantly give them money

it's like ur surprised a video game giant caters to the most profitable country in the world and that you expect them not to
Wish i could sign up just to delete it
Wtf? They want my government id to delete the account?? FUCK THAT.
Blizzard is not letting me delete my account. It says "Due to too many attempts, Email Code has been locked" so I can't verify my ticket despite it was my first attempt. I made sure it was not my adblock, firewall or antivirus. Seems like too many epic gamers are deleting their accounts at the same time, more like "Due to popular demand, Blizzard is now trying to cut loss" and I ain't gonna give them my damn ID for verification. 

Screen capture for those who are interested: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RiO1VV88Bh-IIYJs5uj0WdSjOT\_k-Uxs/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RiO1VV88Bh-IIYJs5uj0WdSjOT_k-Uxs/view?usp=sharing)
So are people really deleting their accounts?
awesome

I'd love to see analytics on how many are doing this. I jumped on SC II and everygame started "GLHF" then "LIBERATE HONG KONG"
only game I play from them is overwatch. deleting my account wont send a message because they already got my money. I have been tired of the game tho...so ill throw matches instead.
why is it asking for a photo of my id?
Site won't let me delete my data. Requires a photo id (which is shady as hell in this situation) but the choose image file button doesn't do anything.
I will never be purchasing another blizzard game.
I never played any blizzard game. But I fuckin commend all of you for canceling and sticking it to Blizzard. FUCK this, that, AND China! Anyway I can help lmk.
At first I was like: "haha, funny joke, many people wont actually delete their account".

But then I started thinking... what if I delete mine? For several years I have almost felt like my own nostalgia prisoner, where occasionally I boot up WoW/Diablo 3, play a while and then play other games. Especially WoW.

I'm not actually getting that much of enjoyment from *playing* the game, but I really really enjoy what artist have done with it - music, asthetics, lore (some parts of it).

If I delete my account I won't actually be losing anything major, just a lot of cosmetic rewards and some mounts. But they don't really have value, they are just collectibles.

If I delete my account I will actually be free of this Blizzard's hold over my nostalgia, which is actually never coming back, only constantly trying to relive the "good old days" without actually doing it.
Posting my deletion notice to this sub now.
Done
How to delete chinese account
Just cancelled my 500+ hr WOW account. No regrets! Goodbye jerks!
Many years of World of Warcraft Subscriptions, a retail purchase of every single game and expansion they have ever released, three in the case of Starcraft and Brood War, two in the case of Warcraft III, and of course many in-game purchases in World of Warcraft and Hearthstone.

This is the kind of customer Blizzard has lost today, and I really hope some high profile streamers will do the right thing and many more follow. This needs to impact their bottom line irreparably.

"Hitler was an amazing man taken before his time and we hope someone continues his great work." -Blizzard if they were around at the time.

Fuck this company.

ÂÖâÂæ©È¶ôÊ∏Ø ÊôÇ‰ª£Èù©ÂëΩ
3 hours ago they updated it so now you have to issue a request AND possibly send a government issued photo ID, jesus blizzard
Is anyone else getting a "Denied" message when trying to delete now? I was busy today and just had time now.
Deleted all the games, will remove launcher too:  [https://i.imgur.com/4D0DFzA.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/4D0DFzA.gifv)
thanks, did this
just cancelled my subscription
I have just had my account for 1 month, started with wow classic. But I did what I could and removed my account. Fuck Blizzard
I've been playing wow for 9 years, I'm cancelling my subscription and deleting my accounts. Will never give blizzard another cent.
If you are boycotting Blizzard boycott Activision aswell. They are the same company.
Done. With Destiny 2 already having moved to Steam, giving up the other games was an easier choice.
Deleted whole Activision account. Fuck em
Last night my ONLY option to delete my account was to ..SuBmIt GoVerNmEnT IsSuED ID toVerIfY My IDenTiTY...so i started openeing a bunch of tickets with gay porn with Kotick and Winnie Poh faces on the..protagonists and at some point the email option popped up on the site..soo there you go, if you cant see the option to delete your account WITHOUT UPLOADING YOUR FRICKEN ID..just spam them with gay porn  :D
I might not be a big number in the bigger Scale of things since i only play overwatch but im unistalling battlenet. After a year of playing ow daily. This ends now. That was wrong of Blizzard. I was gonna buy the virtual ticket but no. They had to do it. You aint gonna get my 40‚Ç¨.
I've really enjoyed playing classic so far but having games companies kowtow to authoritarian regimes is where I step way out.
"You may be required to submit a government issue photo ID."
Thanks. Currently waiting if I can get a refund for a game.   
Favourited for after the confirmation of the support.   


I started WoW early before Burning Crusade and I used to love Blizz and their games. Even to  the point beyond reason. But enough is enough.
Done! >:-(
Thank you. Glad to see so many proud Americans :)
Thank you for this!
ok you guys all delete your accounts i'll stay behind and fight them from the inside
As stupid as this whole situation is on blizzard side, it‚Äôs sad when you realise every single company would have probably done the same thing.
Is anyone else getting a message that says, "Due to too many attempts, SMS Protect Code[or any other form of verification] has been locked. Please try another method for verification." I tried all four methods of verification and get the same message.
Was just about to sign up for a WoW classic account then heard about this whole situation. Yea I think Jagex is keeping my money
FUCK BLIZZARD
[fuck blizzard, I'm gone] (http://imgur.com/gallery/rRaeuNg)
[Submitted. Fuck Blizzard, freedom for others over entertainment.](https://i.imgur.com/WEcc3bc.jpg)
I love how they ask to attach a photo ID when you want to delete it.

"Hey I want to delete my personal info"

"Sure, send us your personal info"

And it's the only way to prove you're the accounts owner.

Welp, just left my name and surname unblurred, they can choke on them.

EDIT: To be honest, feels kind of sad after hours and hours in WoW, preordered Warcraft 3, D3, Starcraft.. On the other hand, makes me kind of happy.
Just uninstalled all Blizzard related games until further notice of a reversal of this disgust.
FUCK FINEEE

RIP 5000 armor druid....

**clicks uninstall**
While attempting to delete my account I was somehow DENIED when I tried Authenticator App authentication, SMS authentication, Email authentication and Secret Question authentication.  SMH.

So I had to submit a picture of my ID.
I 'lose connection' immediately after submitting a picture of my ID. But I'll keep trying. üëçFuck Blizzardüëç
Done, thanks. Not played recently but did a few years ago and would have come back for interesting expansions/games. But not anymore, completely boycotting these guys.

Shame on Blizzard.
Aight ima head out
I‚Äôm trying to delete my account but when they want to verify my identity by sending an email code they keep denying it, what the hell is going on?!!!
Glad D2 got the hell out of there so I can keep supporting them (for now).  
I've been playing blizzard games for YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEARS on multiple systems through multiple expansions and more.   
And I'm done.  
I'm not supporting a company that is against the very people who made them what they are.  
Companies like Blizzard and Epic are so full of themselves that they don't feel any pressure when their community disagree's with what they do. Well, you just lost a ton of customers who've been with you for varying amounts of time, and I am now one of them.   
No wonder Bungie was popping champagn when they got away from you people.  
(Side note, I've never been apart of the blizzard reddit until I heard about this, read through everything, and just wanted to add to the list of people leaving.)  
The last few years have been a complete DUMPSTER FIRE for you guys, and you just keep adding to it.  
It's like someone inside the company wants you to fail.
I've bought and played every single Blizzard game since the original Diablo.  Blizzard always had a special place in my heart, and I've made countless friends during those times.  When I go home tonight, I'll be logging in this one last time to bid farewell to my friends and then to uninstall everything.  Goodbye Blizzard, I wish you hadn't become what you are.
I see some people posting about Blizzard refusing to delete their account, and the steps they can take to force the company to comply with deletion requests if they live in the EU. I live in Canada and have requested that my account be permanently deleted. What options do I have if they refuse to do so?
Seems right  so I deleted my sister account
I had literally been wanting to experience classic for 15 years. I almost had my first character to 60. Though now I must end my sub. Really sad about this one.
Thank you OP!
Tried to delete my account. Uploaded ID. Got email saying "We have received your *data protection request*." Is that the same as closing the account? They seem to be making it as awkward as possible.
Why do I need a photo ID? I'm not comfortable giving them a copy of my South African ID.
I took Overwatch off of my PS4. Was also planning to get it for Switch, which isn‚Äôt gonna happen now.
Doing it this evening after i come home from work. No more money for you Bobby.
Thanks, friend. They required a photo ID for my cancelation so I took liberty to write something that china wouldn't enjoy.
I have to upload a picture of my government issued ID to delete my account!!??

[What in the fuck?](https://i.imgur.com/Cd78Wsb.png)
Done.
[It is done.](https://i.redd.it/f66yac1tohr31.png)

Thousands of hours in WoW.

Hundreds of hours in HotS and Overwatch.

No regrets.
The site says to upload a picture of your government issued ID to go through with the request. 

DON'T DO THIS!

They don't need to know what you look like to know you're you. Black out ALL information that they don't already have. Including your face.
Now I just have to wait for the confirmation. Then I can happily destroy this authenticator

Thanks for this
https://i.imgur.com/a0sp2fm.png

it's been a blast
I cant delete my account wihtout uploading a photo of my ID, not gonna happen. 

&#x200B;

Literally r/assholedesign
Thank you for this. Deleted. Will not be coming back.
Overwatch stopped being fun about 2 months in, HS has been pay to win shit since the beginning. HOTS tried, is all I can say. Diablo's future is in mobile. Starcraft..huh..

And lastly, WoW in 2019 LOL
Blizzard asks for a photo of my ID to delete my account, not gonna give them my ID though. Any other way?
Currently waiting in the support chat
Yea I'm not deleting my account. I only play OW on occasion, but, yea.
You guys are all making me so proud. I kind of want to cry. I don‚Äôt have anything to do with Hong Kong or Blizzards games but this kind of community togetherness is so incredible.
I loved wow classic, but I love democracy and basic human rights more. Sorry Blizzard, but I guess the yuan beats out the dollar since you'll get no more of my money until your values align with mine again.
Aww man, I was really looking forward to WCIII Reforged. Damn shame.
I think only 1% of the players have the balls to actually delete their accounts. I don‚Äôt fucking care about Blizzard‚Äôs opinion on political matters. I just wanna play my games.
You all need to get rid of your apple phones too and stop watching the NBA and probably toss out a buncha other shit you have related to China.
Hit them where it hurts folks. If you pre-ordered modern warfare, cancel that shit. Don‚Äôt let Blizzard/Activision get away with this absolutely garbage behavior.
Jesus
Need help,mine keeps getting denied. i tried sms and authenticator but still denied?
So glad destiny moved to steam last week
As some else mentioned request all your data first. At least in EU we can request via GDPR and make tons of work for them. If they can't supply in time (1 month) they may get fined.
This controversy has got me so angry I'm going to quit HotS a month ago (HotS is the only Blizzard game I still played up till moving to new country. Good fucking riddance.)
Damn, I've consistently enjoyed daily games of Overwatch for a year or two and feel like I could go for several more years.  But haha fuck Blizzard, I dont need overwatch that bad
Been a few decades and some good times but Blizzard and I are done.
Done :)
my brother had finally convinced me to try wow classic

then this shit happened, and he's convinced me to NOT try wow classic

I mean I didn't need his convincing, but damn
If I try to delete my account they keep sending me the same invalid confirmation number via SMS wtf
Yay :D
It hurt. Canceled the wow subscription, deleted hots and hearthstone, diablo and sc. Some of my favorite games of all time were made by Blizzard. But I cannot support a company that so blatantly gives the middle finger to people fighting and dying for freedom. Fuck Blizzard and Fuck China
Requires photo id?!?
Deleted my account.  Never going back to WoW again.  I was looking forward to Diablo 4 if that ever was going to happen.  Not anymore, never again
Just deleted my WoW account.
> Due to too many attempts, SMS Protect Code has been locked. Please try another method for verification. 

This is the "error" that I get no matter what method of authentication I try. I received this from my my very first try using the authenticator method. Looks like the only way that might work is submitting a photo ID as a ticket...

Kind of counter productive when the goal is to have them erase all of your personal information and there is absolutely no reason ALL of the default verification methods are magically not working.

Appears to be a clear attempt at stifling the deluge of people wanting to support free speech and democracy. Essentially there doubling down on there support of China with this move.
I also cancelled my wow sub and made sure they knew why I did it. Freedom is more important than me playing a game lol.
Trying to delete, getting an error with text validation... Anyone else?
Well I did it. Goodbye blizzard, I can safely say now that I won't be missing you. Ahhhh steam my old friend... It's been way too long.
Is anyone else getting a "too many attempts please come back later" error message when verifying your identity to delete your account?
It seems they are forcing for a ID now, cause i can't use authenticator to start the ticket.
Sadly I dont have a vehicle in this fight, I quit blizzard at d3 launch. Stick it to them guys.

Bye bye actiblizz! can I also get a chargeback on 10 years worth of hobby time I spent? No? Oh well.
[deleted]
I‚Äôve spent hundreds on Overwatch because I thought that Blizzard was an organization that I could stand beside. They seemed like they really stood by the community as well. But I have come to realize that they are just as greedy and shallow as any other corporation and am deleting my account. I‚Äôll never spend another dollar on any of their games until they change their priorities.
Done here as well!
So I‚Äôm trying to delete my account but it‚Äôs asking me to verify with my ID. Anyone else have to do this? Just seems a bit strange they are requesting a picture of my ID to delete it. Maybe I‚Äôm doing it wrong not sure, but I‚Äôm certainly not going to show my ID. Any help? Deleting account via phone btw.
I grew up with Blizzard. My gaming life started with Lost vikings Diablo and Warcraft Orcs and Humans as a kid. Too see Blizzard "with" western ideals of freedom of speech go down the road holding hands with a dictatorship that is trying to censor the world, it's heartbreking.

I have now canceled my subscriptions and won't speak a good word about Blizzard untill they change their ways.
I quit playing blizzard games almost 1 year ago due to BFA/Blizzcon being garbage. Im glad to see I made the right choice. Their actions are unforgivable.
Thanks, hate to do this but I‚Äôll going to today
Anyone else having an issue of not being able to delete? The security code I'm receiving through email is being immediately denied.
Don't have a subscription but I bought at least 1000$ of hearthstone cards. Closing my account to send a message that I won't be buying anything anymore.
Full delete request sent.

Byebye sc2, diablo3 and overwatch.
Not prepared to submit my ID to finalize the account closure. Hoping a picture of Xi Jinping will do the job.

I wonder if there's a limit on how many times I can submit a deletion request in this manner.
We should take China government out back and put em down
Glad that I wasn't over reacting when I cancelled my subscription and deleted all the Blizzard stuff on my computer.
Won't let me verify my account. Tried SMS protect code once, "Due to too many attempts, Authenticator Code has been locked. Please try another method for verification." Tried authenticator code, "Due to too many attempts, Authenticator Code has been locked. Please try another method for verification."
blizzard rn be like "we'll win them back with a titty streamer on twitch poaching our next big thing" or just give a freebie month or something else and you'll all go crawling back. games weren't even good to begin with, blizzcon will still sell out and you'll all eat the poopoo
They denied both of my authenticators even though they were exactly right. Wtf blizzard
When you're uninstalling their phone apps, remember to give 1/5 stars while at it.
Unsubbed
#If you or anyone your know plans on deleting their account, don't just delete your account! You can request your Data from Blizzard and if they dont follow trhough within 30 days they have to pay hefty fines inside the EU. If everyone does this, they might have such an enormous backlog and will have to pay up. More details here: https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfcncg/dont_just_delete_your_account_you_can_request/
Done. I haven't played WoW in a while, don't care for Overwatch anymore and never got into other Blizz games. There goes Chavelo and Alita into the nether, my Beastmaster Hunter and his spirit kitty.

They would agree that this is pretty fucking shitty to do in part of Blizzard.
Done. Thanks for the link.
Lots of people leaving emans less likely I will be ganked in STV. Can't say I will mind.
Just tried to delete my account and got a "too many failed attempts" on both sms and email verification codes. Attempted once only on each method. Shady af. I am not giving them personal info, but I did delete all the games and the battlenet app.
Show your support for the freedom of China
I deleted my account. I finally stood up for something and damn it feels good
someone help it says "submit ticket with image ID" and then it wants some picture and without it i cant delete my acc?
They are asking for an ID to delete the account and related data, pretty sure that's illegal here in the EU.

This article shows Mark Kern who helped develop WoW, with his explanation, while canceling his subscription to the game.
Just finished deleting my account as well. The invisible hand in our economy does not function if consumers dont stand for the values they expect their companies to abide by. Just because it isnt illegal, doesnt make it permissible.
I got to the step where I had to send an image of my ID, got confirmation that it was received, and have not heard anything since.  That was like 2 hours ago, anybody know how long it usually takes?
Blizzard has cancelled the ability to delete your account because they are seeing how many people disagree with their policies.  Just tried to delete mine, despite what I did. Wouldn't let me.
Update: I just got a response to my "Data Protection Request" to have my account and information deleted. For those that don't know they will automatically fail your attempts at using SMS Text or the Authenticator verification to submit leaving you with the only option of uploading your ID. I did so but redacted my DL # and other information not used in creating my account, so they had my name, address, photo of my ID...DENIED. Claimed it was illegible which is BS

I honestly even forgot that I had a account in the first place, might as well make it where I don't have one.
Ive been trying but it says that there was too many failed attempts to delete my account even though I only tried once for both the secret code and the question.
Done. Just deleted my account... Or asked them to delete it any way. Hope I get a reply soon.
Thank you, just deleted my account
Yeah not letting me delete account, says sms code is denied, even though it's accurate, locks down sms protect, send email code, says it's denied, even though it's accurate. Try contact support, send email code, says it's denied, even though it's accurate.

Joke of a company...
Not letting me delete account. SMS is blocked, no code from authenticator. Spent over 1k in HS, but I will never play Blizzard again.
Tried to delete it, followed the thing to do the sms security and it then denied it saying i had too many attempts. Now support refuses to answer me. The only other option is to send a picture of my driver's license over the internet to some random person. What the fuck?
I don't feel comfortable sending them a picture of my ID at all, is there a way around that?
Unsubbed from classic. :(
I'm out.  I'll monitor the situation but I don't see anything changing.  If it does and Blizzard decides to unbend the knee to Communists for the sake of their bottom line, then I'll reconsider.
Do I have to use a Gov ID to delete my account or is there a different way?
They require my government issued ID to delete my account? That's fucking BULLSHIT! So they can turn around and sell it to their buddies in China?
Blizzard is asking me for my government ID to delete my account. What the F
I cant delete my account without photo id  
WTF!!!
I bought Warcraft 1 when it came out, on a 486.  Naturally, I also had all the Warcrafts including WOW, Starcraft and Diablo as well.  I've been a Blizzard fan for many many many years.  I just deleted both of my accounts.
i wanna delete my account but i paid like $50 for overwatch when it came out smh
Sent a request to delete my acount. Had to provide an I'd
They will not let me delete my account or my children's accounts without photoID. I have never given them photoID, so it seems odd they need that for comparison?

I tried to log a call, but they will not let me even log a call or contact helpdesk in any way, without photoID.

Has anybody else gotten around this? I am in EU and covered by GDPR, my children are under 16.
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d3/t/mind-closing-my-account-blizzard/3909

asking on the forums is a no go as well. i attempted the email code and secret question methods first which resulted in...

‚ÄúDue to too many attempts, Email Code has been locked. Please try another method for verification.‚Äù and ‚ÄúDue to too many attempts, Secret Question has been locked. Please try another method for verification.‚Äù

after the first attempt on each option which left me with the ‚ÄúClick here to create a request. You may be required to submit a government issue photo ID.‚Äù option and i'm not about to go that route.

they want the account *that* badly? keep it. i've since uninstalled bnet, and there are private multiplayer servers for a pretty good number of pc games these days. i've no doubt that there are private aka "unofficial" servers for D2 and it's expansion as well.

oh, and shame on the mvp, MissCheetah trying to pull shit like the following on me before closing my first forum post.

MissCheetah: ‚ÄúToo many times people have maliciously tried to wipe accounts of family/exs, etc.‚Äù

not my problem and if you require photo ID to verify the ownership of an account you have some serious problems YOU need to deal with as none of that is mine to deal with.

me: ‚ÄúI live in the US where we have freedom of speech as a constitutional right.‚Äù

MissCheetah: ‚ÄúPlease understand though, it ONLY applies to freedom from the Govt prosecuting you. It does not extend to private entities like homes, workplaces, companies, forums, games.‚Äù

good ol‚Äô private company BS.

listen, if you require a person to provide photo ID to close an account then your company has some serious problems that have nothing to do with me which it needs to take care of.

want the account? keep it. you're not getting anything else from me ever again as i am one of those who has embraced the phrase "vote with your wallet" when it comes to video games.

also worth noting is the chinese company Tencent now has a pretty large stake in blizzard if one of sidalpha's recent videos is to be believed. what was it...well, it was something above 35% anyway.

tencent is getting into our video games, our movies (they're the publisher for the newest terminator movie), i wonder where else their power has reached... o_O me thinks china is getting a bit too big for their pants...
Thanks, done.
Canceled my account as well (everything the whole battlenet )
Tried ESO but the game is even more money hungry then wow plus lootboxes system :( game is fun though played 40 hours after all, just wouldnt invest extra money for it
Deleted. Used to play SC2, and WoW way back in the day... what a spineless and ignorant move by Blizzard
So how do I delete it without sending my photoID because that's not happening
Done!
Blizzard wants a photo of my "government ID" to be able to delete my account. Completely unprecedented. Have never had this request from ANY company before. Obviously they are not getting that or any money from me or my friends again.
I just created 6 different tickets for Blizzard support and named them DELETE MY ACCOUNT

Everyone who does not want to send photo of government ID could do this.

And attach appropriate Hong Kong support picture instead of ID etc.
I just submitted to delete my account. So I lost my Hearthstone, Diablo 3 and Overwatch games and purchases? Good.
Seems to be working now, verification code that was sent via SMS was accepted and deletion of account is processing.
tip: Photo-ID is required. I send photo of my passport with face and SS-number covered, and my request was "accepted and is now in processing". Ill update when it completes
so i tried deleting it but methot to verify my identity is an image of my ID... and since i of course never used my real name.... well played
Send GDPR data request, far worse
I went to cancel mine, and it demanded I submit a photo ID. I downloaded and attached goatse. Then I bleached my eyes.
Even I not playing anymore, I had almost all games and feels kind of sad to delete my old wow account, that I played for 10+ years.
But, I simple implicit endorse this kind of totalitarianism.
They updated that page two hours ago. Huh, makes you think.
Requested to remove my account and delete my info.
This post doesn't appear in the "Top" posts, weird
20 year old account with thousands invested deleted.
Thanks!

Kinda feels good thb.
OMG!!! I was trying to figure out how to do this for so long. Thank you!
Three words for you Blizzard. 

Cancelled. 

Unsubscribed.

Deleted.
Not anymore
I canceled my blizzard subs, they won't get anymore of my time or money but I'm also not going to outright delete something that I've spent thousands of dollars on.

Though I feel terrible for saying that.
Done! [https://imgur.com/a/eTCWtP0](https://imgur.com/a/eTCWtP0)
Storm BlizzCon 2019, They Can‚Äôt Stop All Of Us
I canceled my wow sub as well.

But just curious does uninstalling the games actually matter? Like is  that something they keep track of or notice in anyway?
Done this morning. Will uninstall all my games later today. Just one more comment for the social media monitors to notice.

Also, I was super looking forwardto Vampire: Bloodlines 2, but turns out ActivisionBlizzard are the publishers,so scratch that. Which is a real shame.
Was so so so looking forward to warcraft 3 reforged. 

Account is deleted now, they'll never get any more of my money for Wow or hearthstone or any other title ever again.
I uploaded a photo of my Australian driver's licence and my request was denied. The support ticket  is marked as "issue resolved" which it clearly isn't. This is very frustrating. They are not letting me delete my account.
Canceled
# Delete Blizzard Account

Updated: 5 hours ago 		    


there's a lot of request made since this page had been updated   


so they state the following   
This will also result in a permanent loss of the following:  

* Purchase history
* Purchased games, codes, promotions, and in-game items
* Game accounts and all game progress
* Communications with Blizzard Customer Support
* Any remaining Blizzard Balance
So is anyone else getting a request for photo ID when you try to cancel your subscription? I'd rather not give Blizzard any more personal info than is necessary, and this seems like a weird request from them considering they didn't need my photo ID to create my account in the first place...
I asked them why I could not delete my account with SMS verifyer and they told me the following
"This has been the requirements since we implemented GDPR features on our system, it was never possible to authenticate ownership with any other method for account deletion requests.

We are happy to comply with a request for deletion, upon receipt of requested identification. Requests without sufficient identification will be declined, as appropriate by GDPR legislation"

I think they are lying cause I saw a post where a guy said they removed the sms verifyer and this lier is saying they never had it?
Done.
Cancelled and deleted everything Blizzard.  The whole company can burn for all I care now. Absolutely disgusted by the whole thing.
Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

I want to delete my Blizzard Account but upon clicking the link for deletion the only method of verification is my real ID. I live in europe and this is not something that can be asked. I read several threads mentioning the same issue and I wrote a ticket about it. I thought this issue was already solved because so many people doing the same before?
I can now delete my account. They removed the ID requirement. Just had  to put in an email code and it was now accepted. So give it a try if  your deletions were being artificially restricted earlier.
thanks for this good post! Just deleted my account
Subscription canceled. Account deleted. Fuck Blizzard.
And...... unsubbed, uninstalled & deleted. 

You don't deserve my $$ Blizzard. 

Shame on you.
Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh,
Chubby, little cubby all stuffed with fluff.
He's Winnie the Pooh, Winnie the Pooh,
Willy, nilly, silly old bear.
Deleted mine just now. Also won‚Äôt be interested to care whatever they release in the future
Done and done!
Blizzard accounts cancelled sell your stock asap
Thanks for the link. Account deleted.
üôè thank you. Will not be renewing subscription.

As far as im aware my VERY old account died in Honk Kong
I figured [this image](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fi0.kym-cdn.com%2Fphotos%2Fimages%2Foriginal%2F001%2F260%2F123%2F405.png&f=1&nofb=1) would suffice for my ID.

They could honestly be collecting them to send off to China. Who knows.
[deleted]
i tried once and they said "too many attempts try another verification method"

they reaallly trying to keep customers i don't know how to delete my shti im gonna just bitch at fucking support i guess

Just deleted, thanks. Sent a nice F U email too. Felt good
Canceled my wow sub idk this just felt like the breaking point for me with Blizzard as a company.
I'm deleting my blizzard account. Fuck China
20 year old battle.net account deleted.

Goodbye Kait.
Gimme a "Nice." If you deleted your accounts today.
Because that's what real heroes do.
I‚Äôm glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family‚Äôs organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
#Hijacking your comment to say, if you or anyone your know plans on deleting their account, don't just delete your account! You can request your Data from Blizzard and if they dont follow trhough within 30 days they have to pay hefty fines inside the EU. If everyone does this, they might have such an enormous backlog and will have to pay up. More details here: https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfcncg/dont_just_delete_your_account_you_can_request/
An overwhelming thank you!
me too
thanks
If you have more time (like another 2 months) left on your subscription, do they refund you the money from the next two months? Or are you out the whole payment?
r/blizzardchina
Now delete the account. I'm losing Diablo III, but it's fine.
You went from a hero in game to a hero irl
I know there are a lot of memes and posts going around - but what you did actually made a difference unlike all these karma farming posts. Canceling a wow sub while wanting to play in order to stand for something bigger is commendable. THAT is a tough choice to make. Good on you. I hope more folks follow in your footsteps. I stopped playing wow a while back so i simply uninstalled my client.
Canceled mine today too even though I was stoked about classic WoW for months before they released it and have been really enjoying the hell out of it so far.  Sad day, but my principles matter more than a video game.  I sure hope they feel this backlash where it hurts.  Maybe if enough of us unsubscribe it will speak to them in a language they understand.
Cancelled as well. Sad because I was having a great time with my friends in classic, oh well there are other games.
same here
I just got back into the game and have a great guild and really don‚Äôt want to cancel my subscription... but sometimes standing up for something and having morals is more important than a game.  I will be cancelling my subscription as well. Which hurts. I hope blizzard makes this right soon.
Dude, I‚Äôm gonna quit playing overwatch totally but that‚Äôs nothing cuz I was pretty much over it. You on the other hand, good for you man. I know it sucks but honestly I hope you take greater satisfaction in what you did in solidarity with other people than whatever enjoyment you would have gotten playing a game. You‚Äôre a righteous guy and that goes for anyone who stops supporting Blizzard even though they want to play these games still.
When I get home I will be uninstalling all my blizzard games and battle net. I was really bothered by the "you guys don't have phones" attitude but this is the straw that broke the camel's back. I will miss overwatch and starcraft but liberty is way more important to me.
Cancelled mine and sold shares in blizz. Good ol day
Cancelled mine as well as well as left them a message politely explaining that I was permanently boycotting all Blizzard products until an official apology and reversal was made by the company. 

Uninstalling the client and all the games as I type this.
Really was looking forward to finally seeing the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj being opened in real time in Classic, among other cool shit. Finally being able to play the last zones of Classic WoW without skipping over them for a new expansion.

My sub is still good until February but I'm stopping today. Good time to get back to my Switch Backlog. Fuck Blizzard.
Man, my sub renewed yesterday and I was stoked to be playing WoW again but after seeing this today it's definitely time to cancel and not play.
Same
That's how I feel about Classic. Was pumped since the announcement, but hey there's plenty of other MMOs. Or maybe for the first time since the 90s I'll try living without one
Come play Albion online, it‚Äôs got a cool classic feel with lots of its own cool mechanics, and it‚Äôs free too
/salute
Even if it's just for 1 month it should be enough to send a message. Take a month off and enjoy the extra time/money :D
214?
When I talked to support they wouldn't let me delete it, so instead I'm banned from the forums for a millennium and muted in-game for 36 hours. :(
Time to come over to osrs
Canceled my sub when I got home from work today.  In the reason block I just put " Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our age!"
Not a WOW player but was really looking forward to reforged... not anymore. Ill just go ahead and get RDR2 on PC for my winter game now. I got to spend a week in HK a few years ago and had a hotel right near the noonday gun and got to hear the boom every day while there. Beautiful city and great people.
Join us over at /r/ffxiv! We're getting a new patch later this month
I don't play, but I've had my pre-order for Warcraft 3 Reforged cancelled. Was really fucking excited for that. But Fuck Blizzard.
Ditto with unsubbing. Was excited for the new story for this patch but no stories worth what they pulled.
[LOL they took it down](https://i.imgur.com/JqZWq8F.png?1)
The joy of one isn't worth the freedom of 7.392 million, but every sacrifice counts.
Well done!
You made the right decision.
Same here. I was really enjoying BFA so far. But we got to do what we can for what we believe in.
Your sacrifice is not in vain
Joined, deleted my account as well, done... but they don‚Äôt care... China is big
You did the right thing.
Check out GW2 or FF14
Man I was so close to hitting 60 in classic. Oh well there's plenty of other games to play. The new FFXIV patch drops in a couple of days. Time to check it out.
Yeah it sucks. I was considering resubbing since 8.3 looked really good. But I might as well not even bother now.
Same. I have really been enjoying Classic since its launch, and was really looking forward to playing more. I'm still hoping Blizzards makes this right, but that is seeming unlikely
Play FFXIV instead
Yeah, just as it was starting to look more interesting to me.

Welp.


I know a lot of people are saying they'll wait to see long term reactions to this, but I won't. It'll all be crocodile tears at the absolute best.

Been a fan since WC2 launched, and I'm out forever now.
Same and I‚Äôm enjoying classic, but hey come to archeage with me... comes out October 15th and they don‚Äôt censor or trample human rights... that I know of
Same man, same.
I‚Äôm glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family‚Äôs organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
yeah it hurts, I just started classic like 3 days ago with a friend and it has been a really enjoyable time. Still put into delete my account. I can have fun in another game that doesn't ban players at the request of China.
this is so fucking stupid lol
I don‚Äôt see any of your comments with platinum...where did you get it?
I've been loving Classic, and I wish I could keep playing but this is just too much.

Blizzard has been arrogant and condescending to its fanbase for years. I could tolerate that. But this? No, I'm done.
Reddit is not owned by Tencent.
**Let me use the same retarded deduction methods as you people:**   
**YOU** actively use Reddit --- *OOOH YES!*  
**Tencent** is a Chinese government-owned company -- *OH NO BAD GUYS!*  
**Tencent** invested a good amount in Reddit  --- *OH GOD WHY?!*  


Your patronage = Revenue for Tencent = Revenue for the Chinese government = You support the Chinese regime!  


**GOOD JOB! :D - Now will you all stop using Reddit as well? Or conveniently remain active on the site like the hypocrite dumbasses you are?**
Reddit isn't owned by Tencent. They have a stake of something like 5%.
Check out the free trial for FFXIV. It's a pretty fun alternative, the gameplay flow is quite different.
Fuck tencent
they aren‚Äôt owned by tencent. while i understand the appeal of a false narrative like that, perpetuating it is dangerous.
I cancelled WoW back in Legion because frankly that game is toxic as fuck anyway, but I was really looking forward to the Warcraft 3 remaster.  Not anymore.  There are always other games to play.
Im glad im a f2p casual hearthstone player. I aint paying any dime
I hope your char was an ally. Good riddance if so.
Come play FF14!!! It‚Äôs Japanese based game and they will never cave into China government regime.
just cancelled mine which sucks because I was just starting to enjoy classic
Same boat :(
Blizzard is not worth my time or money.

Human Rights before phat loot. Fuck.
Just play private server instead. A lot of people are moving there ^^
Hold strong man you're doing the right thing. God you are.
Good move
I straight up deleted my characters on classic. Good bye blizzard.
Same here. F blizzard.
Many other games that are a lot better.
Same. I used all 500 characters to lament how far the company has fallen. I said that I was really excited that wow seemed to be turning around. I planned to play wow classic for several months, and Visions of N'Zoth actually looked like content that would excite me back into retail. Given Ion's Wow update, I felt pretty good about Blizzcon and 9.0. I wonder if Ion ever thought his favorite hobby would put him on the side of the Chinese Government when he was number-crunching C'thun in Elitist Jerks.

It is so unfortunate that the dev team keeps getting shit on by the business side, but now it's gone from "predatory micro-transactions I can tolerate" to "full-blown capitulation to oppressive government that feels wrong to support, even indirectly".

They made a matter of consumer disagreement into a civic issue... just for money. And to those who say "yea, that's just corporations", I agree... but when are we going to decide that we aren't ok with that? Will it be Blizzard?
I still havent touched a Blizzard product since last Blizzcon, guess I'll just continue with that.
Freedom above all my dude. Respects where it due for what you did.
Likewise, was looking forward to resubbing before end of BFA; get all that sweet content without the time gating.

Now, after this, I can't imagine ever returning to a single Blizzard product.

Please Blizzard, I love your games (I may not have time for them) but you need to come out and rectify this and stand up to what's wrong. I don't forsee how that'll work with China owning a percentage of Blizzard Activision and Riot and Epic... I mean the landscape seems immovable.

I think we need big influencers and us the fans to do what we can, and hope for the best.

Is there a posituve resolution to this, at least from Blizzard? Any redemption?
Private servers bro
Starcraft is the only game I play anymore, I'm really sad that I have to stop playing :(
Yep, that'd be a cancel from me as well.  Also got a refund on my pre-order of WC3.
Play RuneScape :3
Delete your battle.net account coward. Do it
Well done, ton of other games and developers that you can support in the meantime.
my respect to you
*snap* this is going in my cringe compilation
Imagine being this cucked
Prove it and I'll send you $50. I bet you're a lying, virtue signaling douche tool.


Edit: I was wrong. We came to an agreement, I sent him $ and he sent it back because he's a good dude. I was wrong.
Did you also sell your pc and phone both of which are made in China if not in whole absolutely had parts made in China?
Well said

I concurr. Closing mine as we speak. Fuck them.
Amen. I've been playing since Starcraft and I have so many memories playing and have spent so many hours watching streams of SC/SC2/WC3/Hearthstone but this is totally just so far from that company from yesteryear. Uninstalled everything, won't be looking back.
Now that's the perfect reply I've been trying to come up with for the past few hours. Second end!
Agreed
I've already raised a ticket for them to delete my account as well. I loved them back in the days of Diablo 2 / Warcraft 3, and was waiting with anticipation for announcement of their new games. But nowadays this company went to shit.
Same. Subscription is gone. Sad times for us to see the  true Monster that our money has turned into.

Fuck your subscription money right up yo facist ass.
I wont play anything new, but I'll still play stuff like warcraft 2, starcraft 2, you know, stuff that was made before all this
Yeah.. but have you deleted your account?
Me too. Cancelled everything.

Subscriptions to wow are long gone now. Launcher and games deleted never to come back unless underground servers. Fuck Activision and blizzard, aswell as ea, Ubisoft and rockstar.

Suck my big fat bohemia interactive dick
Same! Fuck em. Loved their games and spend too much time and money on HoTS and Hearthstone, but I'm not supporting this bs.

I tried every option to receive the code for deletion and they were all locked. SMS, authenticator, email, secret question... None work. I wonder if they disabled it or I just screwed up
Eli5?
Which email should i send the request to?
I think this only applies to EU citizens, but it's a pretty funny way to spite them if their process isn't fully automated. Might provide you with some interesting data too.
Just googled GDPR. I'm from the US and it seems to be an EU thing and there isn't a link for it in the US battle.net, but I tried the link from the EU battle.net and it seems to be working for me.

I've sent an E-Mail to them :D
Well done! That‚Äôs no small thing it looks like you were really invested.
Fuck yes
That ia awesome and exactly what makes us human. Unlike these shitty corporations that silence people to take chinazi money
Me and my wife and kids unsubbed.  Games uninstalled.  If we don‚Äôt hear a response / ‚Äústatement‚Äù soon, we‚Äôre deleting the accounts.  They better make it right.  That‚Äôs all we can say on the matter
Same boat. I don't want to write the account off to zero because I'm a bit of a hoarder, but I haven't signed in since they killed Heroes really, and don't see myself signing in ever again now. Future is probably phone apps anyway.

I know also if they are able to get me to, it will be with a huge amount of repulsion. I don't see them overcoming that.
Honestly I don't see issue in playing the single player games offline. Already spent the money and only person that loses is me if I destroy everything. And should Blizzard redeem itself I'd rather not have to buy what I had again.
Uninstalling hearthstone was hard, but fuck them. Video games are a great way to take a break from reality, not ignore it.
Same here! Me and my GF both did it \^\_\^
Now delete your blizzard account. So you can‚Äôt just reinstall when this blows over.
I just blacked out everything including my face on the image I gave them. The only thing visible is my name, address and date of birth which is information they already had.
In their terms of service they say that they'll ban anyone under 13 or if you made your account before 13. Tell them you are 10 or something and they'll ban you. I did this myself a couple years ago because blizzard is shit.

I have the option to use an SMS code. However, when inputting and entering the code I received, I get "Denied" on the page. It then refreshes and says "Due to too many attempts, SMS Protect Code has been locked. Please try another method for verification."

Mind you, I got this message on my first attempt at entering the code. I am unsure whether this is due to them receiving an unusually large number of requests that this particular service has gone down or if it's an attempt to get as many ID photographs as possible.
cancel subscriptions but its not a good idea to delete your account.  just don't log into it.  

basically blizzard will make more money from people who will re-buy their products later.  this happens when people burn things in protest, it just increases sales from whatever it is they protest.

dont burn your own property
I have an Authenticator, I got one during WotLK. That worked for me
I sent them a photo of my ID with my middle finger next to it...It's the little victories.
Right?? I went to delete my account and tried with sms and was told no, try a different method. I used the Authenticator app and was told no, try a different method. So now I have to give my ID? They don‚Äôt even have my ID on file right now as is, why give it to them now? Slimey dickheads.
lol what?! photo id to DELETE an account?
Best part is that the opposition to this has been bipartisan. I've seen BOTH Ron Wyden (d) and Marco Rubio (r) speak out against what the NBA did and I'm sure they'd do the same with Blizzard.

Read the linked post.  
  
You posted the question after the AMA ended. It's misleading to suggest it was dodged. You can almost guarantee this kind of question to be asked in future debates. It's a good question, just asked too late.
This is correct at least for some. Interned in Senate in 2013 - we (unpaid interns) processed all calls and letters. We just gave a weekly spreadsheet to the intern coordinator of issues with how many times a constituent wrote / called about that issue. That's it. Not a thing more. No names, no specifics, nada.

FTFY
I also can't, and I was wondering the same thing. Immediately denied as too many attempts even though I never had a single failed attempt. No method is working. Basically, my data is being held hostage.
I had the same problem, but I tried two more times and it worked. Goodbye Blizzard..
The tickets do get generated though. Check the ticket tab
[deleted]
I kind of agree with you. unless these people who are deleting their blizzard accounts are also doing the same with the Google, Apple, Microsoft and the whole list of other companies that are more than happy to comply with China's oppressive regulations...
this is a bad opinion from a bootlicker. civil obedience gets things done.
Okay Mr. Jinping thank you for your input.
Whatever helps you sleep at night bud. Need a new organ? I heard they have a fresh bunch up for sale.
Did you read the rule? It does not say to not go into politics or didn't exclude anything specificaly. The rule says first and foremost that it is applied by decission of blizzard if a player speaks or acts in a way that reflects badly on blizzard. The player made a statement in favor of human rights. If that rule applies it obviously signals, that Blizzard has more interest in chinese approval than approval of human rights as the decision was at Blizzard to make.

Of course after the statement Blizzard would have some bad reflection from either side (so technicallly you could argue that it is a broken rule either way), but as the rule states Blizzard could have decided to not apply it at their discretion and thus chose which side they were on. (Also, the rule does not apply to the two casters that were fired.)

I personally am happy for the incident as it has given more attention to the Hong Kong protests and Blizzards interessets. 
If rules are questionable they must be broken at some point, that is part of progress.
"if you want things to change, try and change them"

Yeah that's what people are doing you bootlicker.
I quit playing Blizzard shit a little while ago, and quite frankly, having my purchase history and whole account deleted feels like the best message I could possibly send. It's not really so important to me that many more do this alongside me, but the best and most effective message I could possibly send Blizzard.  


I have over a decade of history on my account, trashing that and giving absolute finality to the end of my relationship with Blizzard over this issue feels really fantastic. There is no going back and no way I can patron them again in any capacity after this.
I agree that he was fully aware of thr consequences that he could face, but to expect things to change without changing the things you do is not going to happen. You need to break the rules to put a spotlight on things that certain people don't want to see. The problem here is that with trying to supress political statements in their community, Blizzard were stating a political Statement themself. Even if they are not pro-China, it heavily implies it with their actions and the way they handled the situation.
It‚Äôs not a strict rule, it says at blizzards sole discretion they (or their stakeholders in this case) can decide what‚Äôs offensive. The punishment is also not clearly defined obviously, they chose to immediately ban/fire. 

Also it‚Äôs not the punishment itself but what it represents. That profit motives rule over civil rights. They‚Äôre setting a precedent for all companies down the line and if the people let it slide they‚Äôre mortgaging their own futures.
You are wrong, did you read the rule? It's about the public image. And if endorsing freedom is now against the public image, fuck Blizzard! It's a disgrace for the public image of Blizzard, btw!
> There‚Äôs a reason there are rules. You guys deleting your accounts/unsubbing are ridiculous and a tiny minority. As much as I support Hong Kong protests, THERE IS A STRICT RULE DISALLOWING INVOLVEMENT WITH SUCH THINGS FOR TOURNAMENT PLAYERS. I‚Äôm sorry you all think this rule shouldn‚Äôt apply to someone, but get the hell over yourself and grow the hell up.

please die
You can argue about him breaking the rules... But  what about the casters that were just there and didn't do anything wrong (according to what ive heard) why did they have to be fired?
He broke tournament rules and should face an appropriate punishment. Alright, I can respect that.

The rule he broke says anyone breaking it would get his grandmaster status revoked and his winnings voided. That's already pretty harsh, but Blizzard wend beyond that and also banned him for a full year, which is a career ending move for a pro player.

Then they censored any discussion on the incident on all of their forums, and wrote an apology on the Chinese version of their website stating that they would continue to safeguard the dignity of the state.

Beurrrg
This exact conversation happened in the nba sub.  Please pay attention to who you trust. The Chinese are actively trying to change our opinions
What about the Commentators?
I'll also add, deleting games that you've already paid for is stupid as shit, you already gave them your money, why would they care if you're not going to play anymore (Besides WOW of course). I'm not going to give them anymore money, but I'm also not going to stop playing/delete Diablo II either, since I've already paid for it
Wait breaking rules of a company which allows voluntary basis tournaments? Vs using public space to express the wrongness of governments? Yeah. I guess you're right, don't use social opportunities to better human rights. We shouldn't break rules, yeah. We will leave other governments to do that for us, but you know, we will play our games quietly and follow the code of the game tournament.
Da fuk
Fucking bootlicker
> There‚Äôs a reason there are rules. 

So what.  What if those reasons are bad?  "There's a reason" is the stupidest argument for anything.  I 100% agree with Kibler on this.  It was a completely out of line and over-the-top reaction from Blizzard.

> If you want things to change, try and change them. 

That's what cancelling a subscription is you knob.  Do you think you have a voice louder than the money you spend?  You don't.  The people canceling are the ones actually trying to do something in a way that may effect change in a company like blizzard (fuck blizzard).  

You are a stooge and your attitude and philosophy make the world a worse place.  Congrats on being like that.
And that's why the casters were banned too?
That's why they took his prize money even if they didn't have to according to their own rules?
That's why they've completely removed cameras and interviews from HS tournaments?
The rule is not strict. It literally is at their discretion. https://i.imgur.com/4X2Y2y3.jpg
Shill
The thing that you don't realize is that these companies always write up a TON of legal garbage that they won't usually enforce but keep around just in case they need it. It's not about "breaking a rule", it's just blizzard covering their ass. That "rule" that you talk about is in a freaking 19 pages pdf only about the 2019 HS tournament.

Companies do that all the time. For example one of Steam's distribution agreements is that companies have to submit their game application no later than the FIRST commercial release but we all know games being on console or other player getting to steam later is the norm.

You can try to claim that people are immature for not being mindless fanboys like you but in the end you didn't even know what you were talking about.
Yea, people bitch and complaing all the time about special treatment and celebs or politicians  being above the law and let off with crimes.

Then when a celeb that you all like does it or a company you all like is involved. Suddenly it's a case of "let him off with it".

You're all a joke and i dont believe a single one of you unsubbed.. or if you did you were done playing anyway
They exercised their right to ban him and people are exercising their rights to delete their account and no longer support Blizzard. What's the issue?
To make a statement breaking bad rules and laws is good. Look at the civil rights movement, many of the things they did was illegal but morally right. If he spoke out later, we would not have seen how enslaved Blizzard is to China
You don't truly support the protests then. Simple as that
The winner in the last Hearthstone contest spoke in an interview in favor of the Honk Kong struggle to freedom.

As a response, Blizzard took away his prize money 250K $, deleted the interview and banned him for a year from the game.
I tried a few times, and while i had this error on the first try, it did work after the third!
I sent them the ID, wtf are they gonna do. Account deleted. ‚úåÔ∏è
Same here the code they sent me doesn't even work lol
Just try again. It worked on my third try.
Gotta keep them numbers up for the stockholders. . .
I am getting this too but it is actually illegal to make a copy of an ID here which would be somwhat problematic ..

Unless you just put on a lot of black bars to block out privacy related info, which would mute the whole point of sending it ..

Not that Blizzard would actually be able to verify if an ID is valid.
You're probably better off without it. It's too addictive
At this point, I think you‚Äôre safe to enjoy an official copy of Diablo 2 without supporting Blizzard.
I think they just turned it off hoping it will blow over.
Received the same messages for both the SMS and authentication app. It's disturbing they want a government issued ID.

I won't be doing that with how enthusiastically they're supporting a regime that tortures, murders, steals and throws minorities in concentration camps. 

I've cancelled my subscription. I uninstalled. I'll wait this out and then delete it later on.
Just try again a few times. It worked for me!
Seeing this a ton from lots of people. An attempt to curb the quit wave I guess
Just try again. It worked for me!
>Silmarillion (I probably spelled it wrong)

Nope, you got it! (also have it sitting on my desk at home.  Perhaps I'll finally finish it!)

China is such a small part of their revenue.
will do!
they removed it :(
You are making the right decision. People used to die over causes like this in the past, we gotta take a stand.
Same. I think they have disabled this service in order to reduce the amount of people deleting their accounts.
Getting this as well, actually even when I just logged into battle net in my browser i got a text saying my account was locked. So I think this is a deliberate response to control the damage.
Ah, so its not just me. Good.
I sent them a picture of WinnieXiPooh. We'll see how the poor customer service rep responds. I feel bad for them, but I suspect the SMS and email verification was intentionally disabled or throttled to keep things like this from happening.
Ha right, I wish I still had a wow sub to fuck them with.
Wow, whatever translator app you put that in didn't do a great job.
China wants to know who stands against them
My mate raised a ticket just stating they were an EU dual national and it got sorted really quickly. Support didn't ask.
Exact same, did the SMS code and it won't take it saying SMS Code verification is locked. I'll try the Pooh pic now too.
it seems like they were probably hit or expected many people to quit from their service and have put a block on it as I am unable to to delete my account as well first attempt resulted in a too many times even though I can know full well I entered the code sent to me
Keep trying.the system is experiencing a volume of traffic.  It took me 3x but it took.
I'm pretty certain you can. Nothing should be tied to Battle.net at all l, just bungie.net and steam and then whatever console you play on (if applicable)
Don't stifle progress simply because it is small
Awww, you just gotta get your whataboutism in dont ya?  Don't worry, we don't give a fuck about your faux support.
When I spoke to the woman at the call-center they had been receiving a lot of cancellation requests and she seemed like she was having a bad day.  She managed to stay positive but I could tell it was wearing on her.
You have to use the link to submit a ticket with photo id...the automated verifications won't work for this.
Its about doing whats right, not what's profitable. History will look back on this as a moment where a company could have stood up and done the morally correct thing but instead crumbled like a coward. I'm sure I speak for most people here when I say its worth deleting my account knowing that *my* money will no longer be contributing to that.
That's fine. The market outside China will remain significant.  If we stop giving our money to firms which sell out to the PRC a market is created for media and products more in line with our values.
Same for me. It gave me that message on the first attempt, and the second - I gave up after that.
Yes
Yep. Uploaded my ID and all.
they're scared
I am
I'm getting the same thing.
Exactly same thing, I opened a ticket for it to the support, hoping it would be quick.
Check mate, red party
Don't hold it back, brother
there is a reason apple stopped production in China and are shifting completely to India..

Samsung has their biggest phone manufacturing plant in India...

Everyone is moving out of China gradually :)
You will regret deleting your account once this backlash is forgotten a few days from now.
I got the same thing as well. Posted on here too, to see if anyone else got the same thing. Glad I‚Äôm not the only one but it just seems strange.
Do what you want coward but leave us be.
[deleted]
Well, if we were all so selfish it wouldn't make a difference.  Thankfully, going through the thousands of posts in this sub where people are doing just that proves that you're just a tool.
I'm not sure why you think that. Blizzard's account deletion process is currently overwhelmed - I literally cannot delete my Blizzard account right now because SMS Protect Code and Authenticator Code got DDoS'd.
How do you do this?  
and they also updated this 3 hours ago on how to delete your account, so I think the data is removed either way.  


"If you wish to delete your account, you may create a request to remove personal information from your account. Proceeding with this erasure request will permanently remove or anonymize all personal information from your Blizzard Account.

Information that will be removed or anonymized includes:

* Name
* Contact information (email, phone number, etc)
* Security details
* Saved payment methods

This will also result in a permanent loss of the following:

* Purchase history
* Purchased games, codes, promotions, and in-game items
* Game accounts and all game progress
* Communications with Blizzard Customer Support
* Any remaining Blizzard Balance"
Same thing after only one attempt.

Came here to see if others were having the same issue.
block out everything except your name.
"I have submitted a ticket to delete my Blizzard account. I was once an avid WoW and SC2 player, but Blizzard's recent spineless and undemocratic censorship has caused me to leave Blizzard. Unless Blizzard undoes its cowardly and illiberal policy of bowing to China's censorship whims, I will never participate in Blizzard activities again. 

&#x200B;

Sadly,

\[name\]"
cover everything except your name.
Did the same with my driver's license, blocking face, address, and birth-date. They don't know what I look like to begin with, so the picture shouldn't matter anyway.

Update:  Request was denied. I've opened a support ticket asking why they need to see my face to delete my account, assuming I haven't provided my likeness to Blizzard to begin with.
Lmao
Deleted my main account!! They're giving me trouble with deleting my second one though I'll try kater
Yep, and they denied all my attempts when I blocked out most of the important details and my picture.
Bli$$ard
If you want to make a real difference, donate it to a homeless shelter or something man.
Same issue. Had to remove authenticator and change password before the request went through.
this is apparently not a bug; it‚Äôs a feature.
Side note, as someone who used to work in support... dont be a dick, the reps are prolly having REALLY bad days with assholes cancelling. Be the one person to cheer em up if possible. :)
Or follow instructions nest time instead of being an asshole.
nice
nice
Nice
And the world could always use a few more, whether Blizzard ever believed those words or not.

Uninstalling everything and deleting my account right now.
Only if you want to hit them where it hurts... I did that long ago and did not regret it a second :)
Delete your characters. Don't tempt yourself to go back once it's all fizzled out
You got me in the first half, not gonna lie.
Honestly not too worried to pursue something like that, I just wanted to contribute to the massive amount of deletions sure to follow
Imagine losing a character you spent 14 years building.
indeed, i wish people would sacrifice just a little to help stand up for what is right, human rights and freedom for your fellow man. we used to die for these things and much much less is being asked to achieve it. im a pessimist though i really dont think much is going to change from this. one can hope though but people have become so complacent anymore the overlords and tyrants will do as these please
I agree,I cant enjoy playing a game from a company that doesn't care about human rights and only about money,its not human anymore.
Let's not mince words. This does not make anyone a hero. The real heros are those fighting for their freedom
#If you or anyone your know plans on deleting their account, don't just delete your account! You can request your Data from Blizzard and if they dont follow trhough within 30 days they have to pay hefty fines inside the EU. If everyone does this, they might have such an enormous backlog and will have to pay up. More details here: https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfcncg/dont_just_delete_your_account_you_can_request/
This. Heroism is not being a Superman or anything like that. Heroism is doing the right thing, whenever you can.
Agreed with this guy. Yes we're all just drops in the ocean but that doesn't mean we give up and don't try. Even the thoughts in your head are meaningful. The desire for freedom is just an idea yes but powerful nonetheless.

Don't stop playing Overwatch, just continue playing it but never buy anything from Blizzard again. This means that they have to pay for increased server load but earn nothing from it.
Real liberty over wings of liberty? Nice.
Sold mine too, wasn't many (22) which is double edged. They might take a dive here anyways so win/win
This may be personal, but did you at least make money off of your shares? I hope so. Either way, i have mad respect for that.
I created a ticket, gave them 72 hours to reverse their decision or lose this customer for life. 

Ill back that up 100%, ive boycotted other companies for much less and kept my word. The games market is saturated, i dont need blizzard. I will not allow china to influence western culture this way.
Yeah, i was dumb and had a 6 month sub that i started a bit after classic came out...  Uninstalled the games and battlenet client already.
Ask for a refund on the sub if under 24 hours or do a chargeback
Cancelled ‚úì
Go back to Ultima Online. Ultima Online never did you wrong.
can i get a link to said game? pls
Go get yourself a couple bigmacs, on Blizzard. Lol
I need to change my username

Funny that I encountered your comment. I've been on edge about starting to continuing to play FF14 for a long time, been thinking about it a lot recently. It's one game that I regret most not playing actively, only played in Realm Reborn to lvl 50, but at that point 11 years mostly hardcore wow playing was just too much pressure to stay on that boat instead.

Now, I'm looking back at all those years and only thing I feel is regret for not playing FF14.
It's better that they have to choose between China and the West than choose China and still keep the West.
Well then they can move their headquarters to china when their us stock plummets and their us play base is cut to a quarter lol
You‚Äôd be surprised - asiapacific is only 12% of their revenue and China is only a part of that.
China is actually a small part of their revenue.  If even 20% of their american customers leave they'll lose more money than all of Asia provides them.

Seconding gw2
Then you must hate free speech? Why not join them over there?
Yes but I'm not actively paying them money....
Unfortunately I never made an ally toon above level like 50? I think? Their storylines always just bored me lol almost all of my toons are horde lol
Is it turn based like the old ff or is it the new play style?
Does it also include people talking about having a cringe compilation?
Okay give me a second you want to PayPal or cash app?
[https://imgur.com/a/RKXExYZ](https://imgur.com/a/RKXExYZ)  where's my money douche tool?
Can I get in on that fitty, too, douche tool?
I mean they didnt promise a man money publicly, strip him of it, and fire two people completely uninvolved. 

You must think in order to support something you must drop everything you are doing and fly to Hong Kong and join their protest huh? 

All black or white.

You need a phone in 2019, you dont need blizzard. 

Stop projecting and go hug your mom, she'll help with your insecurities, cause I dont give a shit about them.

Yeah, I did. Like I wrote. In my last reply. What, you need a screenshot?
What did rockstar do?
These guys going so erect for money that Bethesda is becoming that Shaggy ‚ÄúAre you Challenging me?‚Äù Meme.
Remember to enforce your right to be forgotten.
You should definitely not check out Tauri or one of the other private servers.
Hold on, what about Ubisoft at the moment? They do stupid things from time to time but they aren't terrible.
What did Ubisoft do? :(
You guys are weirdos man.

Yeah I get the sentiment, but wow classic is wow classic and GTA is GTA. Get outta here and dont forget to delete your steam account if you have one.
Send them a request for all your data and if everyone does it then they‚Äôll have to waste a ton of time and money fulfilling those requests.
There‚Äôs a form you can fill in on their site.  Just google blizzard Gdpr and the first result has a link to it.
Send it by post to be even more inconvenient for them.
Legally yes, but blizzard offers the data privacy request to everyone.  Probably easier than trying to figure out if you‚Äôre an EU citizen.
pretty soon going to apply in to US citizens too. New privacy laws in CA go into effect in 2020
Link please?
This comment is a gem.
They had us in the first half not gunna lie.
Lmao

But so true
Commit man
Did it work? If yes than I‚Äôll just do that.
Fuck, I blanked everything except my name and face. Fuck I shouldn't have given them my face.
So in other words, there was 0 point in blacking out anything.
My account doesn't even have any of that, I used a fake first and last initial (and somehow they didn't prevent me from doing that). What do now? I've been sending them pictures of my middle finger but they keep rejecting it as an invalid ID, but that's the most valid thing they're going to get...
Don't, because they get the money and don't have any expenses. Instead just don't buy anything from them and play often. This means they have to pay the power bill for increased server load, and they don't earn anything from it.
I‚Äôm glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family‚Äôs organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
Lol I just sent that, let's see what they say
I wasn‚Äôt given that option unfortunately.
I got that too, but with email code verification. It's possible they've disabled that functionality due to an influx of deletion attempts.
Yup same here got that after the first attempt aswell. If you noticed you can see they changed the delete your account page 12 hours ago.. i feel like they made changes like this to discourage players from deleting their accounts.
No, to delete all information they've collected on you over the years, including your account.
That was my reaction when I got to that point
Rubio *did* speak out about Blizzard. Most sensible thing he's done in a hot minute. But it wasn't because people are being oppressed, killed, or farmed. It's because China is trying to assert their censorship internationally, and they're telling non-citizens what they can and can't say. Whatevs, I'll take it.
what did you expect from a socialist sub?
It's a list of banned terms on Chinese internet, I think.

The idea is to block Chinese government shills from accessing this place to comment.

I'm not sure it works though.
Absolutely.
They seem to have shut the system down because they were losing too many accounts, they are probably hoping that making people wait a week or so the cancel their accounts will cause this to blow over.
Pretty damn disgusting to see
Apology? I can't find anything about an apology from Blizzard. Is this true?
Yeah there's similarly not going to be very many NBA fans who will give up all basketball outside of Euro League, BallIsLife, and Drew League.
Not really, Blizzard is following implicit wishes of the Chinese government.
Civil disobedience sure does. Deleting a video game account is not civil disobedience.
I made all my comments I‚Äôm going to make on the matter. Fact is, anyone against Blizzard is wrong. It‚Äôs literally not even a matter of opinion. You can have an opinion on the decision, sure, but Blizzard made the right call. I‚Äôve given enough information to say why. If that‚Äôs not enough, spend some time on Google exploring international relations regarding businesses and the practices of international trade. Blizzard would have lost billions of dollars and millions of players if they didn‚Äôt do what they did.
I do support the protests entirely. However, if I was publicly in a tournament that had a rule against me sharing political views during the competition, I would withhold that information until the tournament concluded.
Well that's seriously fucked. If I hadn't deleted my account after getting locked out it randomly, I'd do it in a heart beat
And fired the presenters.
report you as "bad man" to chicom for when they take over your country
I'm not willing to give them my ID just to delete my account. This is also a completely ridiculous request that given that they state that they need to verify the owner of the email address, which for the purpose of logging in they are happy with a verification link. So the ID thing is an intentional, unnecessary obstacle they put in the way. I'm EU citizen, is there some otherwise binding form of request to delete my data I can create?
Nope, still won't work but I did manage to send a ticket in the "other" section which for some reason stopped asking for authentication regarding account so hopefully they actually process it.
[deleted]
Hmmm...there must be a way to get the message out there to more people!  This is an outrage that cannot stand. Capitalism cannot win over human rights, but capitalism is what they understand so we need to speak to them in their language. But thanks for posting that here!
Pathetic move from a pathetic company.
If it doesnt go through, I'll check in from time to time to see if other methods are active.
Maybe your brain is just on a bit of a delay and you can't understand basic English?
I gladly let them know that I stand against them
nah
I just tried covering sensitive info on my ID for verification like suggested in the comments, and it still didn't work since they never had my ID in the first place. I guess I'll have to wait a few days and try email verification again
Maybe too many people are deleting their accounts
Honestly theres no reason to delete my account. I dont give them money. I rarely play. I know its a political statement but I honestly dont think anything we do here will impact what china does with hong kong.

&#x200B;

It would be like me burning a jersey of a player that leaves a sports team, whats the point?

Nah, unless they walk back the statements and give the guy his prize money there's no going back.

I imagine they're trying to stop the bleeding. Whatever, I'm done. They're on my never again list along with EA.
Maybe don‚Äôt work for a company more interested in sucking CCP cock than keeping US customers then. I‚Äôd be looking for another job yesterday and I hope they are too.
I can't speak for them, but I did follow the instructions and I got the same message. On my very first attempt, it told me I couldn't do it because I had made too many attempts.
Maybe there won't be a nest time
You're the only asshole that I see around here, asshole.
What are you going on about?
It did they same thing for me and i did everything correctly. I think they shut it down so we cant delete our accounts.
Imagine valuing zeros and ones in a computer server more than human rights.
Imagine losing an actual lifestyle you spend your life, your parents life, their parents life (etc) building.
I'm from Hong Kong, all I want to say is every little action people did could add up to become something much larger. Thank you for doing something to stand in solidarity to Hong Kongers.
I just did mine. I didn't even take a second to check my library, or my monetary balance. I just hit that fucking cancel button and never looked back.
Didn‚Äôt take me a second thought. I‚Äôm done with blizzard now, greedy out of touch company with evil undertones. Yeah I‚Äôll pass.
I unsubbed as well, wrote why in the comments
> i wish people would sacrifice just a little to help stand up for what is right

What's being Sacrificed? Instead of throwing your money at a multi billion dollar company, you get to keep your money. There's plenty of other MMOs and RPGs you can invest time in.
Unless Blizzard reverses their actions at the tournament and issue a public apology they will never get my business again. Ever.
I think many are cancelling their subs I spoke with many on gw2 tonight that started playing again bc of this and left wow cancelling their and their spouses accounts and all that. I quit years ago but yea, I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again, FUCK BLIZZ.
Folks in Honk Kong are *currently* dying for these things.

Hey everyone! You know that steam library of unplayed games that you bought on sale? The one you're almost ashamed to think about, since WoW always takes precedent over all these awesome titles? Now's your chance!
I never really got into blizzard games and now I wish I could stop giving them my money but there‚Äôs nothing to stop lol
You have to believe things can change and encourage others that it‚Äôs possible. Be the change you want to see in the world. You can only account for yourself, leading by example is the best way to show people it‚Äôs possible.
People seem to forget about 80 years ago there was some big thing that happened when a world power government began exercising full control over people.  Limiting freedom of speech. Disarmed a populace and had concentration camps. Think it was called a world war or some shit. It's almost like we forgot all the steps that led up to that.
Nothing is going to change. The minuscule amount of people that cancel in the scheme of things wont even register as a blip on their radar. Heck, I'd wouldnt be surprised if they gain more new players from China based on this overall.

Anyhow, those in this and all other subs that are angry at people who dont want to cancel their subs are just as bad people. Do what you want yourself, its your life. Just dont insult people when they dont want to take the same actions as you.
I think if enough players start to leave and delete chars and make it clear that they're losing customers and money it helps. Not much but we can punish blizzard for this. And then we can move onto bigger issues. Wish you Hong kongers the best. Yours sincerely, Chinese dude not living under Chinese rule thankfully
I was addicted to OW lootboxes, no more. Mei stands with Hong Kong.

What is an ocean but an accumulation of tiny drops?
Chuch

Came back for classic, fuck supporting a dictatorship. Cancelled
Idk if you're correcting my spelling or just chiming in that you canceled too, but just in case it's the former, canceled is the correct American spelling and cancelled is British.  Neither spelling is wrong.

Is PvP still trash? I hated that they went from D1‚Äôs Halo style MP to the terrible 3v3 tiny arenas.
The people who do spend money on it need people to play against. The best thing to do is not play at all.
Fuck, we need to make this a meme and post that shit all over the place.
Yeah fair deal having bought right before classic wow. Seems like a lot of other folks have been dropping it to.

LMAOOOO Small world, man. I hope you‚Äôve been well lol.
Oh, I was polite in the tickets. It wasn't until after they refused to delete the account that I started trying to sell it.
Oh shit
Me too! I've been meaning to play NieR beforehand but I'm too busy leveling crafters and gatherers so I can stop being a poor pleb, haha.
There's no time like the present! Shadowbringers was the best expansion pack so far, and Square Enix has like a hundred percent less supporting evil fascists and stuff like that. So far, at least.
Yes,  but potential market is way bigger than US.

Activision-blizzard will adjust to their model of gaming and make new China oriented games
True for current business model and active audiences. Although I‚Äôm very happy that we can strike them where it hurts (money), the reason I deleted my account. But in long run they look at potential of Chinese market, and calculated that it would be more profitable to please communist party to keep growing in China. I think very soon we gonna see huge shift in Blizzard, if I have to guess more toward mobile games.
Ps if you didn‚Äôt catch the message it‚Äôs meant to be a satire copypasta
I‚Äôm glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family‚Äôs organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
Ad-revenue + Active user numbers are great metrics to talk about during  shareholder meetings and possible investors. Which only increases Reddit's worth and thus Tencent gets a bigger amount of dough.
It‚Äôs not turned base. It‚Äôs actually similar to WoW with 2s global cool down abilities. 

If you want action pack, then I‚Äôd say Black Desert Online which is made by Korean Company.


Semi online would be Monster Hunter World. Japanese company.
yikes that's your best comeback?
Discussing the situation and payment now folks. But fuck you for the douche tool comment. I said "I bet you are..." not that you were one no matter the circumstance.
Sure. What's two plus two divided by two?
No you don‚Äôt need a phone. You choose to want it. Sorry I hurt your feelings with truth you little bitch
Dude that‚Äôs the whole point of all this. If a company continues to support China in any way, they‚Äôre guilty of all of China‚Äôs crimes. Same treatment for trump people here. If you support him in any way, you‚Äôre a racist misogynist. 

Why would spending money on any Chinese product make it okay? 

Also, in 2019 you need a phone as much as blizzard; not at all.
You sound... NICE!
People are pissed about the upcoming rdr2 release on pc. Saying it's a money grab since it released on consoles a year ago.
> You guys have principles man.  

FTFY
Yeah I know, it's weird to have things like morals and principals in real life. I know we act like we have them in games and stuff, but if you put your enjoyment of a game in front of the lives of an oppressed people, it's the exact same as saying "who cares? fuck those guys". LPT - This is how you are perceived by people who actually give a fuck about someone other than themselves.
Looks like they‚Äôre already blocking attempts to do this. It wouldn‚Äôt accept my authentication via SMS or my auth app. Only tried it once before it told me ‚Äúdenied, too many attempts.‚Äù
I've been doing that through wow and overwatch by the hour as well
Same here
üëç
How do you do that?
what does the workers have to do with that? leave the little people alone.

It's literally one line of code on a person's account.


If EU, run GDPR request; if else, don't.
[here ya go](https://eu.battle.net/support/en/help/product/services/1327/1329)
I'm getting angrier and more disappointed by the hour tbh. And [accepting more responsibility](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfa55x/hearthstones_twitch_channel_autotimed_me_out_for/f31w798) through complacency, but honestly it's just the hoarder side of me. I'd rather never log in again than delete it all, but yknow what... I'm going to have to.

I hope it ends up being noticeable in their quarterly report/shareprice.
It should work AFAIK
They accepted it but it's all automated so I'm not sure yet.
I tired blacking out everything except name, address, and DOB, they denied it. :(
*You're part of the machine now*
Maybe, maybe not. They don't have my driver's license number or a picture of me. Or height, weight, etc. Things that may not matter but they sure don't need that info.
Player numbers are free advertising, you're worth more to them by playing than you are by not. Plus, if it's a multiplayer game, playing, even without paying, means you're enhancing the experience for other players, and that means they're more likely to pay more. Whales won't swim in an empty pond.
I tried sending the [Mc Lovin id](https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.249184183.1741/mp,550x550,gloss,ffffff,t.3.jpg) and it didn't work
Almost certainly.
I should probably get on a GDPR request while the UK is still in the EU.
Mad. To get them to delete your personal information you have to give them ... personal information
Apparently it‚Äôs to delete personal info they‚Äôve gathered on you. Which is more ironic. To delete personal info they‚Äôve gathered you have to give them ... personal info

In their English statement on the situation they tried to appear neutral and fair. In the Chinese statement they said ‚Äúas always, resolutely safeguard the country‚Äôs dignity.‚Äù sounds like an good ole fashioned bootlicking apology to me.
Boycotting a company that is choosing to support a regime that is actively committing atrocities is a form of protest. If it becomes clear that they have to choose between playing nice with China or playing nice with the rest of the world, the Chinese market is no longer as appealing.
Blizzard banned the protestor so they could protect profits in China. Boycotting them hits exactly what they are trying to protect.
it is a boycott though, and boycotts can also be super effective.
Of course you would say that, Bobby.
So money above all else?
Then the should move to China and stop the sham of being an american company.
Go suck poohs dick
That‚Äôs not what the rule says, did you even read it? It says at blizzards sole discretion anything that could damage the company isn‚Äôt allowed. What he said wasn‚Äôt outrageous or damaging it was a single persons opinion, and that‚Äôs all they had to say to do damage control. Not fuck his prize money and ban him for 12 months. Fuck blizzard, they made their stance abundantly clear.
If you are EU citizen, you can always send an E-Mails to privacy@blizzard.com and demand full deletion of all of your data.

Check out Grim Dawn. It is hands down the best (imo) ARPG on the market at the moment, and nearer to the end of the year it's going to receive its biggest free content patch to date.
No, that's a horrible sentence that's hard to understand.  You also forgot to include any punctuation.  Whoever told you you were good at writing in English was lying to you i'm afraid.  It's call a comma, look it up.
Yah
But they still have to make ends meet. A lot of people arent capable of just quitting a job and making ends meet until they get another one. A lot of people have to work until they find employment. So they are stuck, swallowing their pride and taking crap from people that want to hold them accountable. 

No need to be a dick to em.
You are not alone. I got too many attempts error on the first try.
I'm not deleting my account because I think it's possible that Blizzard turns this around. My subscriptions are cancelled and I'm done playing their games until they make well good on their promise to the players about our voices mattering. That said, it's hard to shit on Blizzard as a whole, it's a massive company with many artists within who are very angry about how their sales and marketing team acted.
I was just saying, the sunk cost makes it harder for someone to delete the account.  That's why unsubscribing isn't enough.
Actually HK was part of China 100 years ago for the Qing dynasty. Technically your grandparents would been part of that, just saying.
The press are trying to make you guys seem like the minority. Don't believe their lies. You have a huge groundswell of support globally. Your side is much larger than it appears on the ground. Don't give up hope.
Thank you. 
I felt that sending blizzard a ticket exposing their shit and getting banned for it was pretty useless by itself, but I did it nevertheless. 

Seeing this make me feel like it was at least something. 
I stand with you
I called my congressman and both senators and let them know the full extent of the censorship and violence going on in Hong Kong and in mainland China. Let them know I wouldn't be supporting companies that support genocides.  

From Texas, with love. I'd send y'all my shotgun and a pallet of ammo if it wouldn't get stopped in customs. Stay strong.
i hope you win this fight, i cant imagine what it would be like if i were in your shoes and i hope it never comes to that. partially why fighting for you now is so important. we are all human and we deserive basic rights. i just wish america wasnt so corrupt and would help you stop chinas regime
good my man, the games used to be good. especially when it was blizzard north but the real raeson youve stayed is most likely the community. i hope you find a tight knit grp to have fun with again on a different game! :D

even if blizz falls all its games will be replaced. wow crashing would mean a surge of people making mmorpgs to try and take that spot. so you might even end up with a better mmorpg than wow when its all said and done who knows. 

but know this, youre standing up for whats right
Nuked my account just a minute ago as well. Did they remove option to give reason for removing blizzard account because I couldn't find it
blizz has been like that for awhile now. their first thought when making a game isnt how can we make this game great but how can we nickel and dime people with this game
Another one here. Maybe if enough people do it they might sit up and take notice.
Moon‚Äôs Haunted man
You shouldn't ever give them business again anyway because all they'd be doing is what helps their bottom line AGAIN.  They'd only be responding to public backlash.  Not because it's the right thing to do.
I've been boycotting Blizzard for months now just because of the state of that company. This is just the final nail in the coffin that I will never return to a blizzard game. I have been playing ESO for a while and it seems old wow subscribers are transitioning here as well. WE WELCOME ALL WITH OPEN ARMS! Come play ESO!
Cancelled mine with Free Hong Kong as part of the comment.

I'm hoping Blizzard makes this right.  I'd like to go back.
I was putting off Code Vain and Surge 2. Back to the Souls-likes!
Canceling a WoW subscription will do nothing to help HK people gain human rights. It *might* help Blizzard not be assholes and pull bullshit stunts like this, but it‚Äôs not gonna do shit for HK. Honestly I‚Äôm not sure what can be done as a US (or any other country that‚Äôs not HK) citizen other than spread info. Even then, what specifically does that do to help? More people know about it... now what? Don‚Äôt buy shit that says ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù? I‚Äôm genuinely wondering exactly what we should be doing.
[deleted]
Seriously, the virtue signalling is insane. Cancelled my account with ultra rare stuff and a billion gold and a huge bnet balance, didn't even think twice, karma plz!!
It's also largely meaningless when that motivation can be utilized for real good
Indeed.
If I was correcting you I would have wrote cancelled*
I find [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIOfeMelgSA) video sums it up quite well :-)
Couldn't tell you, i'm more of a PvE guy myself, but there are [more modes](https://d2.destinygamewiki.com/wiki/Crucible_Modes) than the one you describe.
You could also only play as Mei (a symbol of pro Hong Kong). A solution to helping stop Blizzard is to only play with your friends who are pro Hong-Kong, this way you are not contributing to Blizzard. If you do so, you should not help Blizzard in any significant way, while causing higher power bills for Blizzard.

Your suggestion is also good; simply don't play, without deleting your account, the cost to Blizzard is the same.
I can already picture the Drake version of the meme
Im so happy for you! Congrats. 

Yea, i imagine this will RUIN or possibly kill the company. Im eager to see how it all pans out
thank you
You too kind stranger that I actually know lol
Lmao

I admit I was going to start playing WoW Classic when I can, but I've completely abandoned that plan now because of this.

For FF14, I assume I have to go through all the previous expansions content to get to the good stuff that you mentioned?
I don't think they expected the reaction they got from this.  There's lots they could have done differently to mitigate the damage if that was the case.  Heck, not firing the two guys who were doing the interview, had no control over what the player said, and were clearly uncomfortable because they knew how it would be seen, would have been a huge step in the right direction.  The problem is that the optics make this out to be a really heavy handed and authoritarian approach.  Just fire everyone regardless of the culpability.  It's not something that really resonates with people, while in contrast, the freedom for Hong Kong movement gets a ton of sympathy because they've had epic level protests with almost no violence (aside from what the police are doing to protestors).  They dun goofed on this one.
Well since the copypasta just started today, there would be no way of me knowing its copypasta lol

You're so edgy man, how does that work for you?
3!
You didnt hurt my feelings but please try and go without a phone see how far that gets you. Some of us have jobs that require it. I know you're just a lonely troll that needs projection, but like I said, I'm not your mom, so I dont give a shit about your insecurities.
Yeah okay go try a sales job without a phone.
Wait they're pissed it's coming out on PC? I get being annoyed that it didn't release at the same time, but would they rather it didn't come out on PC at all...?
They're pissed about the EGS exclusive business. It was always assumed that it would come to PC eventually just like GTAV
Those people are fucking morons. 

Some of us can't really afford a console, AND a PC. So RDR2 coming to PC is exciting to me.
Did the first one ever come to PC? I know it's probably more for the online than single player but if the story is good I'd like to play them in order
Imagine the amazing mods that will come out that will Be better than the OG version. Just like Skyrim
Good - means their site is melting down.
yeah ... its really nice that my authenticator and sms authentication are denied ... so iam not able to delete my account ...
Can we file complaints that they're blocking requests?
Nah i had that a couple of days ago it has absolutely nothing to do with this situation,

There site is just scuffed
I seriously doubt they'd block it since they'd either pay a 20 million euro fine, OR 4% of their global gross revenue whichever is the higher value.

4% for Blizzard is a veritable shitton of money, no companies fuck with GDPR.
Got the same thing. They requested a photo of my ID to verify.
You can‚Äôt ‚Äúblock‚Äù a Subject Access Request. - They HAVE to do it.
I wasn't allowed to delete my ahit either.
I got the same thing, wich is pretty sad , blocking people from leaving you, they trully did embrace china :'D
You can then turn to an customer protection association and file a report for not complying to GDPR. Your claim was legitimate.
same https://i.imgur.com/wzXe3pa.jpg
No they dont have to keep that in mind, this was just simply easier
From what I understand, it's not that easy because GDPR applies to all EU citizens no matter where they are or whether or not they made the account in the EU. It's more cost effective to treat everyone as an EU citizen.
> battle.net 

still asks me for an image of my ID
Alright I‚Äôll try that.
Sure, but if you were worried about Blizzard knowing who you are, they could find you in a half second with that other info.

But that being said, I probably would have done the same thing.
Eh, not really.. Probably better than dealing with situations where someone is hacked and hacker deletes the account.
[Reduced to atoms](https://imgflip.com/i/3cqqy4)
It's still funny tho
VPN doesn't protect you from Chinese spyware
Vpns don't work in China
And that helps Hong Kong how? All it does is hurt Blizzard. That's fine if that's all you want to do. Civil disobedience it is not.
Do you guys not understand that China makes half your shit? 

Phone/PC components, shoes, your clothes were probably made by a 12 year old in a sweatshop. IN CHINA.
On top of all this drama signal boosting the guy who made the statement originally. This is probably the absolute best outcome that the hearthstone player could have ever hoped for.
I've read the entirety of Hearthstone eSports tournament rules which you can find on Hearthstone's websites. Regarding the specific rule quoted, don't be conceded in thinking this is an American/European issue. It's a Hong Kong issue, at a tournament in Hong Kong, where a player explicitly came out supporting a protest against the country via a game sponsored by Blizzard. Blizzard can easily be for the protests, but they're not based out of Hong Kong. It's best for any company to keep good relations with a country they do business in.

The alternative you all (unknowingly) are asking for is that Blizzard no longer associates with Hong Kong, and should remove all games/services from that country. Sorry, that would be stupid for business. And sure, pulling those services might be a good "stand" against Hong Kong, except now they're depriving tons of people in that country from playing games that may want to be playing it.

This is a hell of a lot more about the eSports rule than anyone is willing to look into. There's local laws. There's international laws. There's local relations. There's international relations. You have no right to ask a company like Blizzard to act a certain way unless you understand the entirety of what that decision means. Hence why Blizzard is where they're at with success. They're not stupid. What Blizzard did would be recommended by any intelligent business owner/chair for a company that is even remotely large.
I am on New Zealand but I will still try contacting them through that, thank you.

Actually I had to stop at 4th grade due to almost dying everytime I went to school and my family couldn't afford home school so I have an excuse friend no one told me I was good at English I just try my best to make it understandable
No need to call people cancelling their accounts assholes either.

Likely because the server is overwhelmed and returning 504 errors which happen to be the same error they chose for rate limiting individuals.
But Qing Dynasty is not the same as PRC, especially in the context of life style.
The gamer didn't ask for independence. He asked for revolution over the political system. However, CCP denounces every protest in HK as damaging its sovereignty. Basically, CCP is a tyranny.
I am thinking that it's less important that what you did could be pretty useless, but you did spent some of your time to speak out. You are making an effort to show that you actually value the thing that you are actively voicing put for - that's what matters.
agreed, fighting an invisible fight can be hard sometimes. but just know every action truly helps them. hopefully this spark of revolution can help give chinese democracy that much sooner and stop that many more beatings and deaths.
There's actually a [bill](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Human_Rights_and_Democracy_Act) that would help immensely going through US congress next week, please make sure that your representatives will be voting yes for the bill. I'm really thankful for your support.
I don‚Äôt even care about the quality of the game, I was loving classic. People used to say give me liberty or give me death. I can at least say give me liberty or cancel my goddamn wow subscription and I‚Äôm never giving you another dime.
Unsubbed from WOW about 2 months ago. Uninstalled all my Blizz games and launcher after their shitty move yesterday.
Even had a Tyrael wallpaper....Got rid of it too.

It seems like for the last 2 years blizzard has been making a shit Sundae. Yesterday was the cherry on top for me.

Oh, how the mighty have fallen. Bye Blizzard
Yep, but unfortunately the general masses are seemingly blind to corruption. Unfortunately I think this will blow over, and things will be back to normal in a month but I‚Äôm proud that I will never touch a blizzard product again so I‚Äôm doing my part.
Since activision bought them and the director at blizz left. Its not the same company anymore
Right, but if we punish them for bad behaviour, and then punish them further for good behaviour, what's their incentive to not do the bad shit?
I just can‚Äôt at this point. They‚Äôve annoyed me for years supporting the Red Cross with their pet sales and such and now this.

Idk. I feel like even if they apologize and try to make this right it‚Äôs like when you‚Äôre cheated on, it‚Äôs morally fucked up and hard to stay with that person right? I mean blizz has shown their true colors here.

Like, they lost trust here especially when it‚Äôs so clear what the right choice would have been here.
[deleted]
Blizzard never stated they were against the Hong Kong protestors. Get your head out of your ass and don't be stupid to see this ban as anything related to support/non-support.
..and next month everybody comes to their senses and complains on how they want their account back.
Let's put it this way then:

There is a clear right choice and a clear wrong choice for those who believe themselves to be "informed consumers"
I went to D2 and never look back at OW.
Huh. It looks like they might have expanded it. Thanks, I'll have to check it out. I'm more of a PvE guy too, but Destiny 1 had such fantastic PvP, and D2 was such a massive downgrade that I quit the entire game within a few days of launch. Even if it still sucks, I guess I'll have plenty of PvE stuff that I skipped out on.
It wont, lol.
Yeah, I might take the weekend before the raid to play it!
You do, but if you left at level 50 it won't take too long to catch up. Post-ARR can be a bit of a drag, but Heavensward (and the Post-Heavensward) content is fantastic. Then there's Stormblood, which is pretty good but not quite Heavensward-levels. Then you get through a little Post-Stormblood content and you get to Shadowbringers which is just fantastic in every way. Depending on how much you play, you can pretty much do HW and Stormblood in a weekend apiece. It's a bit of a time investment to be sure, but once you get out of A Realm Reborn it gets significantly less grindy!
Used to play FFXI, and Wow, but started XIV last month.  Already at level 60 and past the original story.  It goes quickly, but is hugely enjoyable from a story perspective.  First time I really felt that from a story in an MMO.
Indeed they goofed on this one. And of course as company they want all the money they can get, I‚Äôm sure they would love to keep all US and EU in addition of having China. But they showed who had higher priority. 

They had to react fast, hard and harsh to show to overloads who is loyal.
:P Now spread the word young padawan, fuck bliizzard for condemning human rights
You still remain an active user like all the others complaining here :)
Actually feeling pretty good tbh, don't know how cancelling your wow sub works for you despite being so hyped for the upcoming patch. I mean it takes a lot of courage to do that right, you're a real hero give yourself a pat on the back.
CORRECT. But you're not op so you win nothing. soz
And now you‚Äôve moved the goalposts. You didn‚Äôt say anything about a sales job. You just said 2019. 

Also, door to door salesmen don‚Äôt need phones. Floor salesmen don‚Äôt need phones. So even with your fallacy, you‚Äôre just wrong.

You can‚Äôt even win by cheating.
Yeah, some people are. Doesn't make sense to me.
People are upset about exclusivity deals.  It hurts consumers in exchange for cash.

I get why you disagree, but I can see why people want to watchdog that kind of corporate misbehavior.
Rockstar has a track record of releasing half assed PC ports then never fixing the bugs. And really aggressive monetization.
They're not pissed because it's coming out on PC, they are pissed because they know Rockstar released it on PS4 saying no PC port confirmed, so they get the money for PS4 and PC versions.
I feel like it's probably the people who bought it on console already and would've bought it on PC back then instead if they had the option, and now they have to buy the game twice to get it on their platform of choice, not to mention their progress/achievements all being useless if they do switch to PC. 

I kinda get it, but, I also think there's more important things in life to be upset about.
I can see a few reasons to be pissed.

First off

> It's coming to PC at all.

Ok, that's great. Neato.

However, I have some critique about the journey.

1. It didn't release at the same damn time like it fucking should have.

2. Releasing late after calling it a console exclusive means that close to the maximum number of people possible will have caved and bought consoles specifically for this game, or bought it on console despite preferring PC when possible.

3. Due to point 2, they will likely get some duplicate sales. Maybe a lot.

4. Despite being a fucking semi-dated game at this point that I'd expect to pick up at 50% off, I fully expect it to be a 60$ or so for the next year.

5. I hate to go all conspiracy theorist, but this screams backroom temporary exclusivity deal that was planned like this from day 1 to fuck over consumers the maximum amount.


Also I'm super skeptical the port will be a decent port but we'll have to wait and see on that. I guess I'm a pessimist.
They‚Äôre pissed because there was things suggesting that RDR2 would not come to PC, which was either ‚Äòconfirmed‚Äô or never cleared up. This forces players to purchase on a console. 

Now here it comes on PC with most likely better support and all the advantages of PC, some year or so later. They have every right to be pissed. 

I personally work with someone, strictly a PC player, who bought an Xbox one *__just__* to play RDR2
The rockstar launcher store doesn't work. It also gives your information to third parties. The game will not be available on Steam until Christmas. 

Bit shitty, but nothing in comparison.
I would love to wait 1,5 years more like we had to with GTA5... but for real, I think most people are pissed because Rockstar wants you to buy in on the Rockstar launcher so they get the full money and don't have to share it with Steam, which I have no problem with, but some people just want all their things on steam, which I also kinda understand...
Oh yeah I could see that. I prefer steam as well, but I downloaded the launcher anyway. It's not that big of a deal. Blizzard has their own launcher too.
> They're pissed about the EGS exclusive business

Isn't it being released on Steam in Dec? Oh no, a minor inconvenience.
Yeah ditto.
They're not mad that it's coming to PC. They're mad that R\* originally said it *wasn't* coming to PC. So all of those people who would've preferred to wait for the PC version bought it for console, and now R\* reveals that they were lying through their teeth to milk both markets dry. So all of those console players that want it for PC now have to buy the game a 2nd time and essentially kiss their progress and achievements goodbye, all because R\* fed them a crock of shit to maximize their profits.

I'm not even a console player, but I can certainly understand the frustration of people in that position.
It did not. Too complicated for them to transfer from what I read.
Screenshot it. It is breach of GDPR.
Yes. The easiest way is to turn to the privacy protection institution of your country (for France : CNIL) or more efficiently turn to an association specialized in customers' rights protection (for France the most well known is "UFC Que choisir") and they'll add the report to the piles they already have.

The more volume they have, the better.
If they're blocking legit gdpr requests then they'll get even more shit for sure. The EU would jump on that. It'll be interesting to see what comes of this if true.
4% of global gross?  You don't say...

&#x200B;

Well, that just sounds like a goal for us, now doesn't it??
Yeah definitely don‚Äôt want them having a picture of my ID on file, it‚Äôs the one piece of info identity thieves haven‚Äôt been able to get their hands on
Yeah I sent them an image of my US ID. Just got an email back saying that they didn't accept it because I'd blacked out my driver's license ID number, so I dunno if they would have eventually accepted it if it were unaltered.
You mean his name and address?  They already know that for the vast majority of us dude.  It's part of the billing process.
Yeah but why make it easier for them?

Did you see the NBA? Similar scandal, at first licking the boots of China. Came around in less than 24 hours, all they had to do: "regardless of whether we agree with the statement the general management made, we support his right to say it. The NBA firmly stands on the side of free speech, and not limiting any players, coaches, etc in that right" (i'm paraphrasing).

Just for saying that, now the NBA is banned in China, and China has responded that they don't consider support for hong kong free speech because it goes against "social stability". It shows the NBA, while willing to be amicable with China, will not be in it's back pocket and will not censor it's own major players to do so.
Yeah, I mean it isn't like this whole fiasco hasn't been all over the news now for the last few days, opening thousands of peoples eyes to the plight in hong kong and to just how evil china is.
I know where everything I buy comes from, and where most of their components are sourced from. I buy very sparsely from China, but I also don't buy that much anymore because I'm at a point in my life where I am trying to get rid of crap and I don't need a bunch of new stuff.
Do you not understand if you previously got 90% of your stuff from China, and now managed to cut that number down to 80%, then China gets 10% less from you? Now imagine thousands, even millions, of other people doing the same. It doesn't need to be all or nothing to have a positive effect.
That was a really long winded explanation for ‚Äòwhen playing and doing tournaments in China, you have to follow China‚Äôs rules‚Äô no shit mate. Everyone here is well aware of that, the problem being the Chinese rules are authoritarian and don‚Äôt allow free speech without punishing people with imprisonment/re-education (torture)/or death.  So yes we do have a big fucking problem with blizzard going along with these rules.
"that would be stupid for business"

That's what everyone is upset about. People in Hong Kong are putting their lives on the line for freedom, and a company chooses profits over democracy.
My guess? Their text message service is overloaded. Try tomorrow. Because we need to show them we're not just going to calm down tomorrow and forget about this. Eyes on Hong Kong keep the pro democracy people alive. Blizzard told us they will try to keep our attention away from the people of the City because mainland China wants them too. An Entertainment company trying to keep us unaware of the pracarity of lives who want to keep their voice. Nope. They are telling me i need to send my GOVERNMENT ID to them to verify my account.  Not happening. They got my phone #. If that shit isn't working by tomorrow I will be digging to find a number to directly call.
i wish this was higher up. we need to get that bill passed

right lol, unreal... cant even join in on an effort and boycott a single thing for a month. thats pathetic. some people have zero backbone and all selfishness
I want no DEMAND bli$$ard be moved to China. No warning just nope go to china or face financial oblivion
Seems like redemption is out the window, could send a message to other companies to not even TRY these kind of stunts without thinking long and hard about it.
Yep, if you eat meat you can't support human rights. You're a genius.
Wow you must be the smartest guy ever!
You may have read the English press release from blizzard. Did you read the Chinese one? 

‚Äúas always, resolutely safeguard the country‚Äôs dignity.‚Äù

Sound like theyre actively taking a side against the protests to me.
Morally you do what you feel you need.   It won't have much of an impact though unfortunately. I want it to, trust me. But the realistic expectation is actual change does not come from the absence of support for a company, but from active engagement in politics
Yup, and something like 75% of that stuff is completely F2P these days too. :P
Yeah, even with the fallout there are too many die hard fans and people who won't assume a small action on their part will make any difference so they will take inaction instead, and blizzard will go forward making money as usual.
Thanks! I'll definitely start playing it when I have the time :) No more regrets. Funny how much my mind and views have changed only because of actions of Blizzard.
I'm not sure if this is genuine, but it doesnt work for me, but blizzard is a luxury not a necessity so kts not gonna suck that much. At least I'm lucky enough to have been born where I was
Fuck can I at least get a high five
You are trying way to hard at this, I'm playing games while typing so sorry my debating isnt lock right. I just said I cancelled my subscription when I really enjoyed the game and all you decided to trying and fight me on it. If you dont agree that's fine, I'm not trying to "win" at anything other than my game right now. And the fact that you feel like you can win at an internet argument is laughable. Chill out and go enjoy your night. It's not worth you or me having an aneurism over
Explain any logical reason to deny fans a game for however long on all systems when ymthey were going ti release it anyways.

Ill wait..
I'm glad to see the game come to PC, but to delay the release by a year was purely a money-making decision. So, it's entirely understandable some people might be upset by a practice that is intended to make Rockstar more money, and not really benefit the player in any way. Although it certainly is far from being the most egregious example of a games company making choices purely for greater profits at the player's expense (remember the whole lootbox fiasco with EA and Starwars: Battlefront?).
That makes sense. Rockstar is certainly one of bigger money-grubbing videogame entities out there. 

As someone who has played a fair amount of GTA5 on PC, I guess I just thought that the delayed PC release for that game was because they were trying to shore up security vs hackers (and failed miserably at it). And that assumption followed over to RDR2. Thx for explaining.
it's bringing an atmosphere that has been relegated strictly to consoles. freedom of choice is a big reason why we have PCs. consoles you know that you're not getting halo on ps4, and not getting god of war of xbox. their platform is built around exclusives because the consoles are money losses that make back many times over on the games.

egs exclusivity agreements help no one except for epic.
idk, i haven't really been following it, i just saw the fuck epic people talking about how they were super mad about it
I would comply and censor everything that can't possibly be used by them to identify myself, so everything (including the picture) except for my name, birthday and address. If they asked for an uncensored picture, they are going to have to explain themselves
Yes but I think what they're saying is that if they have your name, address and DoB they can probably find all of the other info pretty quickly if they really wanted to.
As if a virus scanner can stop the Chinese government.
Dawg... Look up the great Chinese firewall
>Now imagine thousands, even millions, of other people doing the same.

Nope, not seeing that happening at all.
Okay but again, you clearly don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on at all. Quit associating with Blizzard. Doesn‚Äôt affect any of us still playing or Blizzard at all. You can think you and the mass of people on Reddit threatening to quit does, but it doesn‚Äôt. Not to mention most of you won‚Äôt actually quit anyway. 

Takes your selfish problems somewhere else and stop pretending to understand international business problems.
For me personally, it's more _addiction_ than selfishness.
Damn, this guy went off lol. Took it to the extreme; I was only trying to say that while it is good to no longer support a company that reacts like this to people **TRYING TO GAIN HUMAN RIGHTS**, it‚Äôs not doing anything to actually help them. There are definitely other things that *might* have an impact. Let me remind everyone that Blizzard is an American company. While they undoubtedly have ties with China, it‚Äôs not like Blizz has any sort of sway in their political actions.
You do realise that cancelling your wow sub makes 0 difference right? Whether it's just to take a stance or to sabotage them, whatever the reason most people who partake in this #BoycotBlizzard shitfest will start playing and paying for their games again along with the majority who kept playing, they will get their revenue, they won't be moved by your actions nor will they be moved by all the actions as a whole. The flow of money will keep on coming in and in the end that's all that matters to them. Might as well just keep on playing if you enjoy it that much
üå≤üçÄ5üçÄüå≤
I'm not a software developer... But my understanding of games developed for different platforms is that it takes time to code the game in these different platforms. Then they have to compile, qa, remove bugs, alpha test, beta test, plan for worldwide release, etc. It's the same reason game companies don't always release on Mac at the same time as windows or Android the same time as IOS.

Rockstar has always primarily been a console developer, so it likely takes them a while to recreate the game for PC.
Coding, testing, bug fixing for starters. 

Are you a dev?
Whats the difference between waiting a year and selling it during release? Either way you have to buy it on console and pc.
Nah, they get to cash a huge check for not releasing it to PC players for 12 months. Have a good day.
I think you greatly underestimate the resentment people from all over the world have towards China. It's certainly already happening.  
  
But regardless of whether you believe it or not, then it's worth noting that even if just a single person did it, then it would still have a positive effect.
My selfish problems? Tell that to the people of Hong Kong getting their asses beat by Hong Kong police you fucking prick. Educate yourself on what‚Äôs happening over there and in mainland China. I don‚Äôt need to understand international business problems to know that what blizzard did was a slap in the face to everyone fighting for their freedom to talk shit about the CCP without getting disappeared. Or hey just keep up with your big brain obvious as fuck lectures on surface level international business relations üòÇ


And again, no shit most of us realize individually we won‚Äôt make a difference to blizzards bottom line, and they‚Äôve made it obvious they‚Äôd rather have mainland China‚Äôs money anyway with their recent actions so who cares. We‚Äôre doing it to make ourselves feel better about not helping blizzards decline into shit games that pander to countries with unapologetically shit human rights records. They‚Äôve made their choice I hope it goes as well as all the other American companies that tried to setup shop there, got their IP stolen, then got kicked out on their asses.
Dont understand why it outrages so many people. I dont want to invest money in it anyways. So even if it doesn't affect the company, I did it anyways. But guess what, it did something since blizzard backed off! Crazy what your definition of 0 difference is.
I know you're trying to see the best in the world but trust me, Rockstar ain't the place to start.

And they were developing on PC way before consoles.

And there's no reason why they seem to be the only company with the inability to release on all platforms at once when there's a lack of exclusivity deals in play with platform manufacturers / various storefronts.

And really they're just some fucking company why defend them? Do you defend and shield your mechanic when your car is still broken or do you raise attention to the issue so it can be properly fixed? They owe you nothing, you owe them nothing. Fuck them.
I am, in fact, a software engineer ... but you don't have to know the first thing about how software is actually developed and deployed to notice that Rockstar is just about the only AAA studio/publisher suffering from this mysterious problem in which the PC versions of their new games are delayed by years.

The fact is that the tooling is good enough these days, and the architectures of consoles and PCs similar enough, that ports do not require the effort they once did. Whether it's unbelievable technical incompetence or (much more likely) simple greed, there's no excuse for how Rockstar handles their PC ports.
Basically forces players to buy it on one platform, then when it comes out on PC, they buy it there as well. More money for Rockstar and console manufacturers.
‚ÄúJust keep up with your big brain obvious as fuck lectures on surface level international business relations‚Äù

Holy shit you might of just killed him.
Yes because as a company they have to keep on having a good face for the public, hence why they backed off, in time all this will cool down, blizzard will get their money and lots of people will be playing their games and giving them money. You might have 'made a difference' at this moment but in the bigger picture you did jack shit, life goes on, most of the people will forget and blizzard will be well off despite what happened, so yea practically 0 difference but hey enjoy your brief time of glory
I guess I just don't see what the issue is. It sucks for me having to wait a year, but I don't play consoles anyway so I just had to wait.
> I am, in fact, a software engineer 

Found the Full Sail drop out. 

> and the architectures of consoles and PCs similar enough 

Sure, they're both on x86, but the hardware is vastly different on PC. 

I missed the part where you have worked on any AAA title and know first hand internal procedures such as team composition and project management. 

Have you ever noticed that Rockstar's PC ports generally come with better performance and less overall game breaking bugs? It's almost like they focus on quality over quantity.
Wasn't Monster Hunter World released on PC like 7 or 8 months after console? I take it Capcom is another one of these companies with that "mysterious problem"?
Ok? What's the difference if they released them at the same time? You would still have to buy the game on both platforms.
Cool and I'm okay with life moving on, I'm just not investing my money into that. See heres the difference, in the grand scheme of things both of these comments wont matter in the big picture, but at least I did something. You stand for jack shit, and are morally shallow. And life will go on, and I will forget about you, and you will forget about me. So are we done with this extremely dense philosophical pissing contest, or do you need to feed your ego anymore?
No one said you have to care about poor business practices, they are just explaining that these are poor business practices and why. The fact that you don't care doesn't give you the right or the authority to dismiss the their claims, and that kind of mindset is hugely problematic on a much larger scale in my opinion.

When someone tells you that they have suffered, it is not your place to dismiss that claim without regard. Suffering is relative. Empathy is universal.
You are a delusional and ignorant child, and everybody knows it but you.

Sorry. :(
Gta 5 made over 4 billion dollars. They have the money to make it all at once. Also where's the anti cheat on gta online.
In their case I'd be more likely to suspect the "unbelievable technical incompetence" I mentioned, but who knows.

It's not like it's *no* work. In fact, given how much larger the scale of AAA game software is these days, in simple man hours it's probably generally more work to execute a port of the same code for a modern AAA game to a different platform than it was back in the day when they would often completely rewrite the game (e.g. Doom 64). But, budgets today have grown proportional to the scale of the projects (obviously), and the vast majority of cross-platform releases these days make it clear that this is a solved problem, even for proprietary engines and tooling known for being relatively immature. For instance, Destiny 2 saw a relatively short delay before its PC release, under two months. IIRC that port was handled by another studio.

So, who really knows in Rockstar's case (or Capcom's) if it's greed or incompetence or simply a lack of anything resembling urgency, but it really has to be one of those three things.
Well you did say you were wondering why it outrages so many people so I explained myself, that's all I did. And hey at least I'm still having fun playing their game and you aren't :)
Get off your fucking high horse. It's a video game. Nobody is suffering. Either way, I didn't say I don't care. I just don't understand why it is an issue. You don't work for Rockstar and don't know their development or staffing capabilities. Would you have rather waited a year to get the game on all 3 platforms instead? Is that fair for the console gamers to wait a year for Rockstar to finish developing it on PC?
Ah, look, another narcissistic ass hat speaking from a false sense of authority on the internet. How original.
Cool man, at least I dont support a communist regime.
Them waiting to release rdr2 on PC is a tactic that they used to get people to double dip on the game. They also did it with GTA:V. They absolutely were able to release both games with the console version.
> Nobody is suffering.

You're demonstrating that lack of empathy that  I was talking about.
Yes, *I'm* the "narcissistic ass hat speaking from a false sense of authority on the internet."

üôÑ
Good for you
Ok? What's the difference if they released them at the same time? You would still have to buy the game on both platforms.
Please explain how people are suffering. I could use a laugh today.
Yes, that is what I said.
Why do you say that? You would just buy it on the better platform.
I'm not a dog, I don't do tricks on command. Enjoy your day.
Yes, it is. Good job buddy!
Exactly... So if they came out at the same time, I would buy it once. If it comes out 1 year later on PC, I would still only buy it once (on whatever platform). I'm a PC player so I am only buying it once. Why would I need to buy it on PC if I am a console player?

Even if they came out at the same time, buying the game on 1 platform doesn't mean that I get a free copy on the other. It probably should be, but no gaming company does that. I have Diablo 3 on PC. Don't have a free copy for any console.
Oh I see. You backed yourself into an impossible position so you are gracefully conceding. Thanks, you too!
No, I should be congratulating you! You have mastered that ctrl-v, ctrl-c, AND ctrl-i. So proud!
Because real fans of the series want to play it as soon as possible, so they buy the worse game on a console.
lol nice try but whatever makes you feel better.
I'm flattered that you like my insults enough to use them yourself, but you probably want to wait a little while first. Otherwise it just makes things awkward.

Honestly, I'm surprised a master of the art of self-awareness such as yourself doesn't know that.
Why is it worse? Don't they do updates on consoles?
If you are unable to explain your position, you are effectively conceding. GG.
Oh, silly me. I didn't realize you had a copyright on sarcasm. I'll try to do better. 

But wait! What is this? You used a "mastery of a skill" reference in almost the same way I did.

Your hypocrisy knows no bounds!
Worse platform, have to pay a subscription to play online, capped fps and lower quality, the common console downsides.
> I didn't realize you had a copyright on sarcasm

Funny you mention that‚Äîbased on the evidence assembled here, you don't seem to know what sarcasm *is*.

Or maybe your detector just needs tuning, or your general reading comprehension skills need some development? Or perhaps you are trying to save face by being deliberately obtuse? Regardless, it's not a good look.
Interesting. Thanks!
Also something to note, they never said that they would be releasing RDR2  or GTA:V until later, basically tricking their customers into double dipping.

What happened to Mei‚Äôs eye
[deleted]
This is the best art I've seen so far of Mei supporting Hong Kong protesters. 

Snowball is pretty cute.
Would be better if her clothes were black. Black is the unofficial colour of the protesters. Red usually signifies support for China and the CCP. Most HK protests flags have the same flag but coloured in black and a white flower with no Chinese stars.

Because for the Hong Konger, that symbolize the government who's doing China's bidding.

It's in reference to the young protester who was shot in the face with a beanbag round, causing her goggles to shatter and injure her eye. It's since become a symbol of defiance against the HK police's brutal anti-protest tactics.

It‚Äôs [referencing the injury that a reporter sustained from a police fired rubber bullet](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-china-49910636)
It's a reference to the shit the HK police have been pulling; shooting out protesters' eyes. Not just protesters, but also reporters who aren't from Russian Propaganda company RT. RT reporters are treated as royalty. Anyone else gets tear gassed or worse.

Fuck the Hong Kong Police. And fuck mainland China. Glory to Hong Kong!
it was shot out by Chinese polize
To add to this, there are humanitarian laws when using fire arms, live rounds and non lethals like rubber bullets or bean bag rounds. Hong Kong police , which has been replaced by mainland Chinese forcers basically ignore all of these rules of engagements and just beat people with reckless abandon. 

When firing non Lethal rounds you're supposed to aim at the lower body/stomach area, NOT the head for precisely reasons described above. It's been shown time and time again they don't care.

There are 1.7 million members - MEMBERS - in the protest against China.
That is not talking about the people who donate to the protest, people who are following the protest, or people who support the protest. 1.7 million members. And the police are order to fire bean bags, from there guns, through masked protesters. When the bag hits the mask, the mask shatters and the glass goes in the eyes of the victims, and so too does the bean bag.

No, governments come and go with the wind. I'm talking "China" here, a name that's endured for millennia. You still call the land China right? The same China that's held Hong Kong for said millennia. The United States is on it's second government, France is on it's fifth. The government is not the civilization.

>Because some people use games as an escape 

Cool. But video games are an art form. Politics is inescapable in creative mediums.


>and some ignorant people don‚Äôt understand that threatening an AMERICAN company does not resolve the Chinese issues

That's... not what's happening.

They want the American company to stop supporting Chinese authoritarianism. Obviously that wont magically stop the problem in China. The issue is these people don't feel comfortable supporting a company that doesn't support human rights. This is just the free market at work, lol

That's actually not accurate. Sadly, I just downvoted your comment.

## FAQ
 
### What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment‚Äîand Reddit account‚Äîhas decreased by one.
 
### Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Espousing regressive ideologies:
 * Religion or the existence of gods, astrology, numerology, ghost belief, and other super-natural excesses
 * Bigotry, including racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-immigration, Islamophobia, and gender binary
 * Right-wing "Chud" policies such as Voter IDs, privilege denial, pro-murder-toys, "freeze peaches", flat tax rate, anti-choice misogyny, and supporting the violent insurgency in Hong Kong
* Too much focus on children's entertainment, such as Fortnite or Cartoon Network,
* An otherwise incorrect or non-valid opinion,
* Spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors or missteps,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
### Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No‚Äî*not yet*. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
### I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
### How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
smart move
This?

No it is not true. they claim there are 1.7 million people did the protest. But this number is puffed. HK's street is very narrow. there is no chance to put 1.7 M in the protesting area.

Let me tell you, these protesters claimed they had a very successful protest in Shatin, which is right under my apartment, and 200K people joined the activity. what i saw, is they had less people than the Stand charted marathon  start up place. which is around 20k to 30k people. i am the volunteer of th marathon so i am quite clear about the No. of people.  so the so called 1.7M people I guess should be around 170K. to 340K.

another rumor these people liked to share is police officers killed them.  so far they could not show any solid ground to support them.

more interesting thing is, they also claim the local policemen raped them. which i dont know how these people can believe in such ridiculous rumors.

HK need to fight for freedom. but not in this way. currently these protesters are not fighting the goverment, not attacking the communism party, but crackdown train stations, burn restaurants, cafes and banks in residence area. will the evil Xi jingping in these places? is Carrie Lam lived in these places? go attack them. not us!
Finally, someone willing to defend Chinese pride! Thank you for expressing the truth on Hong Kong‚Äôs inviolable Chinese identity.


We have deposited 50 social credit points to your account, and you have earned the privilege to receive organ donations from our generous Hong Kong residents and Falun Gong practitioners.
If you‚Äôre talking about the United States, actually yeah they can. They‚Äôd just need to get voters on board with it all.
Minecraft is a game that is spreading the views of needing to go back to our roots and become hunter-gatherers again. Undoubtably a game that defies the modern society we live in today; very political
You're obviously a state-sponsored account. Your entire profile looks fake.
Wait, maybe I‚Äôm mis-reading your post, but are you saying ‚Äúsupporting the violent insurgency in Hong Kong‚Äù is a reason you‚Äôre downvoting? Please clarify, because it‚Äôs important to be clear on this issue in this thread in particular
Considering blizzard employees did a walk-out in support of HK, this could be coming from *inside the house!*
yeah
I agree, other than 50 cents nothing is true
Wait, can anyone get social points? Can someone who doesn‚Äôt live in China get social points?
If so, that is neat.

Also, yes. A USA state can leave the USA. The USA supports freedom above all else.

Freedom of Speech

Freedom of Religion

Freedom of Opinion

Freedom of Choice

Freedom of Liberty

I may have forgotten some of them, Which isn‚Äôt my intentions. BUT, I know for a fact that if I were to show public support for a protest group, I wouldn‚Äôt get my life ruined.

Also, did the The British colonized Hong Kong during there massive expansion?
And didn‚Äôt the United Kingdom owned Hong Kong, up until 1997?

If so, and I know I‚Äôm right, Hong Kong wasn‚Äôt always part of China.
Also Hong Kong hasn‚Äôt showed support for the Chinese Government.
I, for one, would imagine Hong Kong would slowly support the Chinese Government, but over the years, Hong Kong trust and support for the Chinese Government has decreased and decreased and decreased. And it hasn‚Äôt gotten any better.
Or another civil war! Take back the mainland! Hawaii for the win!
[deleted]
that is how you guys doing in hong kong. if we dont support ur guys. then call us china's dog, slave of xijingping. who gave you the rights to accuse other people? who gave you the right to stereotype us? you are doing the same thing as the Chinese. I am sponsored?  shall i show you my blizzard game account with every game I have purchased?  once we told the world you guys are evil then you dont allow us to speak. THATS ENOUGH.
No, no. I'm just copypasta the same thing that this guy has been copypastaing all over the place. I'm pro HK.
Your kind never came to the mainland anyway
Promote what lol
Well to be honest, my kind was Native Americans of the plains, so yeah

I just really like Hawaii.
What about the Guitar Hero trilogy
As well as Rock Band

NOTE: NOT THE RECENT INSTALLMENT OF ROCK BAND
Rick music in itself is breaking away from society, going against the grain. By making a game on it, the creators are trying to show the big picture, that we should stop taking everything for face value and rebel. Mildly political

I would love to be compared to Pooh. Dude has personal problems.
Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!

It's the same picture!
But these pictures are both of the same person? I personally see no difference.
The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: ÂÖ≠Âõõ‰∫ã‰ª∂, li√πs√¨ sh√¨ji√†n), were student-led demonstrations in Beijing (the capital of the People's Republic of China) for the establishment of basic human and press rights and against the Communist-led Chinese government in mid-1989. More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: ÂÖ´‰πùÊ∞ëËøê, bƒÅji«î m√≠ny√πn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.

Pooh himself is not the problem.  He's cute and lovable and I doubt Xi minds being portrayed as such.

He was banned because people can use Pooh cartoons as an indirect way of criticizing the government.  That's where the problem lies.
HELL YEAH IT IS

FUCK CHINA
Cuz it bothers him. Literally the only reason.
I think the last 2/3 of the comment suffice. :)

Edit: added the happy lil :) to make it clear I wasn‚Äôt trying to be a douche.

boi are you stupid
Copypasta of Chinese human rights violations.
a copypasta of CCP crimes, and if you paste it into game chat with an annoying Chinese person their connection will drop. It's the new version of Taiwan Numbah One, but better.
The comment you're replying to is on your side. Unless they've edited it, I think you've misunderstood.
I thought that was a fucking clown! 
But if i squint my eyes and tilt my head i can see the cartoon bear!
Same.. as long as he hates it I'm happy and will continue to enjoy it.
The wonderful about uighurs, is uighurs are wonderful things. Their tops are made out of Transplantable Organs, their bottoms are bound together with chains! 

They‚Äôre expendable, bendable, killable, sellable, genocide is fun fun fun fun fun! 
 
But the most wonderful thing about uighurs is Cheap Transplantable Organs for everyone!!
Winnie the Pooh is wholesome and friendly character who wants to eat honey and be friends.  
Xinnie the Shit is a psychopathic tyrant who wants to commit genocide and be feared.
nah, cuteness is non-existence in totalitarianism, CCP considers anything cute as an insult to their authority
>That's where the problem lies.

No it's not a problem. Only to the warped minds in China is it a problem.  


But it's not a problem, at all.

yo wtf is this
Damn~
Perhaps the inaccuracy of the comparison is why it irks him so.
There's a difference between looking nice and being nice.

China has been harvesting organs from Uighur muslims imprisoned in "containment camps".

>The wonderful thing about tiggers
Is tiggers are wonderful things!
Their tops are made out of rubber
Their bottoms are made out of springs!
They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!
But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is
I'm the only one
Haha ok that's a decent excuse. Apology accepted. Carry on
Not new most prisoners are killed and their organs harvested in China. Not having human rights means you could do anything you want.

Making rainbow merch makes LOTS of money.
Questioning the party doesn‚Äôt.
This is far from over. Access Now (prominent digital human rights protection group) called out Bobby earlier tonight. They wanted blitz completely unbanned and asked Blizzard to clarify their policies around human rights and freedom of speech. Here's the article: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/d3a5xx/blizzard-doesnt-respect-the-human-rights-of-its-customers-major-rights-organization-says
Blizzard loves using politics and especially social justice when it suits them.
So Blizzard supports LBGTQ rights, but also supports an authoritarian government that oppresses gay people?
Blizzard: "We are not a platform for divisive social or political views.... unless it makes us MONEY and doesn't harm our bottom line in a foreign country."
Congrats on doubling down on your bullshit with your double standards blizzard.
Hahaha, this post is a winner.

Social issues are used by companies when its financially convenient, not otherwise.
My wife was thinking about re-upping our wow subscriptions.  Not now.  They're so completely full of shit this denial just makes it worse.
Oh boy... how many gay characters are they gonna introduce next week to make up for this?
It's only allowed if it benefits them as a company.
wait is china not extremely "homophobic" and open  homosexuality is banned there? so i doubt that this would even air even 1 second there
I actually am 100% for Blizz supporting the LGBTQ community, but I still agree the flagrant hypocrisy of Blizz‚Äôs response today is disgusting.  It‚Äôs so transparently insincere that it insults me.  

It also basically also implicitly shows they never really cared about LGBTQ issues in the first place ... since all they truly love is money.

Blizz, either you stand for your convictions (whatever they happen to be) or you don‚Äôt.  Today I learned you don‚Äôt stand for anything anymore ... except making money.  That‚Äôs your only true core value.

I‚Äôm done with this company.
> One of our goals at Blizzard is to make sure that every player, everywhere in the world, regardless of political views, religious beliefs, race, gender, or any other consideration always feels safe and welcome both competing in and playing our games.

So, who exactly doesn‚Äôt feel ‚Äúsafe and welcome‚Äù because of somebody supporting democracy in front of a totalitarian, genocidal, organ-harvesting regime? Who was hurt here?
Yes wouldn't this offend Russians? Bullshit PR statement. Takes them a week to release one with no apology and a load of lies. Thank you, I hope you fold or at least move that sorry ass company to China.
Yeah, that's sort of the dirty little secret here. If the political message expressed was something popular with American progressives like LGBT stuff, they wouldn't have punished it.  On the other hand, if the political message expressed was something unpopular with American progressives like "Make America Great Again" or whatever, they would have punished it and most of you wouldn't have minded.
A lot of people in these comments fail to realize that the point. Blizzard has taken "divisive" political views in the past and there should be no reason they wouldn't do that now.
Yup total hypocrites, when it involves China it's a "sensitive issue" when it's the pride community they are all for human rights and try to monetize it with all kinds of rainbow cosmetics in multiple games.
Welcome to capitalism

 Can you imagine if someone after winning a tournament said something  like "Black Lives Matter", or "I support gay rights"?  Like hell  Blizzard would ban them, the casters, and take away prize money.   Seriously if, they're going to stand by their no politics stance, they  have to ban, and if they do, watch as all the social media rage about  Blizzard being intolerant and racist.
To be fair, they did say 'divisive social views'. That doesn't include /b/ basement dwellers that whine about pride.
Welp, its official Blizzard fuduged up beyond repair with this one
Wasn't the ok hand banned too?
I like that you made your point and didn't even use [the tweet from the actual Blizzard account.](https://mobile.twitter.com/blizzard_ent/status/1134509599208484864?lang=en) Might I add part of the funds going to the Trevor Project are used for advocacy, a.k.a. lobbying state governments and federal alike. (I support LGBTQ rights, just not blatant hypocrisy)
social justice is politics. No need for the redundancy.
Wait, when did they confirm that mei, mercy, zarya, pharah, bridgette, and moria are all lesbians? I mean, I assumed at least two of them probably were, but I just don't remember so many characters being announced.
A lot of people in this thread are just too happy to use this situation to throw the LGBT+ community under the bus and it's showing.

LGBT people are the first to speak up against pink washing. Of course it's a political statement. Of course it's hypocritical. But representation still matters and has a net positive effect on the world. "apache helicopter" jokes on reddit do not.
This is a great point
lemme steal this real quick
Standing up for social justice or politics is just another PR tool, they'll only do it if it makes them a buck.
Just you wait, now Blizzard will paint us as homophobes!

Really.... you are trying to spin this backlash against human rights abuses into an anti-gay agenda?

Honestly, you should move to China yourself. You would be very happy there. They hate gay people too... despite the fact that they have 2 or 3 men for every woman due to stupid extreme policies they forced on people starting in the 1970s. (And before that, they caused a massive famine in their country due to another thoughtless, extreme policy that they rallied everyone too-- the government there just never learns its lesson.)
What makes this more amusing is that in China, they hide the fact that Tracer and Soldier 76 are gay.

They only believe in freedom if it makes them money. If it doesn't, they are happy to turn the other way.
a lot of these slacktivists dont understand that.
thats literally what a business does, I dont know why you guys are acting like its some big thing that a publicly traded company does whats best for its shareholders.... Blizzard did what will make blizzard and the shareholders the most money.
If you weren't aware, in China for instance all the LGBTQ stuff is scrubbed. Tracer and Soldier 76 for instance are completely straight, in China. Multiple people have confirmed this.

The virtue signalling has always been a lie for dollars.
Then we DOUBLE IT!

Aren‚Äôt you thankful!


I guess that‚Äôs their standard response now.
Does cancelling a WOW subscription make you lose all your progress? Thinking of cancelling mine as well.
No matter how many new gay characters they release, you can bet they'll be straight as a ruler in China and Russia.
[removed]
I hope Bastion will identify as an Apache Helicopter and he get's a new Ultimate XD
If you think for a second that if china told Blizzard not to make Tracer gay- *oh wait, they already did!*
They also hate black people. That‚Äôs why Diablo Immortal had no Witch Doctor. 

If you want to see hypocrisy look up Chinese versions of movie posters. All black people are either removed or minimized. It‚Äôs pretty freaking hilarious because in the west they push racial diversity and LBGTQ to an extreme and in China they do the opposite. 

Companies don‚Äôt care about issues. They care about money. Companies are not our allies and we shouldn‚Äôt look to them for moral guidance.
Blizzard stands for making money. They don't care about you if you're not making money. The LGBTQ is seen as a way to look good and get more people engaged. Blizzard exploits the LGBTQ community for money. If there wasn't money tied up in China they wouldn't have done anything here. If supporting Hong Kong would make them more money then supporting China they would be doing that. China has blizzard by the dick and we all know it.
> Yes wouldn't this offend Russians?

Yes, but Russia doesn't lock down their country as much as China so it's less of an ordeal. Just censor and release.

Tracer and Soldier 76 aren't gay in Russia.
>Yes wouldn't this offend Russians? 

And almost half of Americans, but of course nobody gives a shit about that.
I might not agree with the whole MAGA thing, but I absolutely would not want them censored for stating their beliefs and kinda doubt it would have gone over well either.
And just think- China wouldn't even object!
LGBT stuff isn't divisive in United States coastal metropolises and college campuses, therefore it's not divisive at all?  Did you know that other countries exist?
China, Russia and several other countries where they market their products remain extremely homophobic though.
Its not just that. Their whole argument is "The game streams are supposed to be about the game and nothing else", but they're more than happy to rake in those wokebucks constantly in a blatant show of hypocrisy.
[removed]
That's kind of the point. Tons of morons complain about pride events, and they are correctly ignored because their ignorant or malicious opinions dont make pride a "divisive" issue. There is one right answer to the question of whether or not a gay person should have equal rights.

Whether Hong Kong should surrender their rights to China is a similar issue. The only thing divisive is that the people trying to take their rights will cause Blizzard to lose money if they aren't appeased.

So when their official statement is that it totally has nothing to do with China and that they just don't want to be divisive, gay pride would fall under the same umbrella.
dude most of the world is against pride. Most Muslims, even western muslims are against pride. As are orthodox christians. They are divisive in a world sense, maybe not as much as America. Remember that they did not release an OW comic in Russia because Tracer is lesbian. Most of the world is not pro your social views.
Exactly. Blizzard has taken a stance on a non-divisive issue before with pride. HK is an equally non-divisive issue. China's oppression is acknowledged by every major nation in the world, except for China (and if I had to guess, I imagine Russia and NK are mum on it). That group is not the most inspiring for determining who's on the right side of history...
Who‚Äôs complaining about liberty?

Why is liberty a political issue?
You mean the current executive arm of the United States Government?
I think its more about the hypocrisy of their statements, not about whether or not pride is a divisive issue. Their statement basically says "Blizzard does not wish to partake in politics" but supporting pride is an inherently political stance even if its the right thing to do.
Social justice has been made highly political lately, and as a result, the term has been tainted in a way. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair to dismiss all social justice issues as just politics. Racism and sexism are still very real. The fact that these issues are also political, doesn‚Äôt mean that they don‚Äôt exist, that they are just politics. EDIT: I don‚Äôt subscribe to SJW type of social justice. I am using the original meaning of the word.

"divisive social or political views"

Id say it fits into the "divisive social" part.

Why is it relevant during a tournament? They should be focused on the game right?
I think the comparison is fair since basic rights shouldn't be up for debate either.
> Since how long are LGBTQ colors considered a political controversy?

Ignoring western views:

Homosexuality is a crime in CHINA.
Its not really a controversy, but it's a political topic that doesn't matter for the game, that's why the comparison
It‚Äôs relevant because if they allow political statements that are controversial, and have *nothing* to do with the game, they should allow all of them.  They don‚Äôt get to try to score virtue signalling points on some non-game political issues but be absolutely cowards on others.
Communist China being a brutal authoritarian state isn't controversial either. That's the point.
>considered a political controversy

they said social too. Read the statement carefully
Well considering just today Blizzard banned the head of an all-gay WoW classic guild, and forcefully changed their guild name to not reference homosexuality... not much of a mistake. (The change and ban \*were\* reversed, but the rep that handled it said that they could expect it to happen again)
>Since how long are LGBTQ colors considered a political controversy?

How did you make it to the internet without knowing this?
It may not be divisive in America but it certainly is in some other countries If Blizzard are claiming to keep  their eSports apolitical, that policy should also apply to other movements such as LGBTQ+. 

It‚Äôs just evidence of hypocrisy and Blizzard showing clear favouritism for certain social movements.
What? WHAT? That statement could only be written by someone living in a bubble under a rock at the bottom of the ocean of a planet in another galaxy.
LGBTQ rights aren‚Äôt universal, and still stir up controversies outside the US.
clearly you've had no dealings with the American south
Wew lad, you really missed the point on this one.
It's not an anti-gay agenda, it's just pointing out Blizzards hypocrisy
Dude is pointing out the double standard, chill out
How many times did your mother drop you on your head?
You're even dumber than Blizzard. Reading comprehension is important, learn it.
Anti gay? Bitch you blind? They're sucking money out of the media by pretending to be supportive to the lgbt cause fuckhead, if it was offensive they'd ban that shit on an instant
Everyoneone understands that, that's the point...
Who is expressing confusion on this point?  I haven't seen anyone in this thread say, "But *why* did Blizzard do what China said.  Are they mad at America???"

No shit it's money.  A company can have integrity and still stay afloat, though, and many companies choose to *not* sell out their souls while staying in business.  People are upset because, while Blizzard *said* that's what they wanted to do, they clearly do not.  That's lying, and you'll find that people (yes...even "these slacktivists") do not enjoy being lied to.

There are even laws against companies lying to consumers, because people object to it so much.
because at some point money is not all that matters? [https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/09/nearly-200-ceos-sign-letter-calling-abortion-bans-bad-for-business.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/09/nearly-200-ceos-sign-letter-calling-abortion-bans-bad-for-business.html)
And I guess we're supposed to be OK with that and not hold them to any sort of moral standard?
I mean, you are speaking the unfortunate truth, but it shouldn't be that way. I gave you an upvote.
Upvoted, been awhile since I've seen that reference.
the only way you lose everything is by asking Blizz to completely delete your account, which MANY have done this week.
It does not.  I've cancelled many times over the years and always have been able to pick up where we left off.
As others have said, it won't - but depending on how long you're gone, you may need to do certain things. 

Ex, I stopped at the end of wotlk and came back for BFA, lost my talent specs, action bars and micros. That's worst case scenario tho I think because of the scale of changes I missed.
Hell no, you only lose your everything if you delete your account entirely.
Of course it does not.  Stop for years come back same spot.
why does it matter if you lose all your progress? Are you just jumping on the "hate blizzard" band wagon and is coming back later when it cools off? pathetic

No no, you're going about this all wrong. Here's what Blizzard will do in the coming week:

D.va is pansexual with her MEKA.

Sombra is actually a MTF trans.

Bastion actively identifies as nonbinary.

Winston is genderfluid.

Lucio is intersex.

If that doesn't fix the situation nothing will.
I sexually Identify as the "I sexually identify as an attack helicopter" joke. Ever since I was a child, I've dreamed of flippantly dismissing any concepts or discussions regarding gender that don't fit in with what I learned in 8th grade bio. People say to me that this joke hasn't been funny since 2014 and please at least come up with a new one, but I don't care, I'm hilarious. I'm having a plastic surgeon install Ctrl, C, and V keys on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me "epic kek dank meme trannies owned with facts and logic" and respect my right to shit up social media. If you can't accept me you're a memeophobe and need to check your ability-to-critically-think privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.

Cant the right get more than 2 jokes.
\^ The LGBT bashing doesn't take long.
Oh look, it's the only joke neckbeards have
The only mention of the sexuality of the characters are on comics. Have you looked at the versions of the OW comics in China?
But in Lol the "Chinese Splasharts" had a lot of" Blackfaced" Champs "Karthus" for example had a Blackface cause they could not show his Skeleton Face.
[citation needed]
>doubt it would have gone over well either.

So what *did* happen here when the OK sign was banned and Blizzard forbade people from flashing it?
And conveniently for Blizzard... LGBT stuff in their products aren't visible in those countries. You won't see for example the "Tracer and Emily kissing" comic in China or Russia. Blizzard is only fake "woke" when it's profitable to do so. Don't ever let their two-faced hypocrisy fool you.

I don't think i've ever seen a gay person "demand special privileges" let alone the whole movement. I've seen a lot of people start to be supportive of gay people where they previously weren't. Including my dad where 10 years ago he was against gay marriage and was mad they had a macy's day parade float, that shit happened because people were vocal about wanting to "just live their life like any other person". 

&#x200B;

I get if you're annoyed that SOME of them have demanded special previlages or not condemned inappropriate public behavior, but the whole movement isn't some mindless drone. What I don't get is you being upset about representation being demanded. That is extremely important for somebody to feel like they belong in our society.
Watch Chapelle indict the alphabet people. Much of your sentiment
> I just want to live my life like any other guy, with another man who I love. I'm not special. I don't need to demand everyone cater to my sensibilities just because I'm in a minority.

Why do you think that's even possible today in the US?
It's certainly not at every event man, generalizing doesn't work and never will.
>instead of letting it happen naturally if they just behaved like normal human beings.

This doesn't come close to accurately representing US civil rights history
Do you have sources for that Poland claim
Why are you getting your talking points from people who hate gay people tho...

Also: "As a homosexual..." and then you just go on a rant that could come out of the mouth of any homophobe trying to be sneaky about it. I'm not saying that you aren't gay, just pointing at how it has no effect on anything you say after. Like are we really going to blame gay rights activism for the hard-core right wing politics of Poland? Is there any problem not caused by foreigners or minorities according to those guys, lol?
[removed]
If they're equal, then they should be banned from promoting at official blizzard events like everything and everyone else.
I'd argue that in most of the US that is quite the "divisive" issue.  Just not for the average modern day internet user.  There are indeed many people that "at blizzard's sole discretion" would be offended by it.  It doesn't make them right, but neither does supporting any number of social issues.

My point is that any other "statement" about social policy falls into that category.  Lucky that blizzard can just pick and choose what makes them more money.
Equal rights is one thing. Running parades and other public events to showcase your private life is a different matter.

I mean, if they want to be equal in status, why organize events for one group but not the other? LGBT community has in large part dissolved into simply milking privileges instead of fighting for equal rights at this point.
Uhhh check again dude
Every political and social issue is divisive otherwise it wouldn't be an issue to begin with.
You have law and you have an individual ‚Äûfeel‚Äú for justice. Sometimes they do not match. ACTIVISIONBlizzard might have been completely in the right, still, i deeply despise, no hate what they have done.
It's not divisive, tho.  The rainbow is intended to imply inclusion of everyone. That includes straight poeple.

That's not to say that some people don't use it to be divisive, but the mere fact that symbols of diversity and inclusion appear is not "divisive" unless you choose to divide yourself away from inclusion and acceptance.
[deleted]
This is not political. That's the normal life of people, and the colors are worn just like your Iron Maiden shirt during a concert or Tracer's Overwatch skin punk. There is nothing controversial about this and it is a big mistake to say otherwise.
Then doesn't this prove that they aren't  trying to milk the shit out of the Chinese overlords?
That I don‚Äôt think you can blame them for. I almost guarantee (though this is speculation) that what happened was some A-holes submitted complaints about the guild name and an algorithm changed it automatically. That‚Äôs why the name was reinstated within a day. 

I could be wrong, but that doesn‚Äôt seem like a human decision there.
I got the point loud and clear.
It is definitely you who missed it.

Supporting/Acknowledging/Allowing gay people is as bad and evil in the eyes of the OP as banning someone for speaking out against human rights abuses.

In fact, you probably didn't even miss it. You are just a homophobe who is playing dumb in order to advance your agenda.
It really feels like you are damning them for acknowledging or supporting gay rights as though it is as bad as not supporting the people of Hong Kong against human rights abuses. Definite equivalency here-- saying both are bad, if not equally bad.

I don't see how one can claim that both are being profit-motivated as I cannot imagine there is much profit in loudly supporting gay rights as that only makes up about 10% of the population and I feel like more than 10% of the population is viciously anti-LGBT-- especially in gamer circles.

So, really, it seems like the LGBT stuff is an example of them being willing to possibly lose customers and money in order to reach out to, perhaps pander to, one oppressed group in society (though they aren't anywhere near as oppressed as they were 10 or 20 and certainly not 30 years ago).

If anything, it is an indication that they either changed their values or that they are only willing to take up fights on the side that has basically already won.
One too many i guess.
Never. But awareness of this sort of shit comes from being exposed to Christians enough to see their bullshit for what it is.

All for "freedom"...
Unless it means allowing people to be gay. Or to have any sort of sex. Or to do any sort of family planning. Or ingest any sort of substance they disapprove of. Or especially be any religion other than their own denomination of Christianity.

But other than that, all for "freedom".

This comes across as the same dumb Christian rhetoric.
"We always knew they were a company of the devil! Just look at how they helped gay people! Why-- not standing up for freedom against a regime that bans gay people is just more proof!"
I don't think you know how big the Chinese market is. Bizzard is literally just banning someone for breach of contract. They had two options, support HK and lose out on the bigger gaming / mobile market in the world or ban some dude for breach of contract, the choice is obvious
He is expressing surprise people are surprised a company is only interessted in money. This shouldn't be a new concept at all. Companies arent your friend. 


&nbsp;


All the gaming subs are being overrun by people that's essentially just now realized Blizzard isnt their friend, but a soulles coporation. It shouldn't have taken this one event to open peoples eyes, people should've know this was the case since the beginning(While they had integrity in the past, that doesnt mean they were your friend). If they charge you above the cost of making something, they are in it to make money (and there is nothing wrong with that, but dont be surprised when their views are only for the sake of cashing in).
No of course you can hold them to any standard youd like I'm just trying to explain why blizzard did what it did
Which is fair to them, they were probably actually annoyed at all the other controversies Blizzard has had and this was just the straw that broke the camel's back.

It's better that they're not tied in this emotionally abusive struggle for their wallet.
Or they may want to keep their progress in hopes that Blizzard will get the point and change their stance.
Everyone jerking each other off in this sub will be back. get real.
Oh don't worry. They also have some interesting news about Roadhog and Winston.
And none of this content makes it to China.
> Bastion actively identifies as nonbinary.

This made me giggle.
Am I not even allowed to use sarcasm these days?
Yes and i worked really hard for it, i needed to use all of my 3 braincells and 2 bottles of coke so i have enough Energy for my brain.
If you want to nit pick about the difference between 'a third' and 'almost half' be my guest, but it's still a hundred million people and doesn't affect my point.
Still cant believe 4chan pulled that shit off
I'll be honest, I'm not familiar with the incident you're referring to and I don't think I was even on this sub when it happened.
The OK sign became co-opted by far right people same way as pepe was as a symbol for racism and hatred. That's not the same as MAGA, although there is overlap between the two groups.

Some political stances are good, some are bad. Fighting an oppressive regime is good, nazis are bad. This shit isn't all that hard for most people to get.
Oh no, how morally objectionable, two males being in a relationship.
Uh what stuff?
Says the guy from Kotaku in Action. Try as you might, no one believes you that you aren't homophobic.
Lol this is classic denial
It works because society tends to divide into bigger groups that believe in something similar. That's generalisation.
It was on a newsfeed i was following. I can try to find it but I can't promise anything. It was a statement they got from counter-protestors of an LGBT rights protest.
... thundercock?
[removed]
I live in SW PA near WV. Trust me, it is still a divisive issue in areas of the US.
I believe they're comparing homophobes to the Chinese government, here.  Saying, "Oh, you offended a regime that sanctions organ harvesting from living minorities," is about as ridiculous as, "Oh, you offended homophobes," or racists, or whatever.

I was initially really taken aback at the presentation here, too (WTF, being gay isn't some sort of political stance!) but I can see what they were trying to get at (I think).
You basically just said it‚Äôs not divisive for the ppl that believe it‚Äôs a symbol of unity and inclusion. Homophobia exists, you know
It's the topic itself that's divisive, not the content. You can say the same thing about the content of Hong Kong, such as: 

Supporting Hong Kong is about making the world an inclusive place where everyone has the same freedoms.
I do not support LGBTQ. That already makes it divisive.
The LGBTXYZ acronym has no "S" for "straight" in it. It's an \*exclusive\* group of everyone \*but\* the majority. Just because they use the word \*inclusion\* doesn't magically change that
[removed]
Has the olypics ever said they don't allow talk of divisive political or social discussion?
It's not a "big mistake." Being bi is part of my normal life. Enjoying basic human rights SHOULD be a part of everyone's life. Neither should be a divisive "social or political" issue, but both are.
LGBT rights has been a political topic over right to marry for a long time. Now that general public consensus is where it should be on the topic doesn't mean it isn't or wasn't political.
You're being kind of ignorant. It wasn't very long ago that homosexuals weren't even allowed to marry in most parts of the U.S. It's still a terrifying experience for many people to come out and express themselves and their sexuality. And corporate America absolutely cashes in on this style of controversy to score woke points, when you can bet your ass twenty years ago their stance would have been that the sanctity of marriage is meant to exist between a man and a woman. In principle I agree with you. Sexuality shouldn't be controversial; it shouldn't really even be a topic of discussion. But it continues to be a point of division and since it's popular to claim support for LGBTQ+ communities, that's what shitbag companies like ActiBlizz will do.
If its not political then how come you see so many politicians campaign with it? Basic rights are part the normal life of people too. I don't agree with you but you know what? You speaking your mind is your basic right and I would never try to take that from you. Unlike Blizzard.
Uuuuh, hey dipshit? When did we legalize gay marriage? 

When was the last political bid to overturn gay marriage? 

We wouldnt have living memories of these events if "gay people are normal" wasnt a divisive political issue. We are still fighting to defend gay marriage from being revoked
If it's not so controversial or political, why has Blizzard repeatedly kowtowed to homophobes on WoW? At least twice now they've forced gay guilds to change their names because it offended people having a reference to homosexuality be public, and once threatened a woman for recruiting for an LGBT-positive guild.
It proves just that when you consider their gay characters are magically not gay in China.  It's all about wokebucks, not them actually giving a shit.
No, because all mention of homosexuality, or indeed any kind of sexual or gender orientation, is censored in the Chinese (and Russian incidentally) translations of all Blizzard products.

There is ZERO homosexual representation in any Chinese version of any Blizzard game or product. Because they value milking their Chinese overlords above any social justice cause.
comment of the week
To be fair, a guild referencing straight sex in the title probably shouldn't be allowed either. It's not appropriate and quite weird.
Dude why are you so stupid ?
Holy shit dude. You are being really dumb. OP isn‚Äôt saying that supporting LBGT is wrong. It‚Äôs perfectly fine. Logically, it follows that supporting Hong Kong is also perfecting fine. Yet Blizzard says that supporting political and social causes is disallowed. We are pointing out the blatant lie Blizzard is trying to sell us.

Seriously, you really, really missed the point and are having a knee-jerk reaction against something no one here is saying.
...the OP is just pointing out the hypocrisy of Blizzard saying they want their streams to be focused on the game...
Personally, I don't get an "anti-gay" vibe from the OP.

The argument is that the stance of "their platform is not for political views" is one of convenience, pulled as a card at this moment to divert anger at them because /shrug "there's nothing we can do. The rules say no politics." When they are clearly okay with setting aside said rule for other instances of importance that need to be acknowledged and discussed. Hong Kong's fight for democracy is an important issue like LGBT rights are an important issue.

The frustration is that for some reason, Blizzard does not see those two things as something of equal importance, business motivations being as they are.
There is plenty of profit in supporting gay rights, there is a reason just about every corporation put a rainbow filter on their shit during pride monthz they don't do it just because they support support gay rights.
>It really feels like you are damning them for acknowledging or supporting gay rights 

In other words, expressing a controversial political opinion, in other words doing the thing they just got done telling us was a punishable offense.
I‚Äôm willing to wager that more than just gay people support gay rights. 

But of course I could be very wrong
You clearly do not understand the point of this post. There is nothing anti-gay about it.
You really just want to be angry about something nobody here said.
You are commenting everywhere on here parroting some stuff when you are completely missing the point.  The news story literally already covered what you are parroting everywhere, what we are saying is that the fact  that they value that money over human rights is the issue. Its the same with Nike and their sweatshops, japan and their vietnamese worker population, south korea and their bosses with their "waiting" subordinates.  Just because they produce higher profits doesnt make it okay, and thats why we will call it out and publicize it in order to eradicate it.
Yeah. We all understand why they did what they did. They‚Äôre hypocrites for it, and we‚Äôre mad that they have sold their soul for money. The people protesting this don‚Äôt give a shit where the money. We care where human decency is.
> All the gaming subs are being overrun by people that's essentially just now realized Blizzard isnt their friend, but a soulles coporation

Of course they are just now are realizing, Blizzard acted as this ''family friendly'' company for years, where people bond and make memories. Blizzard did use that as a marketing strategy for like a decade. They liked that reputation and had this cult-like following with common phrases being like ''Man, Blizzard such a good company''. They wanted the emotional attachment.

With this backlash now they will be forced to drop that facade because their image is tarnished and their PR team is gonna have to come up with new ways to market their stuff.
> He is expressing surprise people are surprised a company is only interessted in money

Who is expressing surprise?  All I see are people mentioning it.
Yeah...literally no one was confused as to why Blizzard did what it did.  No one was thinking, "Hmm, I wonder if the CEO of Blizzard was having a sad day," or "Could it possibly be an intense hatred of streamers????"  We all know it was money, because they're a company and every company is trying to make money.

People are objecting because it was possible in this situation to both make money *and* stand up for human rights, and they chucked the human rights half out the window so quickly I think they got stripped out of neighboring countries, as well.
Hahahahaha no
I know, no one really cares

I wasn't on the sub when it happened either, it was an honest question.  You can read a lot about it here and there on the internet. Here's an example headline: 

https://dotesports.com/overwatch/news/blizzard-discourages-using-ok-gesture-owl-arena
"Oh no a bunch of trolls from /pol/ said that the OK sign is racist! Therefore we must stop using it (even thought people like Barack Obama and Neil deGrass Tyson used it in the past, but whatever I guess they're secret white supremacists) alongside other racist symbols like milk and *Clowns* !" 

You do realise that this kind of thinking is the primary reason why /pol/ has so much power right?
>The OK sign became co-opted by far right people same way as pepe was as a symbol for racism and hatred.

Neither of these happened, it's fascist to tell people to not use Pepe or OK.
Another reason (that doesn't hinge at all on knowing that the drag show thing is happening and is a widespread phenomenon -- a fact that I realize some people will dispute) that is harder to dispute: all of the abrahamic religions, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, teach that homosexuality is a sin. People who belong to those religions and accept their teachings are not necessarily homophobic. Reasonable people can disagree about what is or isn't morally acceptable, that's a natural consequence of living in a diverse society that is tolerant of a wide range of viewpoints and that protects religious freedom.
I can think of many issues, one that comes to mind which I think almost everyone agrees on are drag shows for young children in public libraries.
These fuckers are so obvious with their canned talking points.
Ad Hominem.  Your argument that he comes from a place doesn't mean that the argument is invalid.  Attack the argument not the person.
believe whatever you want, normal people aren't okay with things like drag shows for kids at the public library
Are you saying you [hate women](https://imgur.com/a/Wq7wE)?
Even if that was enough to make a substantiated claim about this supposed rise of homophobia in Poland, a denial of basic human rights on the basis that you don't like the form of protest is not a legitimate argument and shouldn't be framed as if it's a good point.
The symbol is universally inclusive.  If someone doesn't want to be included, it's not the rainbow that's excluding them.  It's their own attitude.

Case in point: Tracer and Soldier:76 are canonically homosexual, but not in China. All mention of their sexuality is scrubbed in Chinese versions, and the comics depicting these relationships are not viewable in China.
Mentions of characters' gender isn't censored in Russia, this is actually on Blizzard itself.
It's an far left tactic to claim that their political opinions aren't really political opinions. That's what he's doing.  By even acknowledging that controversy exists around LGBT issues, you are anti-LGBT as far as he's concerned. It's just another way to keep people from thinking/talking.
It'd look a lot better if they pointed out multiple types of hypocrisy instead of just pointing it out when dealing with LGBT issues.
And you have just spelled out the trap.

You are saying that allowing/accepting gay people is inherently a political statement. One equivalent of not standing against the oppression of the people of Hong Kong.

And thus you are saying that the opposite, attacking/banning gay people, is a perfectly valid and just political policy to have that would be the equivalent of standing up for the people of Hong Kong.

That's the insidious part of the OP's statement. It turns allowing gay people into an inherently "political" statement rather than just accepting the reality that roughly 10% of people are born with more inclination to be attracted to the same sex than the opposite one.
Nothing anti-gay about claiming welcoming gay people is the moral equivalent of banning someone for speaking out against Hong Kong?

About saying that both are evil political statements and to be morally consistent, neither should be done?
Thats kinda my point, no company should ever recieve that amount of trust, and you should always be sceptical. I am well aware why this is happening, its the same with the Fallout 76 defenders for Bethesda etc. People get too invested in the company/brand names.

Blizzard didnt create Diablo 2, David Brevik, Erich Schaefer, Max Schaefer, Rick Seis, Phil Shenk, Kurt Beaver, Stieg Hedlund, Matthew Householder, Phil Shenk and Robert Vieira did. Most (if not all) which do not work at Blizzard anymore, and didnt work on Diablo 3.


&nbsp;


Ideally people should stop idolizing company logos, and instead invest into who made the game they enjoy. It's no surprise to most of us that Blizzard is the way it is, and that Diablo 3 is what it is/was, the creators of the franchise went to make hellgate: London and Torchlight.
No.. it wasn't possible.. it was either support HK and lose probably the biggest marker in Mobile gaming or ban some dude for breach of contract (witch he did, he breached contract). The choice is very obvious if you want to make money.
I'm not saying it's likely but that doesn't stop people from hoping it will happen.

This one doesn't hold for me. [I'm not convinced the supreme holy texts of those religions categorically condemn homosexuality.](https://www.hrc.org/resources/what-does-the-bible-say-about-homosexuality)

Hiding behind religion to promote bigotry isn't a valid excuse.
That's honestly something I didn't know about. I'll look into it. I'd agree, that's not appropriate for children in a library setting.
Ad hominem does not apply to arguments over identity specifically because person is the argument. If he's active in places well known for their homophobia then it's likely his argument is not at all in good faith and if we cannot trust him to argue in good faith then what good is his argument?
Believing that stuff like that is supported by the LGBT+ movement (it isn't,  we find it just as weird as you do) and that it's a bigger problem then people's human rights is precisely what makes you homophobic.
Imagine doing this for every single large political movement, there is literally none that can pass this purity test of yours, makes it pretty shit test.

I didn't downvote you
You are missing the point.  It's not 1968 and you also didnt mention another instance in which the olympics was used as a platform but the people werent banned for breaking the rules to contrast with them being banned.  The point of the post is that Blizzard will only use politics if it makes them money and ban it if not, that is not an example of such a think unless you have an example of the olympics profiting off politics by actively pushing it.
I was about to go to bed, but one more thing about your post popped into my head that I think needs to be addressed before I can sleep.

You seem to be focusing on the fact that people are just born gay as the topic point. 

That's not what I was talking about. The topic point is "Do LGBT deserve rights?" And the answer is simple: "Yes, they do."

LGBT people are human beings and deserve the same basic human rights and dignity as any other human being. That phrase can be extrapolated to any number of people: Jewish, Black, Gay, Asian, Muslim, Uyghurs, the people of Hong Kong.. All of them are human beings deserving of the same freedoms, dignity, and inalienable rights as any other human being. 

And that is why the subjects are of equal importance. And why Blizzard treating them differently in such an obvious manner is frustrating. Okay, now that is out of my head, have a good night!
I disagree. Just because there is a counterpoint to something does not mean it has validity.

Facism, Authoritarianism, Nazism.. are all matters of politics. But *none* of them are acceptable or valid, in my opinion, and I would challenge them the same as one would challenge the attacking and banning of the LGBT communtiy.
>You are saying that allowing/accepting gay people is inherently a political statement.

Of course it is if Blizzard is a 'global company' because gay people are not accepted in plenty of the places they want to operate and it would take a great deal of political action to change that. 

Just because something isn't controversial *in your neighborhood* doesn't mean it isn't controversial. 

>And thus you are saying that the opposite, attacking/banning gay people, is a perfectly valid and just political policy to have that would be the equivalent of standing up for the people of Hong Kong.

Acknowledging something is a political position means acknowledging it is perfectly valid?  I'm sorry but you're totally making that up.
There is nothing wrong with supporting a company, that is how they get big and how you meet new people through their games.  Without passion, sometimes you cannot really immerse yourself and enjoy the products a company puts out.  And thats okay, but it also means that an interruption to that dream (such as Blizzard's antics) will lead to extreme backlash.  

Some people like to have control and be on guard all the time, ever a skeptic, but some of us dare to dream and be idealistic. Call us naive, but after a long day at work we just want to unwind and spend time with our friends, and the great products these companies put out help us do so, so we entrust our money to them and hope they use it to support their own families and pass times.  

It is important that wrongdoing by companies be called out so that we can decide whether or not we want to support their behavior.  The more attention to wrongdoing, the better, so that everyone can make their own informed decisions.
They could *easily* have given a slap on the wrist to technically stay in line with China's wishes (the way they have for every other violation of their "offensive" rule), and they didn't.  There are always options to work within restrictions, and they didn't even give it a token shot.  Acting like their hands were tied and poor Blizzard was just trying to do its duty as a company is really misrepresenting the situation.
Nah he just wants to feel good about himself and jump on the band wahon. Shit like what he does just proves that blizzard did was the moniterily sound choice, even if blizzard does something reprehensible their players won't care. I even saw a dude earlier fake "burning" his blizzard collection except he was just flipping his games the bird...
You feeling that too the ratings are getting shill in here. might need a jacket.
Careful, you're using rational thought! Better have a license for that, mate. Might want to subscribe to the newspeak before you lose social credit points.
What argument did I make? You're the one making points and needing to apparently backtrack a fair bit.

(also 22% is closer to 1/4, not 1/3 or 1/2 - \#math)
To be honest, I didn't either. It's really upsetting. It's been happening for years; some of the shows seem less objectionable than others. Some are completely out of line.

Oh... so like... the same logic that people assume all black people are robbers because there is you know... like this overall knowledge about how black people are thieves.  Like an outsider of the attacked group would know anything about the people in said attacked group?

Like that?

That's basically the same logic you want to apply here.  

Neither statement that you made about the community he comes from, or the racist statement I conjured show that there is a truth about it.
i'm not homophobic and sadly the drag shows are a product of the lgbt movement; that's why they exist. i recognize that not all gay people will support them, that's why i distinguished between the "lgbt pride movement" and gay people. not at all the same thing. gay people are just people. the lgbt pride movement is a transgressive social movement.
[removed]
*based on an EXTREMELY limited samples behavior.
Okay, but how is standing up for one group and not another in any way hypocritical?

The simple reality is that such is just the way humans have always worked.

People around the world condemned the Nazis for killing the Jews.

But the Japanese did just as bad to the Chinese and those who were at the top of command mostly spend less than 10 years in prison before resuming their positions at the top of the government or in business.

Meanwhile the people in Britain continued to treat the Romani like crap despite the fact that the Germans also put them in the camps along with the Jews, the same people who freed the Jews from concentration camps stood against the civil rights movement in America and were part of maintaining apartheid in South Africa.

Unfortunately, we humans are always going to be in the position of "I will take up this fight, but I don't have the time or energy for this other fight."

And these are generally often only fights because the people on the other side think they are fixing some other sort of unfairness or injustice that might not be readily apparent.
I mean, how severe the punishment should be is up to debate I guess but my point still stands. blizzard acted pretty neutral, they banned a player for using their platform to spread a political belief something with goes against a contract they signed.
If their players didn't care not only would someone not even bother to actually stop playing the game instead of just claiming they had,  but blizzard wouldn't be going into damage control mode right now.
found the nitpicker that doesnt even research common information himself.  do you ask people for citation when they say that Trump won the election by a landslide? you can google that stuff easily, citations are for information that is hard to find, if we cited every damn thing that would be just annoying.  here let me cite my sources for why drinking water is good for you- just kidding google it youself that shit aint hard to find.
The fact that several of the "queens" have been revealed to be convicted sex offenders honestly doesn't bother some people, because "promoting inclusiveness" is so much more important.

https://i.imgur.com/WHxovyu.jpg
Are you linking an article with tag "LGBT indoctrination" and Breitbart and expecting anyone to take you seriously?
Not to mention [that one in Houston which allowed a drag queen despite his conviction for child sex offences... twice](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/second-drag-queen-story-hour-library-reader-exposed-as-convicted-child-sex-offender)
This comparison is completely asinine. The assumption that a black person is a thief because all black people are thieves is based on an uncontrollable characteristic. Regularly contributing to certain subreddits is entirely at an individual's  discretion.

Following in your race example, your comparison leads to "This person is racist because he's white" being equally as objectionable as "This person is racist because he's openly a member of the KKK".
This is obviously absurd. A person is not racist because of their skin color, but it's a perfectly logical assumption that someone who affiliates with a racist group is,  in fact,  racist.
This is less like assuming someone's a thief because of their race, and more like assuming they're a thief because they spend a lot of time in the shoplifting subreddit.
If you'd rather people lose their rights then a few kids play drag dress up then yes you're a homophobe.
Drag has been going on for well over a century in the US let alone worldwide, if you think it's a product of the lgbt movement you are severely underinformed
You're really good at saying words even though they don't really mean anything for your argument.

LGBTQ+ has *always* been a political discussion as much as Hong Kong is no matter what you think, it's a fact. Now that it's almost unanimously accepted, it doesn't *seem* political because it's not a political topic anymore.

The point is that Blizzard is saying LGBTQ+ is okay, but HK is not, even though they are both political.

You're giving off a very "I'm LGBTQ and I'm offended that it's being brought up as political."
It‚Äôs hypocritical because of their statements on advocating for political and social views using Blizzards platform. LGBT people deserving rights is unfortunately not a universally held opinion, far from it, and thus a divisive issue. The same goes for the people of Hong Kong. Whether or not they deserve equal attention is not the point. The point is that Blizzard is all about money and unapologetically so. They appeal to supporters of gay rights in progressive countries by using their platform to advocate for a social cause (while that cause is censored by other authoritarian, anti lgbt governments, so blizzard only really gains money and good pr) and then suspend and severely penalize someone for advocating a social and political cause with blizzards platform to appease a HUGE market in China. They‚Äôre blatantly hypocrites who only pay attention to their own policy when it makes them money. Nobody‚Äôs trying to devalue the importance of gay rights or saying that blizzard or any big company should t suppprt them. OP and most commenters are simply revealing just how hypocritical Blizzard is.
And you have spelled out yet another trap in counter to your statement.  If LBGT movement isnt a political statement, why is it being lobbied as such and often a talking point in presidential debates?  Being gay or lesbian isnt inherently political, but once you start parading it to "send a message" it is political.
I mean... Reducing the ban by 6 months is 'damage control' mode? The porblem here is not what happened to blizchung but how blizzard is bending to china, something they still are doing
> blizzard wouldn't be going into damage control mode right now.

What steps have we seen of damage control mode?  They haven't even acknowledged something happened besides the first bullshit "Yeah, we did the right thing" post.

Oh, and one apology to China swearing they'll defend their dignity at all cost.  That hardly sounds like damage control mode to me.
No, it's that **type** of player that doesn't care. If you are going to boycott a company do it right. Don't expect to return.

I understand losing game progress is frustrating, but you're boycotting. The whole point is that you ditch it. Deleting your progress is **more** of a point because players will feel no ties left with the game and are more likely to move onto a different one. That's a threat to Blizzard.

Being scared that you will lose your progress is exactly what Blizzard wants. That's the problem. When people talk about "slacktivist" this is who they're criticising. You have to come to terms with the fact if you don't want to play Blizzard games anymore, you have to do it right.
> citations are for information that is hard to find

*Narrator: This is not what citations are used for.*

Begone thot.
Breitbart putting their own spin on it doesn't mean they're innacurately reporting the basic facts of the case.
I expect honest and fair-minded people to take me seriously. I included that Breitbart link as bait for dishonest people like you who aren't interested in discussing the actual substance of my position (or of the articles themselves). I don't expect people who are unreasonable to take me seriously but I also don't care if they do or don't.

Its not asinine.  You want to defame this person because they come from X... 

I go to plenty of subreddits and just go there to argue.  It doesn't mean I support the purpose or the things in that thread.  

You have yet to prove that the subreddit is racist.
"We think that stuff is just as weird as you do but seriously it's not big deal just some kids playing dress up". 

Jesus Christ you couldn't fake it for five minutes.
i have no problem being a homophobe in your eyes
Precisely. That's why no one is satisfied with their half-assed measures. Hell it's more like quarter-assed really.
They shortened the player's ban to 6 months and restored his prize money to appease those who are boycotting them and then published an apology to China in Chinese saying something to the exact opposite effect. That's textbook damage control; try to shake off the heat without actually having to make any major changes.
Citation needed.
Shut up, bigot, you can't stop Progress‚Ñ¢
I never claimed the subreddit was racist,  and more importantly you refused to address my main point in that your comparison is untrue.
Just because it's weird doesn't make it a big deal. I think it's pretty weird that there are people who eat bull testicles but you don't see me talking about how they don't deserve rights.
[removed]
Yeah so we can both agree that this is not damage control it's just them doing basic PR, I've already seen posts like 'can we go back to normal now' on the HS subreddit... It's already blowing over for them
Oh, I see what you're saying.  I hadn't seen the (utterly laughable) letter that came out today, but it does qualify.  Thanks for pointing it out.
No I did.  I said it is not asinine.  I am stating that you are only allowing for a few parameters for how that operates.  

>Regularly contributing to certain subreddits is entirely at an individual's discretion.

And I responded that they may go there regularly to argue.  

I very specifically put down your argument.  It's valid because the person comes from X, and therefore you want to judge them without looking at the individual and why.

Also - you still have to prove that the reddit he is from is homophobe, and I did do that.  So if you want to argue about how I'm not responding to you, when I very clearly am... I'm still waiting for that answer.  I did mispeak and replaced racist with homophobe.  Still - it's not like you couldn't have drawn the line there.  But sure... a mistake was made.

You said... 

>Says the guy from Kotaku in Action. Try as you might, no one believes you that you aren't homophobic.

You are very clearly trying to equate being from Kotaku in Action with being homophobic.
ok
Basic PR would have been to have known this was a terrible move in the first place. They've only changed their stance (if only slightly) to try to get people to move on, something also known as damage control. Furthermore of course there are posts like that. Some people didn't care in the first place so they'd want to move on as soon as possible. Most people though aren't ready for it to blow over yet though.
I'm not saying their damage control is good because frankly they're horrendous at it and always have been (don't you have phones?). They're trying though, so all of this is accomplishing something.
The thing is this was not a terrible move for blizzard, they have only lost a small small fraction of what they would have lost if they got cut from china. This was the optimal move for them in this situation, especially since it's blowing over already
Oh yeah, that was an awful attempt, but at least it was an attempt.  Honestly, the longer they were going with just "Say nothing" as a strategy, the angrier I was getting.

Glad they realized they had to say something, even if they tried to toss their dumpster fire "apology" at the end of a Friday to hide the damage.
It's hardly "blowing over" because there's some guy on a single subreddit who wants it to be over.  This entire sub is filled with nothing but vitriol towards blizzard to the point where I can't even browse it for long and stay in a healthy mental state. Whether or not this was the right move for blizzard financially doesn't matter. If the only way they'll do what's right is if there's enough money in it for them then they might as well be on China's side anyway.
That's literally ever publicly traded company ever... That's how capitalism works
So let's hope people will realize that Blizzard isn't the root of the problem and we can finally be rid of the system that encourages them to act this way.
Also if you go look at blizzard stock it has yet to fall in any big way, if they would have been banned from china it would instantly start tanking
Which proves my point. Blizzard is just a symptom of a corrupt system that exists for the sole reason of extorting as much as possible out of as many as possible. If the outrage ends at Blizzard, people are begging for this to happen again.
People are not looking at the root cause of the issue. It's gonna happen again and again china is close to being the most powerful country in the world, thy already have control over a lot of American manufacturing. For example apple pisses off china, next thing that happens is apple losing their entire manufacturing chain over night nothing no one can do. China ha unbelievable power
Apple in particular is a bad example for this, they are already moving some production out of China and have said (you can believe them or not) that while a pain in the ass they have the capacity to move all production of US iphones out of China.

Hey this is cool and all, but we should choose another character for this, since the voice actor is currently living in china, she could face repercussions for this.  


Our actions could cause her death, so I think it's a better idea to use a character whose voice actor is not residing in China.
If this works, why stop with Mei?  Make all fictional Chinese fictional characters supporters of Hong Kong.  Fanfics support Hong Kong.

We'll need help from /b/ and/or /poll/ to fully do it. They're no one's personal army, but man can they change the world if they put their mind to it...
That's the whole point I think
Next week Blizzard releases Mei skin with Chinese flag
They will.
DEW IT
Lets save Blizzard from Frostmourne - China.
Let's organize this for real.
or they will go along with it and say "see? we're the good guys, we stopped selling OW in china!"
They'll just spin it to make themselves look like the good guys
This is a great idea!
Someone needs to create a mod that replaces the announcer with Liberty Prime.
This an ploy to get them to suck themselves just so we can watch and learn how to do it ourselves? Pretty hard trick
"How we win" how about you go out, representing your own company, and start announcing how your own company supports HK and see if you get to keep your job. Chances are if your company does business with China you won't. But if you're not willing to do it then you're making a statement to the world that money is more important to you than a free HK.
Ah yes, the 4chan strategy. You redditors and Chinese are so very original.
Sina Weibo, maybe?
Without a Chinese phone number, you cannot post anything to any Chinese forums.
I am an american citizen born in Hong Kong and I choke up with tears every time I see these posts. Thank you.
r/HongKong has already ran with this idea
...damn our A.D.D.!!
Like how everyone forgot about raiding Area 5... oh wait
Reddit wont forget. As long as the protests are happening, we will be constantly reminded of this.
Forgot about that half of reddit is owned by china?
Don't spam your referral link on the back of this issue.

What is on my right?
So what? You can be Chinese but be anti-china. There is no legitimate reason that someone would support totalitarianism government without brain or have brainwash. Mei is anti-china and her voice line approves it
I would hope that the ban pushes those people ever closer to rebelling against their ever worsening authoritative government.
Imagine comparing not being able to play a video game to what the Chinese government is doing to people
And just as the OWWC is going to start soon....
Check out r/hongkong
Imagine that. Blizz shat on everyone else in favor of China, then eveyone else makes China leave them too.
You mean Mel and Blizzard Freedom Hong Kong Democracy could end up in Google if repeated to often?   


Oh my, so we must be careful to not say to often Mel Hong Kong Freedom Democracy, it would be a real shame if Mel Hong Kong Freedom Democracy would bring search terms to the top if any of the  Mel Hong Kong Freedom Democracy words are in it.
Who do you think came up with this idea?
There‚Äôs already tons of great Mei art on r/HongKong. Check it out and [spread those memes!](https://i.imgur.com/4iK5WdD.jpg)
Damage is done
They can't though. The moment they take ownership of Mei as a pro Hong Kong character, guess who will be knocking on Blizzard's door?

Shouldn't be too difficult to get.
Yes because that was a meme people could relate too. Mei is just free publicity for blizzard and to the unknown person, they'll think that mei and blizzard are supporters of HK. It's really in r/HongKong 's best interest to not use her as a symbol tbh
Just like Flint Michigan water crisis.

Oh wait... That's still an issue.
I wish that was true, but in reality when someone makes a post in Blizzard in a few weeks the threads will be most likely filled with comments in a vein of "hurr durr Blizzard bad, Geraldo good".
It really isn‚Äôt though
And how would it help the people if Blizzard would stand up for Hong Kong? Blizzard isn‚Äòt relevant enough that China would care about them in any way. They would just remove their games from their country and move on.
OMG, times limited! Must make viral, ASAP!
*Show loyalty to totalitarian China over your fans and community*

*China turns its back on you because it never gave a shit about you and no amount of loyalty you show to it will matter* 

*all alone*
You severely overestimate the attention span of the average person on the internet.

A large margin of the people playing Blizzard games just casually won't even notice this.
Weibo literally means microblog. It's basically Twitter.

Sina is the name of a corporation. Means something like "New Wave"
Nah. It's hard to get. China phone numbers are registered with your true identity. 

You have underestimated the censorship in our great great China.
>they'll think that mei and blizzard are supporters of HK

Isnt that the end goal for this? Making Blizzard seem to be a deadset HK supporter would fuck their relations with China, their biggest market. (and seemingly the only one they care about)
>Yes because that was a meme people could relate too

People could relate to raiding a government facility? From what universe are you?
Did you actually know the US courts are putting a demand to Facebook to give government agencies backdoor access to the encrypted messages of 1.5 *billion* people, effectively violating Article 8 of the EU Charter of Human Rights, but some EU citizens might be hit with this?

No?

Do you want to find out if this story was made up...?
Oh...ok
It would cost China money if Blizzard stood up to them. If China is losing enough money they would hopefully change.
‚ÄúOur world is worth fighting for‚Äù
ANd who's gonna stop us?
I agree. But you have a terrible mentality. You shouldn‚Äôt just say ‚Äúnothing we can do. Oh well‚Äù might as well try dude
[deleted]
Not really, because it's not blizzard allowing this. Blizzard wins both ways
But China isn't their biggest market. China accounts for around 12% of their total revenue as of the last quarterly report (as far as I am aware).

What this *might* do is that the people who don't know a single thing about this issue will see that Mei was made into a symbol for HK democracy. And then a year down the line people will remember the association "Mei = Freedom for HK" without *any* of the context of what happened to make it that way.

Give HK the support it needs, but I am not sure this has the intended effect...
By relate I mean that all their friends knew about it and it wasnt a forced meme. The beauty about memes is that they come naturally. The forced ones die out the quickest
Facebook also changed their policy around misinformation in ads for Trump's reelection campaign
Blizzard just isn‚Äôt big enough of a company for China to care. Big company‚Äôs like car company‚Äôs just earn way more money and would be big enough for China to care.
Stop you from doing what? Posting Mei?

Nobody! Go nuts!

But I just want to call some attention to something:

In another post having 10k+ upvotes, they used a very specific flag as the background. According to one poster in said post, the flag used is the flag imposed on Hong Kong by the CPC/Chinese government.

So by posting that image and making that Mei image go viral, you might help strengthen the CPC's position *by accident*. Chinese people might see that flag and the high upvotes and believe that there's actually good support for it.

Which is why I keep saying that you should be properly informed before you attempt to *literally* flood a foreign media with propaganda material. 

Nobody is stopping you. Go nuts.
I didn't say don't do anything. I never even *alluded* to that anyhwere in my post.

If you want to do something, go to the Hong Kong subreddit and find a resource to help.
Well it was terrible
it doesnt matter if blizzard is allowing it or not if when people search for or engage with overwatch this kind of imagery is there?

the CCP isn't going to go 'well blizzard didnt actually make that so its fine', if memes supporting HK are what comes along with OW they'd rather get rid of blizzard than accept OW with the memes. Thats why blizzard acted so quickly to shutdown blitzchung, they know the CCP would kick them out before tolerating a statement like that.
Yes because Winnie the Poo airs daily in China. After all, Disney didn't make Winnie the Poo into  a meme about Xi so China really doesn't mind and ignores Winnie the Poo appearances in the media. 

&#x200B;

Right?
They banned winnie the poo because people said it looked lik Xi. The creator didn't allow this, but it doesn't matter for China...
Thanks for the correction. I dont know a ton about how blizzard operates, just got pulled in cause it blew up r/all. I figured eith how massive China is that it would be bigger than 12%.
Nobody should ever do anything then
Except china has shown it doesnt care about reddit, the small minority.
Disney has a *lot* more weight to throw around than Activision-Blizzard. So much that I'm not confident who wins that fight, Disney or CCP.
But winnie the poo was popular as shit. This mei meme shit is gonna die off soon
Yeah. You'd figure that with 1.3 billion people, it's a giant market. Problem is that between all the "western" territories, Blizzard also has 2 billion potential customers. And within that number, at least most people from Europe and the US/Canada have a higher potential purchasing power than the average Chinese lower class/lower middle class citizen.

It could be anywhere between 10%-14% since I'm seeing everything in this ballpark mentioned, so I took the average of 12% for the statement.

Which means that if this "backfires", this will be free publicity about one of their OW characters being a symbol of freedom, whereas a smaller market will be shut off.
Then we'll make them care, and go beyond.
Nah, CCP of course wins. Disney may be the largest media company in the world but they still can't compare to a government that has direct jurisdiction over 1/7th of the worlds population.
Cool. Thanks!

Post this EVERYWHERE.
This is how we win. We need to make blizzard characters the face of anti China. They will ban the games there and then blizzard will have to suck its own dick.
How do we... you know... make it happen?

***Let's do this.***
Smart.
Let‚Äôs make it happen Reddit family. Post this shit everywhere.
Yea, Blizzard would just remove Mei from the game tho...
I wish I had the money to give you an award.  This is the most beautiful idea I've heard of today.
This is the most brilliant thing I‚Äôve heard all day.
And we shall make it so
I support this
Such a shame.. (>;_;)> Liberate HK
Fight for freedom! Stand with HK!
Dont forget Chen stormstout and Pandaria are symbols of China too.
some advice :

Those words are wrong. if you want to say "stand with hongkong",the sentence should be"ÂÖâÂ§çÈ¶ôÊ∏Ø".  And please don't use this hongkong flag. It represent hongkong policeman. those protestors use black one.
Keep this up!!
You are a hero.
I would love to see Bastion's head plonked on Liberty Prime's body spouting pro-democratic catchphrases to represent the American support of Hong Kong's freedom.

As things gain traction and more nations voice their supports, throw in their own representative characters fighting by Mei's side as well. 

It would be great to have Tracer (UK) and Widowmaker (France) side by side with Widowmaker saying something like "We may be Talon, but we're not THAT evil" or some garbo.
Here is what I would love to see happen: All of this backlash and negative attention toward Blizzard and China results in Blizzard games being banned in China. Blizzard tries to make things right with players outraged by their kowtowing to China since they no longer can make a profit in China anyways. The players see through this bullshit for what it is, and Blizzard suffers massive losses this year as a result.
But that is not the flag that the protesters use.  See the red stars?
...but she's Chinese?
If you are on Hong Kong's side, this background is not ideal, because this flag is one that China has imposed on Hong Kong. It is the flag for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 


The protesters hate it so much that they defaced it and covered it with the flag that Hong Kong used when it was a British colony.

By using this flag as the background, you might, albeit inadvertently, be supporting China.
Blizzard side with Netease long ago, no wonder why they are now with Chinese government.
Can someone explain to me what‚Äôs going on? Why is everyone all pissed about Blizzard and what‚Äôs going on in Hong Kong? I feel literally so out of the loop
Haven't played Overwatch in ages, shall I pick it back up and exclusively play Mei and advocate for HK?
What does the caption say exactly?

this is brilliant

It's officially confirmed guys, Mei is now ethnically Japanese. You didn't hear it from me, because Mei is already off live servers, hero roster, and all known maps.  


If you oppress one of us, you oppress all of us.
Blizzard has already cencored tracer and soldier comics mentioning their sexuality.
get #MeiWithHongKong trending on twitter!
Dude, that's a 400iq idea. If there are huge Mei posters in the Hong Kong protests, no one will be able to ignore it.
#MeiWithHongKong 

POST THIS HASHTAG
Now that I think about it, Xi looks like Roadhog.
Photoshop her middle finger raised and add "fuck China" in Mandarin (if you haven't already - no idea what's written below her).
Funny how I created a good number of these Pro HK Mei images, posted them here, and they got removed. But someone else posts and gets platinum rofl.

Either way, glad this one stuck and didnt get removed.

While I understand the sentiment, and think it's in the right frame of mind, not sure getting Overwatch banned outright in China is the right way to go. That would stop a very large amount of Chinese players from being able to play their favourite game (I KNOW the issues Hong Kong is experiencing are much worse than a video game being banned).

To be honest, not even sure if what I'm saying is the right thing, but it's what occured to me. Fuck Blizzard and fuck the Chinese government though.

Why would this get Overwatch banned in China? It's just a fan creation, which wont be present in China, since in China half of the internet is censored anyway.

It's true. China should be tactical about it, as to reward loyalty, but they have zero chill, and definitely would ban it.

Also:

Instead of sucking its own dick, the more likely case is that Tencent will buyout more of the company so Blizzard will just have to suck more Chinese dicks instead

I'm totally down with that though, fuck this company :'(
That's actually a really smart idea.  Take it out of Blizzard's hands so much that even if they want to adhere to China's demands, they can't because of the symbolism associated with them.  Make it not worth it to China to continue doing business with them.
We‚Äôre sorry
Blizzard sucking it‚Äôs own dick makes me excited.
Delusional.  Why would this get Overwatch banned in China? It's just a fan creation, which wont be present in China, since in China half of the internet is censored anyway.
They already edit the games in china to be in line with China's laws. So good luck with your 5head ban wagon that won't work and enjoy your virtue signalling for the week you're at it.

Which would draw even more attention to them and further solidify their cowardice.
I always thought the UK simply shouldn't have given it back when the treaty elapsed. Or emancipated HK before the expiration and then instantly turn around and ask for US support and recognition as a nation state, followed by everyone else.

China would have had to just suck it, like anyone else who lost territories when global borders got really static a century+ ago.

Hong Kongers are also Chinese, only on a genetic level. Culturally, well you saw the news.
Udgir are also chinese that doesnt stop China to put them into concentration camp
There have been protests in Hong Kong to keep their liberty that they are used to after years of British rule. China has been finding ways to bring them back in line. Go read the news and get informed! Just stay away from political propaganda news sites like RT & Fox News.
 I was thinking of the same thing.   Perhaps joining China servers somehow and putting in chat ‚ÄúMei fights for Hong Kong freedom!‚Äù
So is Emily just missing or crudely re-drawn as a dude?
All I can give you is an upvote
They all have the same message behind them, so as long as Xing noticws one of them...
Wrong.

This decision for Mei to become a symbol of freedom is Lore-based on her character as a champion of hope.


What. Would. Mei. Do.
I hope it willl not be banned and Mei and Overwatch will become a symbol for a democratic Hong Kong.
If people not being able to play their video games is the SACRIFICE that has to be made to the altar of progress, so be it.
Blizzard will lose out on potential money. Why they picked the side of unfreedom was because money, so we‚Äôre stopping it. It is a punishment to blizzard

nope. u have to post it to chinese social platforms. thats the only way if you need the attention from ordinary mainlanders.
Wow Thanks for this! I didn‚Äôt know you could do this to someone. I‚Äôm going to take full advantage.
Blizzard removed skulls and bones and replaced them with random bread and wheat sacks in Chinese WoW, and censored several "inharmonious" Hearthstone cards *globally*, because it offended Chinese censors.

Blizzard would happily replace Mei, Tracer, Winston and any other hero from Overwatch with sacks of grain if it means they can keep sucking on the sweet teat of China.

&nbsp;

Still... go for it! I would love to see Blizzard completely ruin their trademarks for the sake of appeasing the always changing tide that is China's tendency to get offended by everything.
Well they've already made her straight in the Chinese version.
I'm afraid the UK is too busy trying to defeat itself currently
There was an overly optimistic chance that giving HK back to the mainland would have the opposite effect of what we're seeing now, a subtle way to introduce liberty and democracy into China. :( 

sad
I did learn this about 5 minutes ago. I apologize for my ignorant comment :(
Yeah but Mei speaks pretty clear Mandarin Chinese without any HK accent so it'd make no sense for her character to be from Hong Kong.
Either way, ActivisionBlizzard was this harsh about the HK thing because their deal with Tencent [just lead to the biggest mobile game launch ever and that was without the Chinese market](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever). So until people actually boycott all their IP this isn't going to do anything. They'll happily sacrifice Mei for selling more Call of Duty.
The comics are literally not released in China or Russia.

(Ironically, that's the reason why everyone knows about them.)
Yes, from Chinese users, who disagree with China anyway. Otherwise they wouldnt be using this. Btw, China has a population of nearly 1,4 billion people. 50 million hits per day is pretty low compared to that.
Free is a stretch since you have to pay for champions.

Suddenly Mei decided to go on a research-trip to an unknown destination!

New hero to replace Mei: 

notasellout

special ability: build a long ass wall and prevent other characters from doing anything to harm notasellout.
Then we move to another character, and then another... They would have to remove them all. Our cost is 30 seconds in photoshop and spamming memes, theirs is remaking the game, see who wins.
Nah they will just announce a another current hero is gay! And western civilization will forgot about anything China for the next month
Please, don't be. 

All the things on this sub, all the memes, and support. These are what we need and we are grateful.  Thank You.
She doesn't have to be from HK to support. Might be more relatable if it's not just "one of them" to a mainlander anyway, but instead somebody who sees what's going on and doesn't like it.
Yeah but you can get in game cash quite easily
That's a mental image I could have done without.
omg this whole chain of comments is making me chortle. Bless up
Should've said "volume", damn
Oh you mean it negatively impacted perception of the country?

Just like how touting a character who is chinese as a freedom and democracy loving high profile individual would? Literally rubbing freedom and democracy all over the face of the game such that the authoritarian government officials notice?

Hmm. Yeah that wouldn't be denigrating to the image of the country at all. I agree with you 100%
What the heck you're talking about? Their social platforms are accessible by international.
you always have our support,never lose hope.
Yeah but what are they called? 

I‚Äôve never heard of a Chinese social media platform.
Weibo
If you're interested: 

Weibo is like Twitter (there are various Weibos, but Sina Weibo is most popular). 

WeiXin (WeChat) is like WhatsApp but with profile pages and stuff and is very popular. People can add/follow pages or people by scanning a QR code. 

Renren is kinda like Facebook but isn't used as much these days. 

Douyin is TikTok but runs on Chinese servers (TikTok is a new thing that's like Vine but longer videos and is particularly popular in India). 

YouKu is like YouTube.
Weibo = Twitter       
Tieba = Reddit    
Zhihu = Quora   
Renren = facebook but it is not mainstream in china because they all using QQ/wechat which they can post social status and articles.    
Also quick tips if you see any players with names start in "Douyutv" "bilibili" in the game and you don't want them to be there, type Free Hong Kong in chat and make sure to include their ID. They are streaming, u know what i mean.
baidu and bilibili also

How far does this have to go before we see some actual blizzard values come back?  China makes up ~14% of their income atm, and even though it is projected to get a lot higher your money still means a lot to the company.

Furthermore, my late TBC (thousands of hours played across multiple games over a decade+) account is in [queue for deletion](https://imgur.com/a/FF2JRlf). If Blizzard doesn't reverse the course on this before my account is gone, I'm well and truly done. If they think I'll come crawling back on a fresh account because Diablo V or VII or X looks like all the hotness and my friends are playing it, they're sorely mistaken. I could easily set the world record in grudge holding Olympics and I have a long memory. 

Have fun and thanks for all the fish!
Lvl 60 rogue in classic and I just unsubbed too. I say this because getting to 60 took many, mannnny  hours.

Classic was great, but I‚Äôm not going to let this slide. 

If anything classic is emblematic of everything that current blizzard no longer is.
Developers like Mark Kern leaving Blizzard is what caused its downfall. Who could have known selling your soul to China could have a negative impact on the company?
I have uttermost respect for people standing up to China when it could have serious consequences for them.
Follow him for anime belly buttons. Like...a lot of them....its kinda his thing. He was also an adamant Epic games store defender, UNTIL Tencent took a stance on the human rights issue, he is now boycotting them too. Hes a bit...rough around the edges but hes a good guy.
Wow, that\`s a strong statement. I hope the founding members see this.
I cancelled my subscription and I'm going to get a refund for WC3 Reforged.
I loved the games but jesus christ ultimate oof blizzard
Who gives a fuck what he thinks. He treated his employees like utter trash and made a failed MMO
Please note https://twitter.com/blasternation/status/1181993793081532418?s=21
Mark Kern is based as hell.
Mark Kern, man of the people.
Everyone BLIZZARD APOLOGIZED!!! to China
This guy is based, I've followed him for a while. He sticks to his principles and doesn't sugarcoat things. A breath of fresh air tbh.
Good on him for this gesture, I guess, but people should be aware of this guy's strong anti-feminism, white-genocide-conspiracy-propagation, and general history of promoting alt-right views.

I know a lot of you probably *already know this and agree with him*; this is a psa for everyone else.
What a supreme champ
oh wow anyway its been long over due with how bad the OW scene became cancelled all my subs might even throw my account away
Wow. Bravo üëèüèº
I just submitted my request to have all my personal data removed from my blizzard account, effectively deleting my previous purchase history. Solidarity!
Thanks for being such a boss, Mark!
Keep posting Mei. The fire has only began
All important things aside, did the Team Lead on World of Warcraft have to pay a subscription fee to play World of Warcraft?
Thanks, bud. Here's hoping.

Not sure if this has been posted, but a more detailed excerpt of why and what happened to him in the past
I wonder why I should do with all my hearthstone cards. I have archived top100 legendary and I‚Äôve paid several hundred‚Äôs to stay competitive although I quit two months ago. LUL
So did J Allan Brack successfully win the awards for world‚Äôs biggest douchebag and simultaneously tanking a major company in the shortest amount of time? Cause if he didn‚Äôt, he should.
Canceling his subscription..? Blizzard employees literally have lifetime passes, so I'm not even sure if this does anything.
[deleted]
\#BoycottBlizzard for their #SuckDongForYuan.  Good on Kern.
I feel like I'm playing the clean uncorrupted version from 10 years ago, despite where the money goes. (Which I just blew my gold on instead anyway)
This is blowing way up since the last time I said it
Imagine fighting to bring vanilla servers only to have them shit the bed less than two months after launch. Incredible.
This doesn't make up for selling out FireFall to the Chinese.
I can't say that I play Blizzard games that often, and I've only spent $20 on Diablo 2, but I feel canceling an account is the only thing that will make Blizzard understand people still care about values instead of pure entertainment. Also I created a Reddit account purely to post this.
Paging one Jeff "Jeff From the Overwatch Team" Kaplan.  You see this?  Be nice if you followed suit...
Hell ya
Although i had not subscribed World of Warcraft, i bought Diabio 3 and spent a lot of time for this game.

But today for our democracy and freedom of speech, i deleted Diabio 3 and [battle.net](https://battle.net) on my computer. 

I cannot find the way to delete my account on [battle.net](https://battle.net). Maybe they will delete my account after i changed my battletag.

And yet, Mark Kern is still a massive douche.
Cancelled my sub as well.
What would be great, is people canceling their blizzcon tickets, nobody showing up.
I read this with Arthas's voice.
Holy. Shit. Now this is courage.
I was having such a good time in vanilla wow too. But this cannot stand. I wouldnt be surprised if private servers start springing up again.
I'm surprised he didn't do this when he got kicked off the team.
Mark Kern is OG.  Respect.
If you want to delete your account (for any reason) and now you can't, an alternative is to get banned.
Who is Mark Kern?
But did he? Did he really...
I already deleted as soon as i heard of this horseshit. Shame on you blizzard.
Lost in a lot of the discussion on this thread is that I didn't cancel my WoW subscription to punish Blizzard or to try to affect change (though that would be nice). I did it simply because I don't want to give my money to them.

I doubt our cancellations will have much effect. That wasn't my motivation.
As if I ever would quit classic wow over some bs politics psyop that has no impact whatsoever on me.
Way to take a stand. Also consider deleting your account wholesale. It doesn't directly hurt them, but it sends a clear message about valuing human rights and basic human freedoms over their products. That's easy for me to say though, I haven't invested the years that many of you have in WoW, that's a lot of investment and history to flush down the drain.
Sic Semper Tyrannis! We got more people to fight against communism!
So does/did he still work for Blizzard as the Classic team lead?  What does this mean, ultimately?  Initially I thought he was just a previous team leader who is now unsubscribing, but this post says he was the team lead for Classic.  Is he not any longer?
Big pp move
Mark has always been a stand up guy.  Really says a lot tbh.
You all think your small little sub cancellations will affect anything at all? Don't get me wrong, good on you for standing up for others and what you believe in. But while you delete out all the money you already cashed into blizz to buy the games and services. Actiblizz will be rolling in the billions of Chinese dollars they will not have lost. Your subs will change nothing other to then force people to repurchase in the future if something changes. I am no longer a fan of Actiblzz, have not been for years. Think when you do things. Just imo.

Btw: good job Actiblizz......
So you guys are engaging in this discussion by using sweatshop/slave labor built technology, right? If you don't refuse to buy a new phone or video game console or whatever you aren't really helping or standing up to anything.
Get your phones ready!!
Wow.. Awesome that someone of his stature finally stood up. Big props, Mark.
myself and my girlfriend have done the same thing.
Let Blizzard fail.

I came back with rapturous excitement when Classic launched and only 6 weeks in, I've unsubbed, handing Blizzard a similar message but that's not far enough. The fact of the matter is, Blizzard didn't blunder, it wasn't a miscalculation. It was a deliberate corporate decision from the very top in an attempt to keep the Chinese government happy in direct contrast to their human rights violations. There has been no uncertainty that China's actions are OK with the rest of the world, yet they still actively chose to support China and attempted to silence any voice of dissent.

They chose China over us.

So, let them fail. I've not only cancelled my WoW subscription, but I've ordered my entire account deleted. My remaining game time (4 months), my Overwatch, D3, D2 and LoD and Starcraft are now gone.

I'm not happy about that, but I can't in good conscience continue to support their corporate policy by playing their games ever again.
Refreshing to see an important voice such as Mark Kern weighing in on such an important issue!
Holy...
Now this is a yikes moment
Oh wow this huge!
Holy shit.
Lets all pretend mark kern isn't a terrible person.
I like tuudles.
Hahahahahah xd people rly think that destroying their own stuff and cancelling wow subs help ? In what world are you guys living?
If they ever "stand up" it will only be an act to make it look like they're sorry. I can see Blizzard talking to the Chinese government and coming with a plan to tone down the protest
As for me, absolutely support for Blizzard. It seems to support law. And not different idiots, it's good news
I don't know how people actually think, Blizzard will fall because of this. Yes, a few people will cancel their relationship to blizzard and brag about it, also people like Mark here, who I rly Like and I support all of it. But the huge majority will just continue to use blizzard as company. They support their own bad reputation, although the money won't stop to flow because of this.
 

If you were the CEO of a multi billion $$ company, what would you do?

Note that I do in fact support Hong Kong, but I stand by Blizzard.

China accounts about 90% of all eSports profits.

Players specifically sign a contract with stipulations to stay out of politics while on a blizzard platform.

1 comment can cost a company billions. Nothing to do with right and wrong.

It‚Äôs not his reputation he put on the line, it‚Äôs blizzards.

The ban was necessary to save blizzard from a all out ban of their platform throughout china. This would have netted billions in profit loss.

Most blizzard employees are young kids which lack wisdom and big picture in life. If they didn‚Äôt ban him, they might not have a job tomorrow. China would blackball blizz and then blizz would go bankrupt.

As soon as he opened his mouth.. blizzard was DOOMED one way or the other. I genuinely feel for blizzard and its employees right now.
Lol this just makes all you flops look worse. This is the guy who‚Äôs failed p2w shooter died and he was depressed.
Lol enjoy your new job.
The only people that will see messages like that are support personnel and I can guarantee it will never leave that office.
Blizz done goofed.
Big dick
What did he cancel since as an employee he gets the game for free....
Yep. I wish it doesn't go back to normal with an apology. Some people actually said "Until blizz apologizes I'm not going online". Can't blame them though. Personally I love wow and it's story and it's a shame what blizz did for biz.

Want them to pay haaaard.

Edit : Thank you very much for the plat my  Anonymous bro.
They double downed on their stance by silencing collegiate level Hearthstone players. They held up a sign that said "Free Hong Kong, Boycott Blizzard"; quickly cut away. No more interviews and the like from college level players. 

They're firmly in the pro China camp for as long as it makes financial sense to be.
Nah, thats a bad stance. There needs to be some path to redemption for companies that fuck up or no one will ever bother trying to redeem themselves.

A full apology, return the prize money, unban the player and rehire those two casters with more pay (if theyre willing to come back). Plus a plan for not repeating this mistake and actual follow through. That would be a reasonable minimum standard for regaining the public tryst.
Short if Blizzard directly staying they wear completely wrong and actually supporting the Hong Kong protests no apology will be sincere.  

Anything else is just an attemt to save face.  They have already shown they are currently willing to do anything China asks of them.
Would you rather destroy and entity than winning it on your side? This attitude is only inciting war. I would try a more peaceful approach to obtain justice, before going to war.
I'm fine if there is some reversal.  I think Kibler had had the most level headed take thus far
Hopefully they just ignore it and do not acknowledge it. It's probably the best move since the psyop media outrage disappears regardless in a week.
The side they chose was "don't hijack official streams for personal political protests".

Punishment was too harsh though.
Hijacking this to spread this as far as possible.

Until they get themselves banned by China for standing up to them, aint no forgiveness for these traitors! Did you see the Chinese version of the statement they released over this whole mess? They called China their "MOTHERLAND" and that they will always protect her honor..... WTF, TRAITORS!
I agree what they did was unforgiveable, but at the same time a lot of innocent people could lose their jobs
How much of their income comes from the United States?
Mark has always been great, it's just that up until now you weren't aware what was really going on.
True dat.
I've read the article. Wow
How? I don't know much about him at all.
[deleted]
I agree he's a piece of shit. But left and right are united on this. As long as we don't use this as an opportunity to push our own differing political agendas but just stand up for what we agree on, then it's all good.
Yeah he hasn't been involved with blizzard in 15 years. He has nothing to lose by doing this and he does it often. He thrusts himself into the spotlight whenever he can, using his former title to get attention and morally grandstand at every possible opportunity.

I dont disagree with his sentiment but it is tiresome when you see how often he does this. Literally every time blizzard is in the news this guy who is essentially a nobody comes out and makes a big PR stunt like he matters at all.
Disagree, he's a great guy with great tweets
Pretty sure The9 (chinese company that used to oversee WoW's operation  in China before netease took over) became majority owner of Red 5 studios ( Mark Kern's ) in 2010. He was outed only at the end of 2013. So yeah Kern already sold to China well before this incident. As much as I hate all this crap going on this is just a vapid AF move from a shitty person who already sold out to China once and now condemning Blizzard since hes no longer on the hook to care.
I canceled mine, and used his quote as my reason.
I was hoping this sub would become what that sub aspires to be
Well done, respect!
Props man! There are many with you!
I promise you that Mark Kern was not a loss for Blizzard.
Same with WC3. It kills me though. Maybe I‚Äôll pirate it if they don‚Äôt reverse their stance.
This is exactly what I first thought.. Firefall anyone??
Lol being wrong and having a shit opinion about one thing doesnt mean he cant be right in other areas? What's with this obsession of finding old tweets regarding irrelevant topics and using it as a way to ruin someones entire character.

Pathetic.
This is like a third or fourth hand accusation.
i don t see anything wrong.
Mark Kern didn't state anything wrong in that tweet. His opinion was not "alt-right"
Is there anything else or is that it? Is that the worst tweet they could find or what?
Where's the lie?
Kern periodically nukes his Twitter account so stuff doesn't come back to bite him.

Doesn't always work though.
Wow, had to dig long and hard for that, huh? A tweet from over 4 years ago. . .
Hot take : certain websites deserved the gate and improved markedly as a result

The top 3 gaming news sites used to be full of stupid shit like the verge PC building video and undisclosed affiliate links
Seriously, this. Kern is a moron.
Thanks now I like him even more
Hmm yeah, this ain't great. A broken clock is right twice a day, I guess.
As a member of the Alt-Right, since it's such a nebulous term at times, I fully support Mark Kern. Anything to the right of PRoC is alt-right.
No they didn't. Blizzard has been silence. I believe you are referring to some chinese hearthstone Twitter account that apologized to China.
He's a shitty excuse of a human being that treated his employees like they were simply trash under his shoe. You think Amazon workers are treated like trash? Well, take that and multiply it by 100.
Yep, he's pretty slimy himself, though I'm generally taking that as a sign of just how big a mess Blizzard has stepped into. This is a politically broad-spectrum fuckup.
He's a complete and utter weasel, it's true; but hard times make for strange bedfellows.

I think it just goes to show that almost everyone who isn't a member of the effing party wants Blizzard to burn right now.
The fact that even people like him are standing up agains't Blizzard, really shows how colossal their fuck up was
"The issue that has brought us all together is besides the point: what really matters here is that I don't like his political views".
So anybody who disagrees with the left is now alt right? He is not any of the things or has done any of the things you listed. If you truly believe so post evidence instead of just asking people to take your word as fact.
Yeah this guy has opinions I disagree with fuck Hong Kong.
This is the first time you have antifa leftists and alt-right klan members agreeing on something. Let's just enjoy this moment for a minute.
The fire rises
He worked on the original game back in 2005 and has since left the company. Before classic was announced, he voiced his support and met with the Blizzard executives, along with the guys that were running the Nostalrius private server. As long as you are an employee, you don't.have to pay a wow sub, but since he has been long gone, he is subject to a subscription like any of us.
You should dust them on stream while explaining why.
lol no they dont. I know, because I use them.. They are one year game cards , They expire.
I‚Äôm not sure one will want to forsake his job that he clearly loves doing for the sake of a boycott. Keep in mind Jeff still works at Blizzard, Mark Kern doesn‚Äôt.
He wored on classic classic. as in he worked at Blizz 15 years ago
What's your comment doing to help?
'helping' doesn't mean what you seem to think it means.

You literally just typed the same argument the meme of the kid saying "and yet you live in a society" lmao
In a world where 1 million cancelled subs equals 15 million US$ they are not getting this month.
In a world where PR image matters. In a world where marketing and profits need to strike this delicate balance between money and morals.

Blizzard decided that they will bend their asshole to the Chinese market and went full scorched Earth tactics. Good for them tho.
Sucking ccp dick too much here, bub
They have managed to get government attention over this and the #1 most upvoted post in Reddit history is over this. It is hardly a few people boycotting them.
>Mark Kern

He left Blizzard in 2006 co-founding Red 5
He has his own studio. He made enough money from WoW to live comfortably for years
Idk, I'm not support personel and I can see it.
I'm looking at it right now.
This absolutely isn't true. Data on unsubscriptions is aggregated and reported on, with summaries going far up the managerial hierarchy.

Some product manager/data analyst is going to submit a weekly report on unsubscription numbers that shows a huge spike, and they'll have to provide some qualitative explanation for why it happened. That is exactly why this box on the unbsub screen exists, and what people write in here will filter up to executives.
So you and me are on the support team?

Damn, i must be owed some paychecks!
It‚Äôs a screenshot from twitter...
Do you really think they don't care about losing subscribers left and right? Accounts being deleted? And the negative publicity all of it is causing? 

Sure it may change nothing, but it also may change everything. To say they don't care about it as all is far from true.
Big Dick Energy
Probably his job. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd be too happy about it.
He‚Äôs not an employee he quit decades ago and engaged in several failed ventures. Now he just trolls blizz constantly with stupid stunts like this.

I like him but let‚Äôs be honest he‚Äôs a big troll.
I will accept an apology in the form of a complete and total reversal on their ruling toward Blitzchung, IN ADDITION to a FREE Hong Kong Protest Mei skin for all Overwatch players. If they do that, I accept their apology, since THAT will get them banned in China and show where their allegiances really lie. They won't though, lets be perfectly honest.
I said something like that to my friends. I just want Blizzard to fix this so I won't have to never play WoW again.
Hate to be the bearer of bad news , but Blizzard isn't gonna fall. After this move, they are completely secure in China. For every one employee that walks out on them, ten will be there ready to take a job at Blizzard, and be morally flexible too. Blizz may lose a few hundred or even several thousand subscribers here in the West, but they already showed China is more important to them anyways.
Blizzard is dead to me , even if they come out and apologize now it doesn't take away their initial course of action.
Corporations are like animals, we need to train them and reward them for doing the right thing. Rewarding them for going back on this after punishing them for doing it in the first place would send a very clear message to other corporations considering bowing to the demands of China.

Being on the side of freedom and democracy needs to be profitable or they won't do it.
WoW has been really going downhill for a while, in terms of community/playerbase if not gameplay. If this is what dethrones it as a top MMO, then let it be so.
It was suppose to give Bliztchung a sense of pride and accomplishment!
Bro a flip to deciding that it‚Äôs more profitable to support HK than China would be a paradigm shift in world power balance, especially HK.
Who will pay? You want to punish all people in China who play and enjoy Blizzard games?
Our only option is to make it financially NOT worth it.

Also, I would love to see FARA investigation.
That's the crux of the issue that I've had to explain to some people who really just want to be right so they don't have to think about quitting playing: no, you can't just not buy everything that comes from China. But you specifically don't have to buy from a company that actively censors free speech in order to please China. Blocking Hong Kong messages/imagery and deleting discussion about it is tantamount to propagandizing China. They are making sure that people don't find out about what is happening in Hong Kong, and the less the world knows about it, the more likely those people are going to fail. These actions could potentially cost lives.
IMO the path to redemption would be as some said, a pro-HK Mei skin, or some other clear unambiguous statement. The point is, it's no longer enough to be 'neutral' as a company, do something that will risk or guarantee the CCP will ban them, that risks their oh so precious Chinese income. THAT will prove they're done putting cash above human rights. When they take action that could actually cost them something.
> There needs to be some path to redemption for companies that fuck up or no one will ever bother trying to redeem themselves.

This doesn't bother me. I'd be more than happy to see Blizzard stop doing business in the US entirely after this debacle. If they'd released anything worth playing in the last 20 years it'd be different. But they're basically a chinese mobile game developer at this point that makes token updates to their twilighted MMO and shooter.
They declared a war the on humanity when they stifled human rights. Punish and push out those who made the decision but there won't be a bringing them to our side.
I actually agree with this. Thisll probably be what happens
I think you're lost
Unfortunate but unavoidable
More than 50% in the Americas, 33% everywhere else and 14% in China.
I just saw something on youtube so take it with a grain of salt , could of been BelluarGaming 

anyways he said over the next few years that the  Chinese PC gamers will grow to equal more in number than the entire population of the USA...

so i think that explains blizzards shitty actions
Mostly US, BUT the vast majority of their investors are Chinese. So most of their money is coming from China which is why they're willing to take this dive. They'd rather appease their investors than maintain their integrity
Nah, he can take all his stupid gamergate and SJW hot takes, shove it all on the firefall bus, and drive away forever for all I care.

Also, take a look at this: https://old.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/4l1agq/what_buying_back_the_firefall_ip_really_means_by/
pretty good article [here](https://www.techinasia.com/firefall-mark-kern-sacked-the9-story) about him
I'm just tired to see him jump on every occasion to heal his frustration.
Having a common enemy may help heal the divides in modern day politics
True but Kern is pushing his own agenda in this rather than being about the HK protesters, which is telling.
I'd like if this was a chance for blizz subscribers to start paying attention to human rights abuses on american soil as well.

But I doubt it
Nah he's a disgusting opportunist, i can't say i "agree" with him on anything
This came up in a highlight thing and I just remember seeing several tweets from him after trying to promote his new game to people commenting.

&#x200B;

Like, good on you Mark for doing the right thing but let's not pretend there wasn't an underlying motive.
He's a clinical narcissist who abuses employees under him and comes out of the woodwork to make every Blizzard backlash about himself. He's a piece of shit.
Firefall was the best worst game I ever played. Like someone made a decent game and then let a nine year old loose in the editor for six months.
Cancel culture in a nutshell
Cancel culture.
Liberals think everything right of crazy is alt-right.
I'd also like better examples than someone calling out the SJW movement, as there exist several concepts as to what the SJW movement is exactly, and some of those concepts are absolutely not worth defending.

If that is alt-right to people, then I don't know what I am, because I'm certainly not alt-right, but the SJW movement has brought such toxicity to the world that I can't support that either.

Yeah, he's in one political camp, and he referred ina snide manner to people in the other camp. 

Ghastly, isn't it?
Well, he used the phrase "right to have sex". Ya know, that thing that is *supposed* to be a mutual decision between consenting adults, and that no one is *supposed* to be owed.

That's gonna be a hard YIKES from me, dawg. Tells me a lot about a person, that one thing.
Has he recanted those tweets?
Definitely don't Venmo this guy any beer money, haha!
That's pretty revisionist. The Verge video was *long* after all that mess. Like literally four years or so after. Affiliate links are *still* a thing.

Hm. Technically a broken clock is right more often than one that's 5 minutes slow.
A broken digital clock is never right tho
Lol stop using a piece of string with a dot in the middle to define your life you jabroni.

You should have differing positions depending the topic. Not some stance where you just align with a section and agree with all of it.
Can you provide a link in a pm or comment, I'm not aware of this. I only know him through what I've seen of him and some other devs posts talking with or about him on Twitter.
The people like him were always going to stand up against this. It's the people like the one you're responding to that are acting out of character in doing the right thing.
Literally no one is saying that.
Yeah we aint really agreeing if this dude supports someone that would do the same kind of shit in America
I know **I‚Äôd** want to know who this guy is, so I tried to let like-minded people know. That‚Äôs all that‚Äôs happening here.

I think Blizzard is being reprehensible and I certainly hope as many people as possible agree, Mark included.
To bw honest his role and importance is abit overblown and it feels like he's just pushing to get his name out there and be relevant again
So Chris Metzen pays a sub too... According to you. 

&#x200B;

That's so cute that you believe that.
You should link the full one
Big if true.
> they'll have to provide some qualitative explanation for why it happened. 

Oh...I think they'll know, lol.
They (along with many other traitorous company's) only care about money and China with their 600+ million gamers to Americas 160 million or so cant compete. they really don't give a shit what Americans think. The main problem with capitalism is GREED.
Oh so something that Blizzard doesn't have?
More like Limp Dick Energy, am I rite? I'll just go away now.
Don't forget compensation for the Taiwanese casters who were publicly fired for doing their jobs.
Their allegiances don't automatically switch after that. They HAD to come back here. They still chose China first. 

They Need To Pay.

That skin would be amazingly shameful to them haha. Great idea
> a FREE Hong Kong Protest Mei skin for all Overwatch players

Okay now we're over-reaching...  Blizzard does not need to take the side of Hong Kong, but they should not be taking the side of China.  A company shouldn't be expected to 'take sides' and should be neutral in politics like this.

This is an issue of the people vs government.  Companies shouldn't be involved in this issue in the same way that companies *shouldn't* (they are, but they shouldn't) be involved in politics.
About the worst way you can handle this as it just gives Blizzard the impression that any outrage can be swept under the rug with the right incentives.
Lol this will fizzle out when they announce Diablo 4 (especially if it has a D2 vibe). They don't need to apologize at all.

Nothing they do now will change things for me. I am not looking for some empty apology that they are forced to make to try to win people back.

I am more interested in seeing Blizzard punished to the full extend and not recover, so other companies will think twice before bending the knee. This is much bigger than just Blizzard.
That skin would be so popular. I don‚Äôt play overwatch and I would buy that if the money was partially donated to helping HK protesters.
So to people of china "until you are willing to die in fire squads no games for you"?
I will accept nothing but a split from Activision and suits getting fired with little to no severance pay
>a FREE Hong Kong Protest Mei skin for all Overwatch players

Don't encourage them to do this, they'll event-lock it for nine wins.
my thoughts as well. i‚Äôm pretty upset over the loss of wow in my life (dumb maybe but oh well) so i really hope blizzard takes the correct steps in fixing this - i even said as much in my cancel sub box.
Was exactly my thought too. They threw away 800 employees for a short term gain to keep shareholders impressed.

A few low level staff leaving means nothing to them. There'll be plenty more passionate naive people to replace them. 

Not to mention, losing a small amount of customers in the west in the short term, since give it a week or a month and it'll be forgotten. Compared to losing their $1 billion revenue from Chinese market instantly if China was to ban all their games.

Only Bobby Kotick's Activision-Blizzard and the quest for ALL the money, and then the money that doesn't exist beyond that.

Such is the AAA industry.
All of the Asian markets (SK, Japan, China, Australia) are 12% of their revenue. They absolutely need the Americas/EMEA markets.
So Blizzard can be that Chinese company making Chinese mobile games censoring the shit out of everything they do at the whim of the CCP, and any developer with self respect or a good reputation will work elsewhere, and they will lose relevance to anybody who wants to play on a screen bigger than a postage stamp. 

That's an agreeable conclusion. It doesn't have to end with Blizzard ceasing to exist. I mean, even Atari still exists in some form.
We have a trade war with China that isn't likely to end any time soon. This will be in the news cycle forever.
I mean, you've obviously been very active and have been a dedicated whale to their games for quite a while. You've been inactive for over a month, and now came back to post this. 

Prior to that, I can't find a single post in any Blizzard subreddit in the past 7 months.
It's a shame because the game is literally just about to properly start going uphill again, at least in my eyes. And I am very curious about the next expansion, which I was/am going to use to judge if the WoW team has learned from BfA.
Yeah retail WoW is pretty bad, but Classic only came out a month ago and probably got a few million subs off of it, which definitely boosted their numbers up a alot.
Let us be honest; WoW really hasn't been a "Top MMO" by anything other than sheer, raw hangers-on for a while now. Hell, I bet if we discounted all the Chinese, Russian and Korean multi-boxers + bots they wouldn't even have the raw numbers anymore. 

Since Warlords WoW has a been a shambling abomination kept moving and relevant only be sheer inertia alone - its been an inferior product and service for a long time now. Inferior to FFXIV, Guild Wars 2, even ESO.

Sunk Cost Fallacy has been Blizzard's biggest ally for a long time now.
Yep. Looks like wow killer will not be classic either. It's Blizzard themselves.
That will be an unpleasant by-product despite what happens and what I say. That was perhaps some harsh wording on my part. Apologies. But Blizz is going to come crawling back to the non Chinese audience. The Chinese are only 12% of their audience for all their games combined. They would rather get the 88% isn't it. 

Diablo: Immoral is clearly what drove them to do what they did. The Chinese have the largest mobile game audience because most of those that have jobs use public transport for 1-5 hours a day and majority of them use this time to play their mobile games. The number of those is estimated to be 300 million. Imagine what income flux it would be if just 10 million of them bought the game.
Why do I care what a bunch of pro-fascist Chinese gamers want? They support a dictator. They're lucky it's not the pre-nuclear age or we'd have marines flying the US flag over Beijing by now.
I think most of us could not possibly care less. We're far more interested in the sovereignty of our own nations, nations where freedom of speech and freedom of expression are sacred and expected, than what videogames some brainwashed drones in China are playing.
Well you can‚Äôt since China is Blizzards biggest source of income.
Some clear unambiguous statement reconfirming commitment to western values and human rights would be nice, yes. Please not an overwatch skin though... that seems like too rapid a turnaround to he sincere and kind of cash-grabby. Like ‚Äúhey guys heard you were outraged, did you hear about our game overwatch? Go buy it and get our free apology skin!‚Äù

Let them donate to the protesters or smth instead lol.
Its not so much about blizz than the 100 other media and game companies in the exact same boat trying to decide whether to try and get back in the us and wests good graces. Bringing them back into the fold strengthens our hand in the long run.
Their only thing I've played since 2014 is wow vanilla, and I see no reason why I wouldn't play once again on a private server. I already payed for their game back in 2005
Nope
Apparently the 14% includes more countries than just China
Would you please provide a source for this?

All I have been able to find is Tencent‚Äôs 5% investment and misinformation about China being the largest source of revenue for Blizzard currently.
It will take you a while to realize he was always right about everything, but it's ok.
So this is the company he got fired from because he refused to sell out to China, huh...
Wow. I mean when he comes up in my suggestions on Twitter he usually seems to be acting the part of the jerk/seemed somewhat full of himself but I didn't think it was this bad.
Did you just really use SRD as an argument in your favor?
That and his behaviour overall
I've had passing fantasies about an alien invasion uniting us, but it turns out all we really needed was China
how? and what's his agenda?
Right? Cops are murdering people here in the US in cold blood, some people are having to pay tens of thousands of dollars just to stay alive, and wages arent keeping up with inflation. I know it's worse in other places, but we still have so much that we need to work on here in the US
Yep, I did like the 100 or 150 kickstarter cause I loved what I was seeing... then epic failure ensued.
Yep, all Liberals think the same way.

That's a big part of the problem.  Some people hear "social justice" and think it's a catch all term for everything good in the world. Other people hear the term "social justice" and think it references the folks who scream at white people for having dreadlocks and who want to ban the word 'bossy'.   I'm familiar enough with Mark Kern's political rambling to know he's talking about the latter in quotes like that, but some people won't realize it.
Alt-right used to have a clear concise meaning. Now that meaning has been kind of muted by the overuse of it. Any time someone has an opinion on something that isn't fully progressive or is outside whatever arbitrary line that was drawn in the sand people sling it like crazy. Its getting to the point where its just a thing you say to someone who disagrees with you online.

Its disappointing because it allows actual scumbags to hide in that circus.
SJW was originally coined by people on the **left** to describe those who exploited social justice for self-serving reasons: social justice posers, bullies and crazy fanatics. 


However, it unfortunately became coopted by the right (starting with GamerGate), to the point that leftists rarely use the term, even if they're critical of the kind of behavior it describes.
I don't know, you could say the same thing about love. "Everyone has the right to be loved." I think that's a good notion to have. Replacing that with sex doesn't make it rapey, it just places it in a more lewd context.

Rights are pretty much made up anyways. When you get down to it, they don't actually exist. You can claim a right to anything, but it'll never be objectively true. No one is really guaranteed anything but death. Hopefully that's not too dark to end this comment on, but you get my point.
Should he have to?
I got that reference!
Yes and that's honestly a huge part of why it was such a shitstorm. That used to be part for the course. That and constant high marks for bad games from certain uber publishers like EA.

Also affiliate links are legal and ethical. The problem was sites like Kotaku and Polygon hiding them with no disclaimer.

Nobody really gives shitty games like dragon age 2 goty or goty class scores anymore. Not a problem with one outlet because opinions differ but when every major reviewer gives a shitty EA game a 90+ while everyone else completely hates it it's obvious what's happening.
Seriously, grow up, you're pathetic and embarrassing.
^ A little boy thinks he knows enough about politics to condemn total strangers on the basis of it.
The "right to have sex" thing might not be the best take, but if at this point you can't notice something has gone very wrong with the far left's attitude towards whites then you either started using the internet yesterday or you must be a bit of a leftist radical yourself. I don't care at all what you think of me.
Depends on how it's broken.  It still could be.
It eventually will be
You heard the "Its Small Brain Time" alarm and boy did you ever answer it.
 [https://www.techinasia.com/firefall-mark-kern-sacked-the9-story](https://www.techinasia.com/firefall-mark-kern-sacked-the9-story)
Just look up the Firefall debacle.

Million dollar bus, by a well known company, that has a TV show, and still shows that shit in their intro.
Does it really matter? I read his story and its on point.  It could be anyone from the inside who understands the dirty business practices. It was actualkly crazy to see because I just posted almost the exact same thing in another Blizz group I am in. The part that especially hurts was the part about how he never thought Blizzard of all companies would do this. I said that exact same thing. Thats why I invested in them. I believed in the company and its core values. Its core values have proven to be shit. And now I am going to pay for it.
uhh, no. Saying this dude didn't get a life long subscription doesn't mean no one ever possibly could have. He didn't say shit about metzen.
They do. It's just in their mouths instead.
they have small dick energy
An excellent point that slipped past my mind, complete and total reversal on the ruling towards the casters as well.
They weren't doing their jobs since they gave a platform to someone making political statements that would directly hurt Blizzard their revenue.
The point of a boycott isn't to punish for the sake of punishment, it's to get them to change their ways. If some of us don't go back after they meet our demands, we're encouraging them to just double down on the original move.

That said, I do think that our "demands" should be more than just a reversal of this decision. They need to make a serious gesture in which they demonstrate they will never censor players or employees to appease China again.
>Their allegiances don't automatically switch after that. They HAD to come back here. They still chose China first.

the best way to do that IMO is force them to choose between the Chinese Market and the rest of us 

If they reverse the decsion and release a statement that says they will never do this again, China will do to them what they are doing to the NBA

a fitting punishment , they dont get to take our money and enjoy our liberal values at the same time as they suck chinese dick

forcing them to choose one or the other is tshe outcome we want

We make it so choosing us gets them banned in China , rock and a hard place
They would pay. You think China would just ignore that?
I know its not the case because im sure there have been political things said before... but what if its not that they chose china but prefer to not be an outlet for political opines of any kind? Ie im not a Trump fan but if a player yelled impeach trump i n the same way i wouldnt appriciate that either.. i wonder if they would do the same in regards to punishment? I guess they would have it more clearly in their TOS. The longer they say nothing the worse it really gets
No, this isn't overreaching, the problem is they DID take a side, the side of China, now the only way to fix it is to reverse course. If they never got involved in the first place I would 100% agree with you, but we don't live in that world. Just like if you don't murder someone you don't get in trouble for murder and have to pay the price, if you don't submit to authoritarian regimes that violate human rights then you don't have to prove you're not on their side. They failed to do so, now they must prove they aren't on the side of authoritarian regimes.
You mean an incentive that gets them banned in China? Yeah, that's good enough to sweep it under the rug pal. If you don't give them something to do to be forgiven then they won't bother trying to change.
I don't think you understand.   A Hong Kong protest Mei skin would end them in China.
> I am more interested in seeing Blizzard punished to the full extend and not recover, so other companies will think twice before bending the knee. This is much bigger than just Blizzard.

I will post my reply from another comment:

This is how regimes like China rule. It's totalitarian. You are not allowed to make a mistake. You are not allowed to deviate from the norm and later come to realize you were wrong. The moment you deviate, you're dead.

Nobody cares about a change of heart because you won't be around for long enough to have it. This rule of fear is a prime driving force behind social oppression.

With the attitude that no matter what a company does after a screw up, it has to die and rip the thousands of employees down with it for a decision that they don't even support, then you are showing signs of being very susceptible to the extremist mentality that can make or break totalitarian governments.

There *can* be a totalitarian government about democracy that would be oppressing people with fear in a different way.
Pretty much, yeah. If you're going to support an authoritarian regime that is suppressing speech globally and violating the human rights of its citizens in actual concentration camps, we as a freedom loving democratic society shouldn't be catering to your wants. Stop being a shill for China.
It seems you are confused.

Activision and Blizzard are different entities and has no influence over eachother. What you probably meant was Activision Blizzard, which is their parent company.
That's only true if their more senior and high end talent doesn't up and leave. If project leads and senior devs start leaving. That's going to have a crippling impact on the company.
You're right, but China has the power to block Activision from their marketplace.

You can't say that for the western markets, here it is a user by user decision.

So how many are really going to boycott, and for how long will they do it?

They know our attention span is short and this will all be forgotten soon enough, but not soon enough to save the embarrassment for Blizzcon.

ETA:

Yes I'm sure many will permanently boycott Blizzard for this, but something tells me the $$$ lost on the western market will not be more than Activision losing access to the Chinese market.  And that right there will explain everything Activision does with respect to this.

I would be shocked if Activision does the "right" thing here, but I'm willing to be pleasantly surprised.
Well I believe that I don't have to be a big whale or an active reddit poster for my voice to matter. I'll vote with my dollars and every dollar counts.
BFA has been good for the last couple patches. It started out trash, but now it's like really good, *too good.* It was hard to unsub/uninstall.

Next expansion is going to be fire if it carries over, but if they want to play stupid games, I am not even going to watch Blizzcon, let alone pick up the exp or play overwatch or overwatch 2.
And WC3 getting a burst of players with reforged too... really hope Blizzard executives remedy this situation cuz I‚Äôd love to play their games again, sigh
I've heard Legion was great, not sure about BFA. But I logged on during a free week or something and Orgrimmar was nearly dead, even with the whole battlegroup thing. Just isn't the same anymore.
Yeah, but Classic came out a month ago and garnered probably a few million more subs which puts it far above any other MMO at the moment.
Y'know what?

That's a really good point.
Some might say that the **REAL** WoW killer was inside them all along
Trust nobody, not even yourself
I'm pretty sure that's been the general sentiment for many years now.
I saw in another thread that it's east Asia overall that's around 12% but that China is only 5% of that. I don't know how accurate all of that is, though.
Living in a country and agreeing with its politics are two different things.
>They support a dictator.

That kind of undermines what it means to be a dictator. It's less "support" than "obey lest you suffer the consequences".
...you do realize the US NFL just did essentially the same thing by unofficially banning Kapernick for protesting black murders by police officers right? And that‚Äôs a situation where consumer pressure literally pushed the business execs to do so and stop black players from nonviolent protest
No its not. They make around 5% from China.
lol what
China has made blizzard very little money dude.
[deleted]
Yep. That's all of Asia. China accounts to much less than that, about 5%.
Blizzard 2018 annual report. If you need more clarification of the Blizzard-China relationship here's an interesting quote from there as well:

>"A deterioration in relations between either us or the United States and any country in which we have significant operations or sales, or the implementation of government regulations in such a country, could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including economic sanctions, that could have a negative impact on our business. For instance, to operate in China, all games must have regulatory approval. A decision by the Chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in China in the future could have a negative impact on our business. Additionally, in the past, legislation has been implemented in China that has required modifications to our products. The future implementation of similar laws or regulations in China or any other country in which we have operations or sales may restrict or prohibit the sale of our products or may require engineering modifications to our products that are not cost-effective, if even feasible at all, or could degrade the consumer experience to the point where consumers cease to purchase such products. The Chinese game approval procedure was suspended from March 2018 until January 2019 and, due to the large number of pending applications, it remains uncertain as to if and when our new products will be approved for release in China. Further, the enforcement of regulations relating to mobile and other games with an online element in China remains uncertain, and further changes, either in the regulations or their enforcement, could have a negative impact on our business in China."

Tl;dr Blizzard is afraid that the Chinese government will revoke Blizzard's right to sell their games in China. This means that Blizzard has to maintain it's the relationship with China not only to keep it's Tencent/Chinese investors happy but American investors as well who know how important the Chinese market is for Blizzard.
lol
I do not know if this is /r/BoneAppleTea or not
Any time Blizzard does an oopsie Kern tries to use it to grab any relevancy he can, he tries to make it about him.

When somebody accuses a person of being alt-right, it's worthwhile to ask "Why are they alt-right, and not regular right?" to see if the person actually has an answer.
No one has a right to anyone's emotional or physical energy. Ever. At all. Under any circumstances.

That's not really up for debate.
GG is the reason "who gives a shit what game journos think" became common sense. Even people that hate the movement will laugh uproariously at the idea of taking RPG or Kotaku seriously.

Oh I remeber that game being pretty bad. His reported attitude back then is pretty awful, I'm surprised he's working on WoW classic. He must've learned some restraint but going to take whatever he says with a grain of salt going forward.
Well yeah it doesnt really matter since he is still at this very moment contributing to a good cause but i just find it weird how his name is suddenly a big deal
He literally said this: " As long as you are an employee, you don't.have to pay a wow sub, but since he has been long gone, he is subject to a subscription like any of us. "

&#x200B;

So based on what he said, Metzen pays a sub.
They have a tiny one in their mouth, but China's pocket is full of money.
Yeah, if we don't go back after a reasonable effort to fix it on blizzard's part, it just shows that the remaining player base is boycott proof and blizzard can be as pro china as they want with no fear of further repercussions.
I dont think you understand. Blizz might as well move everything to China now. They committed treason, there is only one punishment for treason. They literally called China ‚Äútheir country‚Äù on Twitter in Mandarin. There is no statement more treasonous. They can rot forever.
Yeah. When I cancelled my sub I urged them to reverse the decision. If they make a meaningful change I will come back.
> If some of us don't go back after they meet our demands, we're encouraging them to just double down on the original move.

Exactly. 

But getting to the point where timing will start to matter. The longer it takes the less likely people will be to go back
I think overwatch is already banned in China. Not sure if thats true but i saw a post which said it was. 

They are already banning players left and right. Some people were banned for 1000 years.... Such ridiculous bans. Their accounts are banned until 3019 october.
Then we should punsih people for just living in china then?  I mean what did the 600 million chinese gamers do that was worth a punishment.  Not line up to die?
I don't think China is going to ban them for toning down their punishment to something more reasonable, though they sure as hell have made it harder on themselves now.  They might take some heat there, but they're taking heat here, and China is a much smaller portion of their market.
[Sadly....](https://twitter.com/Aspharon/status/1181997373393907712)

This is also not a political belief fyi, it's a human rights violation. There is (or there should not be) politics when it comes to HUMAN RIGHTS.
Blizzard gave in to China's demands, and now to make up for it they have to flip on their decision and make China their enemy AND give in to fans demands and give them free shit?  So you just want Blizzard sucking the dick that benefits you.

Being pissed off at Blizzard is totally fair and reasonable.  *Demanding they give you shit* because they fucked up is not.  

If Blizzard issued a public apology to the winner and restored his winnings, apologized to the casters and gave any financial restitution they are owed, and publicly stated their stance "protecting Chinese interests" was wrong, that should be good enough.  They don't owe you, me or anyone other than the tornament winner and those casters anything.
What you said makes a lot of sense and is certainly more kind and moral.

But in the end, corporations almost never face any drastic consequences and are not afraid to continue being evil.

And when our opposition (China) commands such high levels of compliance, and is willing to go all in or bust to get their way, I don't think half measures are enough to sway companies to our side.

In reality, I accepted and understand that this will fizzle out just like everything else. But I DO wonder what it'd be like if they do face such severe consequences.
This isn't one mistake blizzard fell off years ago. You could argue StarCraft 2 or cataclysm were their first signs of disconnect from players and they started making worse and worse decisions. This is the last straw.
So not wanting chinese citizens who are just surviving to have more shit thrown their way is shilling for CCP?  How insane of an opinion is that.
The chief financial officer reports to Bobby Kotic, and Bobby Kotic alone.  We've seen reports from Blizzard employees about the state of their weekly meetings about how they need to cut costs.

Activision is the bigger company in the relationship, and they absolutely have influence over Blizzard.
That's a very fair point. Ultimately its on us to stick to our guns. But I'm afraid many won't.
Personally, I wouldn't go that far. Patch 8.2 made the expansion a lot better for me, but it doesn't save the expansion. Patch 8.3 does sound right up my alley.

I have said from the start that BfA could end up shedding it's title of worst expansion so far, though. But it has a few irreconcilable decisions that will always bug me, and the big one is how they butchered the story. So much of it *could* make sense if the story was told better, and a lot of the story *does* make more sense if you read the books and short stories. But how the non-Forsaken Horde went along with Sylvanas for so long is absolutely something that will be a black spot in the Warcraft lore for me.

But still, let's hope the next one is good, and that Blizzard has done enough to fix this absolutely embarrassing display of priorities.
> but now it's like really good, too good

Have you seen the 8.3 beta leaks? Because the store has pretty much gone to hell with this xpac.
They said that about BFA, if it was as good as Legion, etc.  Blizzard isn't good at making WoW anymore.
Legion was great to many, shit to.. also many. I loved it. BfA has been shit for a staggering amount of people right up until patch 8.2, when a decent number of people were mostly okay with the expansion. The next patch sounds great too, and the WoW team seems to have really taken a lot of the complaints to heart.

But since I can't trust videogame developers/publishers, I want to see the next expansion to see them deliver on their promises. As for Orgrimmar being dead, I can't say much about that. It makes sense, because Orgrimmar isn't the hub of the expansion. Even so, there are plenty of people in Stormwind on my cross-realms. You can't judge the state of the game too much by looking at capitals that aren't the focus of the expansion.
nostalgia is a hell of a drug
Maybe the real WoW killer was the business partners we made along the way
I still talk to my old crew and they still play a good bit and tell me how much better it's gotten since Cataclysm. It seemed like the game was maybe improving, but to me it seemed like they were just bending over backwards to cater to super casuals. Like, not being able to meticulously tweak my spec just how I like it is a pain in the ass.

Ultimately though, I logged on in Orgrimmar and it was only kind of busy counting players across the whole fuggin' battlegroup. Back in the day it would be packed with just the server pop. Also I set up a picnic table and nobody joined me.
Yeah. But no one could have imagined it going down this way. It's true fucking colours exposed. Well I guess that could be said of a corporate company since most of them are money mongers.
You might be right since different sites claim to say their version is gospel. But i found this stat to be most commonly mentioned so i went with it. Also chinese wow players contributrd the highest sub profit with almost 1/3 of the wow population ever to be chinese.

Apologies if im wrong.
When the Chinese people stand up and demand freedom, then I'll listen. Until then, they can all fucking pound sand.
You realize blizzard is owned by Activision right?
im still wondering how is the number so small? i still remember the news stories about the chinese wow gold farmers
It definitely was
He needs a behavior overhaul
He's definitely a "oh btw I helped make world of warcraft 15 years ago" kind of guy.
so he shouldn't have said anything \[publicly in this case\]?

Doesn't that make your list, like, really long?
What about the other employees who walked out? Dont shift the focus
they won't... or they'll just kneejerk call you a racist.
That‚Äôs the thing. Everyone who calls themselves conservative is automatically labeled alt right.
Saying that doesn't make it true. I could just as easily say the opposite and then say "that's not really up for debate" and I'd have made the same baseless argument that you just did.
Wheres the rape?
His side of the story.   https://twitter.com/Grummz/status/1181738905051123713
I dont know the real truth but i've been reading his twitter quite alot for the pass 2 years and he seems like a decent person
Nah just several statements from verified former employees. Witness statements are used as evidence in legal trials, but you don't count that as evidence? I bet even video proof wouldn't be enough for you, the only proof you would be fine with is seeing it in person.
Hes not on WoW Classic. He just worked on Vanilla. There is a difference.

Hes doing the 'spiritual successor' to Firefall. Worked well the first time. (EM-8R or something.)
I agree.
You bring a really interesting counterpoint. Bearing in mind the information I shared is what I have gathered over the years, and from looking at their benefits when browsing for jobs on their site, I stand by what I stated. That said, I would be inclined to think Metzen, Morhaime and some of the other more iconic people might be treated differently. After all, he still does voice over for Thrall and likely has connections with plenty of people there, so much so he also attended BlizzCon after having retired.

Now, if there is any evidence to the contrary, please do share. I will gladly look over it and change my stance. Take care.
They can move to China. Its a Chinese company now.
No they didn't. First of all, that wasn't even Twitter, it was Weibo. Secondly, it wasn't even from Blizzard it was from Netease which is a Chinese game company. But spreading lies fits your agenda better I guess.
Definitely. Also, what happens if the Mei thing succeeds and China bans them anyway? It's a very awkward position since they'd then come back to the west, but clearly not of their own volition.
China actually did reprimand the NBA for slightly backtracking and has still stopped supporting the houston rockets.

They really are that petty.
Between this, the NBA, and the Trade War it's highly likely we'll be treating China like the Soviet Union going forward. And rightfully so. We never should have propped up a communist regime.
Yeah thats nuts. And youre right ill agree its not political. Poor choice of words on my part. Im assuming(hoping?) the division that wrote that is seperate from the NA division. Lack of response is prettttyyyyy damning tho
> They don't owe you, me or anyone other than the tornament winner and those casters anything.

Depends on if they want that guys money. If he deems it necessary as a customer, then they do owe it to him, if they want his business. Both sides are free to walk away.
Kotick is CEO of Activision Blizzard not of Activision.
What changed in 8.2 and what will change in 8.3?
When the Chinese people stand up and demand freedom, they get massacred. There are a number of these incidents documented, most notably Tienanmen square. There are probably more that the Chinese government succeded in hushing up before information got out
Yes what is your point, we are having a discussion about something completeing different than what you posted. I think you're confused where you are
Because chinese wow gold farmers steal western accounts mostly as it's the most profitable way to farm gold. Plus in current WoW gold is pretty meaningless and the WoW token really put a damper on gold selling as well
Yeah, you aren't ever going to 'win an argument' with somebody on the internet, but if that's all they can manage, everybody will see the truth.
Yeah, I haven't changed my political views much since the 90's, and somehow in that time I've been like 10 different things.
"right to have sex"

i downvoted you. however, i did not downvote you because of your opinion or statement. i downvoted you due to your willful ignorance of the purpose of protest.
FWIW, NetEase controls *all* operations in the Asia-Pacific region; they ran the tournament, cut the tournament video feed, and made the call to ban Blitzchung... but who the hell cares about facts when there's outrage to be had?

ATVI could fight back against their own publishing partner, but say goodbye to eastern markets, a third of their revenue stream, and likely several employees/future projects as a result of profit loss.
That was an official Blizzard account managed by Netease that released that statement so if Blizzard doesn't support that statement then they need to say something. I'll wait. \*crickets\*
The NBA backtracked off all formal punishments though right?  I feel most of us here would be fine with a situation where a fine or something still happens.
All the lackeys are so anxious to prove themselves to the party there's no room for compromise.

I bet Xi is shitting his pants. All these people who didn't care about China will be watching TV when he rolls his tanks into Hong Kong, and he'll get to build his totalitarian state with a lot less money.

I wouldn't be surprised if we ended up recognizing Taiwan and formalizing our defense treaty.
8.2 added the Mechagon and Nazjatar zones, which offer a decent bit of content to work through. It also unlocked all Azerite traits on Azerite gear by default, instead making the Heart of Azeroth kinda like an artifact necklace, but with a glyph system instead of a trait system. Meaning you can go out and unlock abilities and passives to put onto the necklace. They also added a kind of deterministic loot, though with its own flaws and criticisms.

8.3 will add assaults in Uldum and the Vale of Eternal Blossoms with N'zoth's minions. There will also be a feature that is sort of like the Deaths of Chromie content, except you can do it with 1-5 players. There will also be a shitload of currencies with which you can buy what you want to buy, though I don't know if it'll be like the loot mentioned above, or if it will truly be deterministic. Ion Hazzikostas has also spoken about possible changes coming to titanforging, though they're still discussing this internally. 

That's the important bits. Of course, 8.2 had the Azshara raid and a mega-dungeon like Karazhan, and 8.3 will have the Ny'alotha raid. Oh, and Wrathion will finally return. And immediately offer us a quest to get a new legendary cloak.

But the TL;DR of the changes to the WoW team's design philosophy obviously lie in giving us a way to more easily get loot we want and need, and in at least discussing titanforging, which we've been complaining about for so goddamn long now.
Then they lost and i have no sympathy for them. They‚Äôve let themselves be enslaved by ideology.
The "liberals" out there had their brains broken by Trump winning in 2016. I wish there were more level-headed people on the left like Dave Rubin and Tim Pool. I just can't deal with all the bs out there these days. Refuse to engage anyone anymore if I detect a whiff of TDS.
What fucking mental gymnastics do you have to pull to make ‚Äúright to have sex‚Äù into ‚Äúrape apologist‚Äù? 

Jesus Christ everyone has a right to sex as long as the other party involves convents. Both parties involved have a right to sex, if a person says no that doesn‚Äôt mean the other party has their right to sex taken away from them nor does it mean that person gets to rape the other. All it means is that sex is a basic biological function and a person is allowed to fucking want sex no matter what race, culture, beliefs, etc they have.

This isn‚Äôt fucking rocket science.
You so made it up.
=/= right to rape.

Anything else you want to reach for? Should i get the ladder so its easier?
So the time when Mark Kern harassed women on twitter isn't proof of him being a sad excuse of a human being? Or the time when he got banned from Twitter due to racist tweets? Or the time when he was overly sexist on Twitter? Tweets that he has since deleted but can be found through wayback machine if you want to dig a little. Yea, of course the game is dead even after the board voted him out of the company... The game was already fucked up beyond all repair due to him. Do you think a game suddenly becomes good the moment you change CEO? That's not how game development works. They spent years on that game with Mark changing the direction on a whim and the end product was shit, the board voted Mark out but the damage was already done. Let's also just ignore the fact that Mark threw away $3 million on a promotional bus that never was used and just collected dust in a warehouse. Oh and while we are on the topic of China and such, should we also ignore the fact that Mark sold out to a chinese company to try to save the company from bankcruptcy but that ultimately didn't help due to him being an incompetent CEO? 

EVERYONE that has ever worked under him says the same things about all the horrible shit he did as a CEO, all point to him being a huge douchebag. It's also funny that the only time he is ever in the spotlight is when there's a gaming controversy going on, he always tries to inject himself into everything and always runs around yelling "I WAS TEAM LEAD FOR VANILLA WOW" like that even matters anymore.
Pray tell, precicely how did you come to the conclusion that he is being willfully ignorant?
Their asian market is 12% of their revenue. China < 10%.
That was an official Blizzard account managed by Netease that released that statement so if Blizzard doesn't support that statement then they need to say something. Should we hold our breath?
Also fun fact: NetEase ran the Chinese OWL Team ‚ÄúShanghai Dragons‚Äù last year, which was infamous for going 0-40
That was a Netease account managed by Netease.
There was no formal punishment, Morey was just told to pull his tweet and apologize, which he (or someone at the NBA under his name) did. What Silvers did was claim NBA was pro-free speech after the censorship and apologies, which just upset China again. I don't think Morey has been allowed to speak his mind again, at least not on twitter like he did originally. So now the NBA has the US and China pissed, pretty bad situation all around.
>I feel most of us here would be fine with a situation where a fine or something still happens.

I think you are out of touch with how most  of us here feel. Any punishment is unreasonable, and a public apology plus a penalty are what are called for at this point.
How is not wanting to have you and your family killed being enslaved by an ideology?  I'm sure many don't agree with the government but what can they do unless they want to die for a hopeless cause?  Do you think the same for North Koreon people too?
lol, must be really easy to hold such lofty ideals. Let me guess you are between the ages of 16-25 and grew up not knowing strife?
I think what's really changed is social media. It used to be you were a liberal until you were 29-32, then you got a real job and didn't have the time or energy to argue politics with little kids.  But now that we have social media, you've got 3-4 generations in each other's faces talking about politics all at once.  

Dave Rubin didn't undergo some amazing political reformation, he just stopped being college-age.
Don‚Äôt you know the 2nd Amendment allows you to force people to give you a gun? It is the ‚Äúright to bear arms‚Äù, after all.
lmao so triggered
"right to sex" is vile incel talk. no one else says shit like this.
[deleted]
because the person he replied to explained in what i consider good enough detail why continuing to punish a company after they revert their decision is not how you enact long term change.

>Yeah, if we don't go back after a reasonable effort to fix it on blizzard's part, it just shows that the remaining player base is boycott proof and blizzard can be as pro china as they want with no fear of further repercussions.
Of *Activision-Blizzard* (the parent company) entirely yes, because that number is calculated across all sub-studios and products which market much higher in the west, though AP & China contribute significantly more revenue to *Blizzard Entertainment* (the actual studio) itself, which creates Warcraft, Diablo, Starcraft, Heroes, Overwatch, and Hearthstone.

[Source](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-fourth-quarter-and-2018-financial): Over 30%, when you look at Net Revenue divided by sub-company (Activision, Blizzard, and King individually).

Keep in mind they're also on the verge of a major new release largely aimed toward eastern audiences - while mobile games are often derided in the west, despite being extremely profitable, they're even bigger in the Asia Pacific, especially China which is a market which few western developers have managed to penetrate.
They do need to say something, but that's not the point - the point is that people should not conflate a Chinese publisher, run by the Chinese state, making a pro-Chinese statement, on a Chinese media platform, *in China*, with the western company that they have a publishing deal with.

Is it still bad for Blizzard? Certainly, but it's not like J. Allen Brack or Bobby Kotick were tweeting out "GO CHINA!", and framing it that way simply to push this preposterous narrative is disingenuous at best. As for Blizzard not supporting it, I don't think any reasonable person in their right mind thinks that Activision or Blizzard support the way the Chinese government governs their people, just like the U.S. doesn't support the way Saudi Arabia treats its people, yet continues to do business with them.

The unfortunate truth is that the cost of getting involved with *another governments* politics would be so disastrous to their business that they might as well pack up shop and start handing out pink slips, because they're all going to end up unemployed. The even more unfortunate truth is that Blizzard should have never been involved in this situation in the first place - they only are because Blitzchung **forced** them into it, which is exactly why he was banned and precisely why those rules against it exist in the first place.
NetEase runs literally *everything* related to Blizzard in the east:

* The PR
* The Teams
* The Tournaments
* The Rules
* The Prizes

**Literally everything**, because they have a licence to do so. Yet people still insist on conflating them with Blizzard Ent (the studio) or ATVI (the parent company). It'd be like if something in the shitty Game of Thrones Web Browser game was considered to be coming from GRRM himself, which is equally ludicrous.
It is a Blizzard branded account. So Blizzard needs to either de-brand that account or they need to dispute the statement by the account.
I think you‚Äôre assuming ‚Äòmost‚Äô just as much as I am.
Lmao 0 argument
Learn to express yourself like an adult if you want anybody to care what you think.



>Oh no, he "harassed" wahmen?? I mean we all know both genders get flak, but you guys seem to think women & PoC are incapable of dealing with it the way their white male counterparts do. Almost like you think of them as lesser beings or something ü§îü§î


I feel like you didn't intend for this to read as both sexist and racist but....
Pray tell, how the widely accepted punishment for treason is intended to enact long term change? Its a societal one, not one for the offender to be redeemed from.
Of course I am. As long as you are aware it's an assumption.
[deleted]
1. blizzard doing what it did is not [treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason).
2. boycotting is not a punishment for treason, never has been. punishment for [treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason) usually involves jail time.
3. i replied to you replying to someone saying how continued boycotting of a business after they corrected their error and changed their ways is not how boycotting works. (in more words than that) not anything about treason.
4. your reply was ignoring his/her whole point and snidely saying, that they can go back where they came from in essence. 
5. which is why i down-voted you and explained why, i apologize for not making that post clear enough.

does that work?
Even in this reply you establish women and PoC as the outliers and white males as the standard. There are women, there are PoC, and then there's "everyone else"? 

You're the one lumping people in to catagories, catagories of people that should really try to handle things more like white dudes.

Blizzard burning in flames, very fitting
Army here. Trashed my shit too, fuck them
Navy here. Did you piss on it afterwards?
Reddit is censoring my posts so ill put er in here. PSA if you live in the EU you have a right to request your personal data from dpo@blizzard.com! Do so!
Semper, Devil

Love,

Doc
Army vet here, thank you for your cervix debbled egg. I wonder if their Chinese market will be able to recoup not having a market anywhere else

edit: someone informed me i made a type, so i will fix it
sadly no physical copies to burn

Cancelled WOW subscription
Uninstalled WOW Classic
Uninstalled WOW
Uninstalled Overwatch

Thank you for serving our country and fighting for Americans of all races and creed. The fact that this American company is siding with the CCP and suppressing freedom of speech is beyond horrific.
Not from us am an Australian actually, but wanted to say thank you for fighting for your country
Destruction can be beautiful sometimes
The hardest decisions require the strongest wills.
Both your service and this are appreciated
American exceptionalism is a myth, the modern US mil fights against freedom not for it. Don't blind yourselves to what happened in Vietnam and Iraq. Look at the Highway of Death in the Gulf War, and tell me it was for justice; you will find yourself just as deceived as a PRC bot.
I support you fully, but I just want to make sure you know that burning the money you already spent doesn't actually hurt Blizzard. Still, the imagery is strong.
Wow, I had no idea that there were WW2 vets that were such avid video gamers. You must be a WW2 vet because no soldier since then has fought for my freedom against a threat, they've only fought for the oligarchy's profits.
Thank you!!
Fuck ya!
As a fellow veteran, I would join with you, but I already quit playing their games years ago. The actiblizz culture of shoveling out shit to sell microtransactions killed their reputation for me. Every year just reaffirms that I made the correct decision.
Sorry but what will this do? You already bought them. Blizzard has its money. 

Also buy burning the games you take away the mere chance that blizz will actually go and CHANGE.
You sir are quite a comedian. Since when US military fights for freedom (last time they did was WW2)?
But but but ... You already gave them your money. Now you are just destroying your own property which for me is kinda stupid
So have you actually done anything to help Hong Kong after posting this virtue signalling bandwagon garbage or are you just going to pretend that somehow burning boxes of Blizzard games helps anyone? You know, donated to help the cause, wrote to politicians that sort of thing?

By the way, post the aftermath. Prove this isn't photoshopped.
They already got your money dumbass
Hahaha, US marine fighting for "freedom". Keep deluding yourself, you were a pawn doing menial tasks.
'Freedom'
Fighting for freedom. Sure, bud!
aS a PrIoR uS mArInE
So you burned something you paid for that was yours. Blizzard had your money already, how does this show them?
You fought in WW2? I hope I can still game while I'm that old.
I didn't know freedom equated to killing innocent pine nut farmers
I hope that fire didn't melt all your Crayola! We need you strong out there, yes I'm Navy ( Total PoG)
Literally adding fuel to the fire.

&#x200B;

Good job!
I didn't think there was such a thing as prior Marines.
Brilliant
Horrah
The fire looks great, what were your camera settings?
Who cares?! It‚Äôs not like they are anti freedom. I‚Äôve seen the video and I cringe so hard after. You can make a point, but wear a T-shirt or do something subtle if you want to raise awareness for something. Wearing a mask and screaming like an idiot is just cringe AF, while many people are watching. 

He took a chance to see how far he can go on a spot like that and it didn‚Äôt work out for his gaming career. Shit happens. He might made his point to raise awareness, so I say it‚Äôs a solid 50/50. Stop being stupid by blaming Blizzard to take sides, while they actually didn‚Äôt take any side and promoted a neutral position.
The professional gamer they fired broke ToS 



Reevaluate the situation after checking facts if you actually care and aren't a fuckwombling karmawhore
A Marine ?

You didn't fight for freedom you clown, you fought for imperial causes and all your presidents are war criminals that should stay the rest of their lifes on jail.
Remind me, which of our recent wars were fought on behalf of freedom?
Thank you for your service.
I agree what they did was messed up but....... I don't think it's necessary to burn everything.....
Awesome guys. Love capitalism burning blizzard.
So happy I stopped playing OW 5 weeks ago, and will NEVER PLAY A BLIZZARD GAME AGAN.
Where my Air Force at *im not but just asking*
lol **US Marine**  Great!
salute from the HongKong. Blizzard will not be tolerated.
salute!
Thanks for fighting for my freedoms in california
Respect. Uninstalled all Blizzard games on my PC. Won't burn my tower though...
Would be nice if I could trash my OW shit too. Too bad my parents won't let me make a firepit in the backyard.
Blizzard all about that #SuckDongForYuan.
>Arthas funko

I'm proud son
Good job. I would do the same.
A lot of Chinese bots in this thread.
I am a Hongkoner and appreciate deeply to your action. Thank you US. Fight for freedom!
You guys are awesome! Thank you for your service.
Is this in reaction to Hong Kong events?
Tweet this at em plz
Honestly what is this about? Because this is incredible confusing?
Salute
Respect
I mean, that's cool, but they're still on your [battle.net](https://battle.net) account.
I stopped playing OW for more then a year. And I will never buy new game from them.
I kinda want to buy a used Blizzard gear just so I can do this.
Blizzard has been circling the drain for a while.
It's a beautiful picture, even without context
Where did you exactly fight for freedom? Mr. Ex Marine? Did you fight for the freedom of your own country inside your own country? No? I didn't think so. Stop the propaganda bullshit and better keep your mouth shut. We all know how America "fights for freedom" on other continents, in other countries.
I think its quite funny actually, people are angry because blizz is enforcing the punishment on him for breaking the rules.

Blizzard would 100% not have done this if he did it on his own stream or anywhere else where blizzard would not have been mentioned, reason for the ban is he did it on a blizzard sponsored stream which lead to the ban and so on.

It even says in the COC "removal from grandmaster, prize money reduced to 0 usd and a pro league ban". 

Knowing this he still did it and what do you know he got punished for it, and still people are boycotting blizzard for following their own rules.

Im not going to cancel my subscriptions or burn my physical copies and shirts because what blizzard did was not wrong, what he did was.
Not sure "prior" is very American. I smell BS (on top of all that burning plastic).
Oh no an angry army man. That will teach them.
What is it with Americans and burning products they own?

I'm not against the symbolism. Just seems like an oddly consistent American thing to do.
Taking crayon eating to a whole new level I see.
that really wasn't necessary. this is the equivalent of burning books because the publisher is an asshole, or your house to oppose your government. the only one you are hurting is yourself.
Blizzard finally joins Diablo in hell
Why not burn some books while you're on it. I bet no bad person ever in the history of the world burned books...oh wait.
"for freedom", or for oil? please don't be stupid thinking us is way better than china please
Hate to break it to you, but if you indeed served in the US armed forces you were most likely not fighting for freedom.
Did you burn your IPhone too after you took the picture?
What is wrong with people?? This action by Blizzard does not say they  support China against Hong Kong, it just says they do not permit  politics in gaming venues which is absolutely understandable. If they  allowed one instance, they will need to allow all - a pro chinese gamer  spewing stuff about Hong Kong too, some Israeli guy about Palestine and  vice versa, Trump haters, etc... Next thing you know their tournaments  would be a venue for polarizing political statements. I'm sure all this  controversy is because that particular political issue was against most  of what the western players uphold, but if it was an issue they agreed  with they would have totally understood the decision... I'm saddened to  see the west not upholding their own values and being unable to separate  emotions from sound judgement. Really pathetic and saddening. Blizzard  does not deserve all this hate for a sound decision based on a contract,  for a very perfectly reasonable reasoning. People seem to be dying to be in a situation to be self righteous, such people probably do not enjoy anything anyway... shame... Oh and before anyone says I'm from China or something - I'm Egyptian.
Photoshopped you can tell
I shot brown kids for freedom and used it for karma, upvotes to the left please üò§
Same fire pit where you burned your nikes? üòÇ
You don‚Äôt seem to mind US activity in Yemen though... do you honestly care about human rights?
Fought for... which freedom? Certainly not mine. What does being a marine have to do with this at all?
Good job brother.We must stand up to authoritarian regimes and attempts to impose it on our freedom
American politicians bought and paid for over the last 50 years. Income equality, affordable healthcare and affordable education being stripped away but this is what everyone is losing their shit over.. ?
Cringe
I personally have never met a marine who referred to themselves as a ‚Äúformer‚Äù marine. And also this photo looks super fake
This post is *very* cringy for two reason:

1. "Marine... Fought for freedom".

2. Burning shit to protest against the company whose games you had already bought and paid for. This is a lose-lose situation.
Thank you for your service in the war of 1812, sir. What was Andrew Jackson like in person?
Although I support your stance....unfortunately they already took your money. =\[ Best way would probably deleting accounts and hurt their wallet.
Hahahahahah xd people rly think that destroying their own stuff and cancelling wow subs help ? In what world are you guys living?
killing illiterate goat herders is not "fighting for freedom"
wow they really brainwashed you lol. you actually believe you fought for our freedom? thanks for taking over those oil fields and dirt huts, cant thank you enough
US marine fighting for freedom? You were fighting for american hegemony. You never had a war where you had to defend your home.
You can't hear and see anything which you don't want. What's the difference between Chinese and Americans? We are all brainwashed, but by different power.
Thank you for everything you‚Äôve done for us
Is that an iPhone? Oh, wait you should throw your bullets in there because they're made with that Chinese invention, gunpowder.
Wait lol how old are you if you fought in a war to protect American freedom? Just curious.
Navy here; meritorious conduct, marine.
This makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.
Your response is more powerful, I just uninstalled all my games. Back to Steam and the Nintendo Switch for all my gaming needs.
Prior marine? No one says prior marine. Once a marine always a marine. Unless OTH.

Edit: OTH means other than honorable discharge.
Fuck Blizzard and Fuck China!
Don't make me laugh, US military fight for freedom? No, you fight for oils and hegemony
was this taken in your off time between bombing innocent civilians in random country A and random country B?
There's nothing smart about this. All you're doing is just burning your property. You already paid for it, this just makes you look stupid lol. On top of that, you're just burning...nothing really since all those games are on your bnet account and don't need the boxes for anything. Show us deleting your shit. Not burning useless boxes.

Like all those idiots burning up their Nike shoes. Company already got paid, you just ruined your own property.

You eat too many Crayons?
how did you fight for freedom?
Mega boot farming karma in multiple subreddits, these internet points are damn tasty arent they
POST PICS OF YOUR BANNED BATTLENET ACCOUNT IF YOU ARE REALLY SERIOUS
Thank you for you service. Sadly I don't have any hard copies of any of the games or I would be doing this as well. Honestly fuck blizzard. I uninstalled everything from my system. They want to support communism on American soil they can go move there.
I'm proud
lol I love the message but I'm cracking up over here at how over-the-top some of these posts are
military are very dramatic
Plot twist: they were all empty boxes.
I r average redditor company bad I attack American company for I am angry at China. Downvote all differing opinions rawr
Fuxk the chinese government
Great!
You are good man, thank you
Lol Idc about Blizzard and I'm not about to start, but you're still burning YOUR property for karma.
The flame effects look so real!
Thank you, sir. I agree we should not support these disgusting companies! Such greed is not okay.
Idk if it will really touch them if you burn those shit you already bought it ...
Hahaha
Giving Blizzard the rest of the week to make this right before I uninstall my Blizzard games which I've been playing since I was a kid. I'm a grandmaster in HOTS, many times diamond in SC2, and played the hell out of Diablo 2 the original StarCraft, and even the mediocre Diablo 3. Corporations need to understand that morality matters. 

They won't get a single dollar or iota of support from me until they make this right. They need to:

1. Issue a strong statement in support of real free speech.

2. Remove all penalties from the Hearthstone player in question.

3. Apologize for their moral lapse. Freedom, democracy, and free speech must always be stood up for.
You did show them by burning all this plastic in this day and age, that you already bought off them...
 can someone explain the situation i‚Äôm really out of the loop
That hurts
Eat shit bootlicker
Not disregarding the action here but that diablo box in the fire looks like a solid commercial pic
Thank you for your service!!!
It's the Nike shoes all over again.
Your infantry brother up in the cold north, ditched my shit as well. Stay safe. Thank you for your service. Bravo Zulu!
I‚Äôm out of the loop, what‚Äôs the deal with everyone hating blizzard I don‚Äôt get it. Not like I play any of their games anyways, but still
"you're welcome for my service"
Boycott those cowards
US soldier fought for freedom. OK.
Very brave
wtf are you like 100 years old
No such thing as a former Marine. oorah!
I would just like to say this is now showing up under "HOT" that is all.
Oh wow TYFYS
Man they really fucked up didnt they? I bet they werent expecting this backlash. Funny, their justification for the ban is "we dont do politics over here" but the ban proves that they infact actually do politics. Ironic. They should have just closed their eyes on this one.
I deleted my blizzard account after seeing your post.
You burned your boxes!!! How about what is in the cloud? hahaha... I'm on to you.
Lmao so dramatic.
What freedom did you achieve?
I only did this figuratively.. it was a little sad- but necessary.
Respect
looks fake
Whose freedom did you fight for, and when?
Damn, I could never do that, you‚Äôre brave
As a fellow prior service Marine, stop waving your DD214 foe brownie points. Your drill instructors would cringe seeing this post.
They haven't had a product worth buying since D2 LOD, honestly.
And they will enjoy your money just as much as you will all this begged for attention "LOOK AT ME I MARINE I KISS BOOT FOR A LIVING hAHa"
Delete all your blizzard accounts. Delete all the digital copies. Quit their games.
If this were happening in your city you'd be shooting the protesters
This is photoshopped
But didn't you fck up others freedom by serving the military?

One man's freedom fighter us another man's terrorist
Just a question why you all mention your Army ranks when it doesnt even have something to do with the Blizzard Incident. Flex much?
US fought for freedom? Ahahahahah whatever bro
Not an american but I fully support this, that's an MVP act right there. ggwp.
you already paid for those games tho
Marine as well here, right there with you brother. #boycottblizzard
Just requested a refund for Warcraft 3. Was looking forward to it but it's just a game.
I‚Äôve NEVER heard a Marine refer to himself as a ‚Äúprior‚Äù Marine. They always say ‚Äúformer Marine‚Äù. Also ‚Äúwho fought for freedom‚Äù, is this r/justbootthings ?
Give them to me instead of burning them
A lot of that shit looks awfully unscathed for being in a blazing fire.  I sympathise with the message though.
good thing you didn't burn any of any of their good games (Warcraft 2-3, Starcraft, Diablo 2)
Wow !Man you did a great job.
I don't like how people are deleting their accounts and burning their games. I hate blizzard as much as the next guy but i have progress on their games, and i don't want to lose my stuff. Still tho i hate blizzard
see you in 8.3 lol
I love the image, but this is equivalent to Michael Scott crumbling up a dollar bill and saying it was totally destroyed.
Army here: All accounts deleted.
Yeah but everything is digital download now...so are you going to burn the pc too lol.
\+1M to Blizzard's Carma. Way to go, Blizzard
You mean Israel
Salute  
The world needs more people like you
I did the same thing. Good riddance.
Dude you are US marine, you arent really better than them
back in late 2008 after finding out what's Tencent was, I knew this would happened and it did happened. I just uninstalled all blizz game. now the damn problem is I pre-ordered the W3 remastered :I
Spoiler alert its just a box he kept the discs
What happend with Blizzard?
Different continent, probably different world view here, but we‚Äôre on the same page today. Just did the same thing by deleting my account with many associated games.
From an active zoomie, thanks for your service mang.
Lmao
You have the balls, i wouldnt be able to do it with something i have so many memories with.

What did blizzard do?
Thank you for your service.  


I stand with Hong Kong
I'm boycotting Blizzard now. If anyone thinks I'll change my mind, I'll just mention that I'm also boycotting French wine. 

As most of the readers here probably wasn't even born yet when this boycott started, I'll leave this link:

New titles i can agree, but i wouldnt thrash my W3 and original WoW cases. Those were made by different company and different people. Blizzard Activision is just a name for something else. RIP blizzard.
The boxes and wood don't actually appear to be burning tho, looks like Photoshop.
You are never a "prior" Marine. You ARE a Marine.
Oh yes, need to show tuis big companies we dont need them
Looks like Blizzard needs to learn what Semper Fidelis really means.
That will certainly help Hongkong
Proud of you my friend. The world stands against China and its bloodthirsty regime.
a grampa being fascinated with video games its quite rare indeed! thank you for your service soldier!
Why would you burn good games over a companies shitty decision
Woah
That is a gangsta move not gonna lie. Respect.
Almost everybody I know in the military used blizzard games as an easy way to hang out or stay in contact with friends.  I can't believe it's come to this.
Bruh moment when all your games are digital and you can't do something cool like that
Good job guys.  Keep it up.  I lay awake at night worrying if people really have enough fear over the implications of Blizzard‚Äôs actions here and what it could mean if it doesn‚Äôt go unpunished.  Other companies that have a vested interest in the Chinese economy are watching closely.  Totalitarianism doesn‚Äôt happen overnight.  It‚Äôs a slow process that sneaks up on a society and before you realize it‚Äôs happened, it‚Äôs already too late.
Burning them is a bit much IMO. Sell it on to at least recoup SOME of the losses. It's what I'm doing with my PS4 copy of Overwatch
Good shit man, I got rid of all of my blizzard games from diablo 2 onwards. We need to keep it up! What Blizzard and the chinese government are doing is wrong.
True military decisiveness. Devil Dogs!
Whose freedom did you fight for? Not America's, if you went into another country to kill other people in their homes and towns. That's just called invasion.
Who is ever a *former Marine...
You mean a marine fighting for you freedom.
This is 100% photoshopped.
This is inspiring and should be posted on r/pics r/gaming and anywhere else it won't be taken down
As long as you activated the keys on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), you don't need to physical copies right..?
Nice photoshop you got there. Easy to cash in when people‚Äôs emotions are high, you sick bastard.
Why are people trashing/burning the retail packaging?
You already paid for it tho
I enjoy the message and appreciate it, but anyone else think this looks like a bad photoshop job? Flames too perfect.. No charring on ANYTHING... No smoke.
This is fake
Altough it's not ok what Blizzard did I wouldn't burn my Games. I mean...I paid for it, it's not worth burning it because they already got the money. It shows the anger, but doesn't effect anything to boycott Blizzard.
So if you try burning your WoW CDs and the flame goes out on disc 4 do you have to start the fire all over again with disc 1?
This looks photo shopped.  Have another angle?
Just to let you know, some /r/Gamingcirclejerk jerkoff took your post and is [claiming it for their own](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/dfp8iz/as_a_prior_us_marine_who_fought_for_freedom_your/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).

EDIT: And others are spamming your post there to mock you.
Wow, that's really impressive that you did it.
Thank you for your service Marine!
Rahhh! YUT YUT!
Thank you for your service. We must all stand up for what is morally right. The core fundamental value that binds us as a nation is freedom. Remember that people in Hong Kong and mainland China are still suffering from oppression.
Thank you for your service, brother.
Respect

o7 I salute you
First: Thank you for your service,

Second: I get canceling subscriptions (which is warranted) but I never saw a point in destroying one's own property.

By all means, its your stuff do as you please but it only comes across as a virtue signal to me.
Never served personally but I have friends and family who have served. Thank you.
thank you for your service
Thank you for your service and your fighting for freedom!
Thanks for your service.
Thank you for your service.
How dare you blizzard! Bending over for communism??!  How awesome would it be to create games with complete artistic freedom of expression? Oh wait you can because you're based in countries that FOUGHT and DIED for that freedom!!!!! And you give in to communist China???? Disgusting! Move to China if you love an enslaved demographic so much! You spit in freedoms face!
More importantly, Thank you for your service. ‚úäüèº
My respect for our military grows every day.
Lol, so pathetic. It's like the fight between Napster and Metallica back in the early 2000s.
How did killing children protect anyone's freedoms? I don't see how dying for Isreal helped anyone. Unless you were in World War 2. Anything past that you just helped tyranny.
Oorah!
Respect!

Badass!! I tip my hat to you, sir. Thank you for your service.

Lol you still have all those codes on your computer all you did was burn cardboard...
It hurts looking at this since I loved Diablo 1 and 2. I want blizzard north back

Will they respond for people not living in Europe/not European citizens? Would love to know what info they have on me.
why can't i do this in canada :(
You mean China is censoring your posts.
Thank you for your what?!?
This is amazing.
Honestly i doubt they will lose everybody. Sure, a loss is a loss, but there are still the people who just want to play wow or overwatch.
Lol, if you actually think that many people care you're delusional. The vast majority don't even know about this or give a shit.   


It will blow over by Blizzcon like most of these sorts of stories. Blizzard are a business and their market in China was at stake, to think they'd choose another option here is silly.  


And I say that as someone who has been disappointed in recent Blizzard products.
Hey man!! Leave classic wow out of this.
Not by me
By whom?
This is far from the only American company bent on suppressing freedom of speech.

Of course, that doesn‚Äôt make them any less shitty.
>fighting for Americans of all races and creed

The Detroit Race Riots say hello.
I had no idea that people in HK were one of those Americans of all races. Boy, that was a shocker.
Came here looking for this comment, thanks. The US invasion of foreign countries is what creates terrorism. When the US bombs civilians, destroying their homes and killing their families, these people have nothing left to live for and want to avenge the wrongful deaths of their people. While most US soldiers are good people who want to help the world, they're mislead and lied to by the US government. They're used as pawns to further the interests of US private companies that profit from the military industrial complex and the economic damage that war causes.
Right? Now let's thank them for it
Objectivity in these affairs is not for those who fight. The hero and freedom myths of the military class and others are propagated for certain reasons favorable to rulers and the populace. Onward brave souls!
I'm sure the Viets love having a totalitarian one-party system which brutally oppresses their right to free speech. Fighting against the violent, hegemonic Communist regime in Vietnam was textbook "freedom-fighting." Look at the insanely brutal crackdowns and purges conducted by the NV after the war. That regime is essentially indefensible by anyone with a moral compass, and they contributed heavily to the nearly hundred million killed by Communism. 

America is factually exceptional in many ways. Military power, economic power, political sway, all are unrivaled by any other single nation, and you really can't argue that.
I cant hear you over the sounds of your organs being harvested.
Regardless of whether or not you're right, most men who enlist have their hearts in the right place. You commenting this here is as pointless as it is tonedeaf.
>	burning the money you already spent doesn‚Äôt actually hurt Blizzard.


Sharing his message does
I think the intent is to remove your attachment towards the company, its like burning your 5 years worth of collection basically.

Its like people that perma deleted their account, its way harder to come back after you deleted years and years of progress.
AND we're in an age where a box just has a download code, he can get these right back on his PC at no cost anytime.
They fought for an ideal. Dont like an oligarchy. Blame and dispose of them. Soldiers typically join because they want to better the country and its values. The soldiers represent the people in its fierce fighting heart. If you are such a coward to let them stay in power then sit down, at least those men and women fight for an ideal, waiting for the civilian public to put a government in power they can be proud of. Shame on you
You are absolutely right my man.
Just because the US picks conflicts that are beneficial to the US doesn't mean the US can't also prosecute wars which are also beneficial to world freedom and prosperity.  


I think people are often confused by the fact that the US chooses to fight wars which are both profitable to its interests and supportive of freedom.   


Obviously, it would be much more noble to take part in wars which do not benefit it but benefit others, but I think it is still commendable that the US actively chooses to not engage in conflicts which only benefit its interests and do not promote freedom and democracy. If it wanted to, the US could use its military might to secure many more benefits for itself if it wanted, but refrains from doing so for the sake of long term profits and the greater good.
Oh look, it's a naive child throwing rocks.

How was Korea a war for the oligarchs? Do you buy gasoline? Maybe you could donate a bunch of money to Saddam Husseins family with the money you saved on gasoline. Because shit doesn't stay cheap unless someone is making sure it gets here.

Except you're probably 16 years old and have no idea what I'm talking about.
WoW costs monthly.

Also if they CHANGE in capital letters and the people responsible are gone you can still reward them by buying all their stuff again.
Didnt the U.S. call every war they are involved with as "fight for freedom" since 9/11?
Found the communist.
He got Reddit karma out of it, so... win?
And what have you done if i might ask?
It's supposed to be an expression of his opinion about the situation.
Wow is free to play now?
fOuGhT fOr FrEeDoM
You would be better off giving it away to someone that was going to buy a copy to deny a sale
It shows the severing of a relationship
Would've been better if he sold it. That way it lowers the market value and people don't buy it new anymore. 

Burning it doesn't do shit, you're just throwing your own money away, and Blizzard doesn't give 2 shits.
It‚Äôs not about money, it‚Äôs about sending a message.
It's burning a bridge.
Its about sending a message
He's a Marine you can't expect complex thinking
What makes you think Blizzard doesn't want more money from people who love them? It's more expensive to acquire new customers than sell to those that already buy your products.

This man clearly showed the end of his love and money for Blizzard.

Also there's WoW in the pile, which is a monthly subscription and i think Overwatch has lootboxes? No idea if you can buy them by money though. Still one less player in a multiplayer-game dependent on opponents being available.
It's not to show them anything. It's for karma. 

Yes, the actions taken were dumb.
Imaging caring so much you write a whole paragraph about your opinion
Bootlicker
Even if he did, the response to it was banning him and taking his prize money? A little over the top don't you think?

I looked up what the ToS Violation was:
Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard‚Äôs sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player‚Äôs prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard‚Äôs Website Terms. 

So basically Blizzard is stating in plain English: Talking about the human right's violations in Hong Kong is damaging to Blizzard. Way to be Blizzard! /s
Too bad Blizzard's ToS are crap if they go against the idea of free speech. Why don't you reevaluate your principles, ya commie.
But fire is fun!
Some people have principles, others do not...
There really is, some of them are so low effort its almost insulting.
Not bots. Likely real people paid to do what bots do.

They're actually way cheaper than coding functional bots. Coding functional bots costs money to hire people that are more likely going to leave or do something more profitable in another country or a legitimate company.
Blizzard banned and took away prize money of blitzchung a pro hearthstone player for basically saying that he supports hong kong
That's because *our* military's primary purpose is to fight against the enemies of our own people, not against our own people.

I wonder what it's like knowing that your training and skills are more likely to be used against your own countrymen than those from another continent or country. Does it fill one with pride?
It was done at blizzards discretion. They made the choice to act.

If you're lucky enough to live in a democracy respect that people died on their feet so you don't have to live on your knees.
\+ 10 social credits to you!
Attention
It's funny how blizzard is evil enough to destroy products for, but not Apple, Google, or any major tech or entertainment company that provides business to China with censorship
Seems like you would fit in China just right. Maybe move there?
And fake because nothing is even slightly blackened. Such virtue signaling without any balls behind, pathetic.
I guess in a free world.
If you think destroying your game or canceling your sub is pointless...

Try destroying a blizzard game before buying it, or asking blizzard if you can play without paying subscription. 

And they will explain it themselves how big of a deal it realy is.
The one in which I might know my individual actions probably won't change huge company's decisions... but at least I get to follow my own moral code. Supporting companies that are fine with mass genocide and Hitler level cruelty (and in fact indirectly fund this to happen, 5% of Activision Blizzard is effectively Chinese) is a tiiiiiiny bit beyond that.
You mean like in 2010 when they decided WoW forums were going to force users to show real names?

And when people pointed out the obvious stupidity of the policy were told it was a done deal and not changing?

Only for Blizzard to rapidly backtrack over the next few days after tens of thousands of us cancelled WoW subscriptions?

Thanks for your useless hate. Approximately 0 people appreciated it!
Found the propaganda bot!
Unfortunately, a lot of people that enlist, ESPECIALLY boots, and even some that return from deployments, truly believe they're fighting in a war for "freedom". It's crazy how people will call out China for their brainwashing, yet...

> They want to support communism on American soil they can go move there

Catering to a customer is capitalism. This has nothing to do with communism.
Please look into actual communism. Communism is a stateless and moneyless society. If china was Communist, there would be no money to be made there and no reason for blizzard to do business (capital) there. There would also be no authoritarian state. Everything blizzard is doing is on behalf of their profits (capital) and their shareholders interests (capital), aka capitalism.
Plot twist. You only need to redeem the codes. Everything else in the box is useless.
Was looking for this, the boxes don't even look burnt
PSA: please stop doing this. All military personnel who actually did any lick of anything hate being thanked for their "service". People like OP didn't do a damn thing, that's why they still latch onto it years later to try and milk any bit of attention they can out of it. It's disgusting to the rest and the most uncomfortable thing anyone can tell a former military person.
Just the DIs? Nay, ALL OTHER Marines cringe at these posts ..
WoW Vanilla, TBC and Wrath were all great.

There's always one of you ignorant and ungrateful schmucks.
As a professional Photographer...It def is photoshopped, was coming here to see if anyone else also noticed.
Sure does. Nothing even looks like it's even being burned or melted.
Does this count as stolen Valor?
That guys doing it for karma, so I'm methodically downvoting every post he has ever made and would appreciate appreciating
All your presidents are war criminals your country has brought nothing but death, dictatorships and terrorism to other parts of the world
This is just like the hindemburg disaster /s
Wow it‚Äôs really nothing like that tho. What a shit analogy lol
Well, Apple also just pulled an App from the app store that the HK protesters were using, because China asked them to. I wonder how many people burned their iPhones and MacBooks today over it. How many of those same people deleted their iCloud accounts?
My phone company hasn't politically sided with China nor has it done anything to censor me or opposition to China.

There's a difference here, one is "okay if you do business with us you cannot expect us to censor like you do" the other is "since we do business with China we're going to censor stuff they don't like"
We can move some of the files over to a cheap USB stick and burn that?
Also Chair Force. We were trained for this. Throw your PC away.
Burning something you already bought is a pointless display. Cancel any preorders you have, and say hong kong is why. Cancel any subscriptions you have, say hong kong is why. If you're within a refund window of any recent purchases, get a refund, say this is why. On your social media platform of choice, make it clear to Blizzard that you will give them 0 money until they change their stance. I canceled my WoW subscription even though I was thoroughly enjoying classic because this is unacceptable.

I can't see any downside to playing games you already own, though, unless you're buying something or getting non-blizzard ads in it.

China is denying Hong Kong basic human rights, so Hong Kong is protesting, for human rights. Not that hard to understand dickweed. We don‚Äôt know everything right, but we know that human rights are a thing that every human needs
A good reason to support them? Have seen the videos of the HK police beating the crap out of people?
Isn't it weird how free men can immediately tell who you work for?

It puts a strain on their resources as they are obligated to comply.
1. Let you know what kind of data is probably going to end up in Chinese government databases (they're famous for collecting first and sorting later, btw)
2. Annoy Blizzard because they have to deal with it, which isn't going to be cheap.
3. You can also request deletion of your data, reducing the likelihood of 1 and increasing the amount of 2.
Basically a DDoS that costs them additional money in legal fees per reply.
I think in the EU, companies are legally obligated to provide all the data they have on you upon your request. Like, literally everything. Logs, traffic data, purchase history, play time, any personal information they've logged, you name it. 

People are using this as a protest against Blizzard because they MUST comply and because the type of data gathered for each person varies so widely, this type of providing of data cannot be automated efficiently.

Full disclaimer: I'm also American and I read this from another user, so I might not be completely correct. But this is the jist.
They must provide you the personal data in 1 month otherwise you can sue them at the Court of Justice of the European Union and they have to pay some really big fines if the court do their job well (usually over 500k‚Ç¨)
Then youve got the right to request your data. Theres a list of things you have a right to request on the GDPR
Eugdpr.org
As far as I'm aware theres nothing comparable to the GDPR in America.
Edit: if you live in china I would be afraid to try, they might harvest your organs or something communisty like that
Many countries do have privacy laws that include a right to know what data is stored about you, so check your local laws.

New Zealand: [Privacy Principle 6](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0028/latest/DLM297038.html#DLM297038)

> Where an agency holds personal information in such a way that it can readily be retrieved, the individual concerned shall be entitled [...] to have access to that information.

But observe the limitations and the possibility to charge you a "reasonable" fee.
Just ask for it without saying where you live.
If you don't specify they at least have to verify where you live in order to proceed. many companies that are part of the EU just do it anyway since the employee behind the job just sees it as busy work (if the company doesnt have a policy not to do it). though if they're busy they probably won't (aka like right now)
It would seem someone found a way, since they do business in California, theyre required to for anyone that requests it really
You heard him privats.

This has become major news with politicians weighing in. You're either not watching the situation or, are yourself, delusional.
wow and wow classic are a part of blizzard. no mercy, no prisoners.
Me
Oh I know. This is differently not the first American company to bend to the CCP's will. As a 3rd gen Chinese-American. I boycott all American companies that does shady business with the CCP trashes over there. I'm proud to be American and proud to be Chinese (by heritage). The CCP does not represent me, as they are the reason my family left that trash hole. The US and the US Constitution represents me and it pisses me to no bounds that an American company would do business with those fucks.
I didn't say HK people were Americans. I was thanking him for fighting for Americans of all races and creed.
Unexpected reddit "blowback" discussion warms my heart.
Men?!? They‚Äôre kids
That's why I said the imagery is still strong, even if financially it doesn't do anything for the boycott.
> If it wanted to, the US could use its military might to secure many more benefits for itself if it wanted, but refrains from doing so 

"They could be shittier, so let's not call them shitty!" What's your address? I want to come take some of your stuff. I won't burn your house down or anything, so you really can't complain.

No US conflict in your lifetime has been for others' benefits.
> Because shit doesn't stay cheap unless someone is making sure it gets here.

So, you're agreeing with him i guess?
Oh look, it's a bootlicking moron. Do you think the Korean war wasn't wildly profitable and secured long term contracts? What did Korea have to do with American freedom? Iraq had nothing to do with cheap oil for anyone except the oil industry, all your stupid ass has to do is look at the retail price history of gas. Further, you're not entitled to gas or cheap products ESPECIALLY at the cost of peoples lives. 

But most 16 year olds like yourself haven't cracked open a history book or anything of the like. Go read "War Is A Racket" and take your first steps into manhood.
LOL so Blizz would have made even more money then. I mean yeah totally boycottblizz right now, but see the bigger picture. Don‚Äôt create potentially more costs for you. 

Also i know that wow costs monthly. cancel your sub if you want to. But that overwatch tho. Just saying :)
You mean every war they caused?
Donated to the Gofundme campaign that was active about 1-2 months back. Your turn.

I rather spend an extra minute to give another reader more context than simply spit out who cares. But hey, awesome job replying on my comment. Keep it up.
Ahhh okay, at first I was unsure if that was for this or was something else alright thanks for the reply
Im not from the states but the reason i can be independent is because of my grandpa and many others that fell fighting for our country. I have more respect for him than anyone else i know.
What does that even mean
This is only meaningful if you accept that individual agency, responsibility, and action have meaning.  

For those that argue otherwise, it's very telling of how they think.
It's photoshopped in, badly.
Lmao some of you people are so delusional
Now, now. They're a propaganda *person.*

Just because they don't respect the humanity of other individuals doesn't mean we don't.
Oppression is only okay when America does it, duh. All this outrage about Chinese concentration camps, and yet try mentioning the literal concentration camps America is currently running almost anywhere on this site and you'll get shit on.

Not defending China by any means, but the complete lack of self-awareness is pretty glaring.
It's near impossible to escape Chinese investments and companies. But I think it's not difficult to avoid companies that are acting the way Blizzard does.
Lmao. Ok. America is American first, capitalist second. Test us. Blizzard sure is.
yeah, of course, im ungrateful to assholes that kill people and destroy countries for "freedom"

if you are a murderer you are a murderer, dont try to call yourself "hero"

You can see the Overwatch box darkening and the red toy melting.

Wow, what a shit reply. But who am I kidding from a bunch of outrage sheep.....
None. Because it‚Äôs not the ‚ÄúIt‚Äù thing to do while the Blizz hate train is rolling.
Do you use an iPhone?
All I‚Äôm saying is that everyone is being hypocritical about this because the Chinese Company Tencent has say into almost every other game company, movies, and almost every other avenue of entertainment in China. They own like 5% of Activision Blizz stocks, 100% Riot Games (League of Legends) 40% Epic games,  11.5% Bluehole (PugG), Ubisoft 5%. Tencent produced movies like Mr. Rogers with Tom Hanks. They HEAVILY censor all of these things to fit their agenda. No one bats an eye, and some kid is under contractual obligation does something against said contract and gets dealt a punishment and everyone loses their minds. The kid is a hero, he knew exactly what he was doing. But don‚Äôt blame Blizzard for upholding their contract and businesses model. Hell Apple censored the Taiwanese flag for a while cause it pleased China.

can confirm. best way to max out this year's budget is to just throw away pcs and furniture.
Monthly active users is one of the most important metrics for investors. So if you want the greatest amount of impact, you really should stop playing their games altogether.
WoW subscription costs.
By not playing the games anymore you decrease the active player count which looks bad in the earnings call for the company. You also help contribute to scaring off the whales if they don't have anyone left to play with.
Pointless? Far from it. Especially if you turn it into a symbol. 
And if you are boycotting the company but still using the product s your just a hypocrite whose opinion has no value.
It's not pointless. It's the same reason we have funerals - the person is dead, what's the point? They're not going to appreciate it...? The point is to help people around them have some closure. 

People have been playing Blizzard games for decades. By deleting our accounts, by burning their games, it helps us move on. 

Human beings are not stone cold machines. We need crap like this sometimes.
It's not pointless. Imagine if a Blizzard executive comes on this sub and sees the top post being a guy burning their games, it sends a message.
I think it serve as a way to remove your attachment to Blizzard, people collect these boxes and toys from their favorite company over the years, its way way harder to comeback once they've burned these collection.
This!

Just refunded my copy of WC3 reforged, wc3 is literally my favorite game of all time, however I can't support a company which dumps democracy for the chance of some money, it's disgusting.
I mean, even if he burns WOW he still needs to cancel his subscription...
Destroying it can draw attention to a cause. But not playing it can also be helpful.

When someone uses something, enjoys it and talks about it, that's the best advertising (word-of-mouth).  Continuing to play can draw other people they interact with to buy/use/play it, which is what they're trying to avoid.  Cutting it out stops spread.
Ya if you have overwatch already just play that since no monthly sub, and also play only mei
considering physical copies give you a digital version in the end it doesn‚Äôt matter (except i guess for consul players). This is symbolic and just as powerful visual as canceling is from a monetary stand point.
Propaganda is important to ANY cause, be it wicked or benign. I‚Äôd say burning your shit is some good propaganda
I could see your argument if we're talking about people burning Nike shoes and stuff, but since the Blizzard launcher is a thing, this is nostly a symbollic gesture. He still has access everything contained on the discs.

That said, Blizzarf relies on people playing their games. Loot boxes in Overwatch, Subscriptions for WOW, microtransactions for WOW, the list goes on. By not playing WoW or other Blizz games, you hurt their overall subscriber numbers, their revenue from all those nickle and dime sources. Not playing the games you own is the strongest way to send Blizzard a message.
Play on their servers without buying lootboxes or their subscription.
He obviously burned them for the internet points.  


Internet points are the main reason people are outraged, I doubt many of the people actually care and will be over it once a game comes up at Blizzcon they like the look of.
USA only use drones on hospitals now
That helps them too and hurts the store selling it.

Often times stores only order more from the distributor based on current inventory and not sales (to help keep stock up accounting for shrinkage). By stealing and burning you're triggering the store to order more copies.
Just curious. "U.S. Army" wasn't too specific.
Yes, the altruistic army man should not be challenged, lest we seem like traitors.
Depends on what war is being supported. Most Western wars are pointless campaigns in babykilling for profit.

Actually its about why Blizzard banned and took the prize money away. Nothing to do with the guy. Everything to do with Blizzards hands in Chinese pockets. Because of that China has infuence over them. and because Blizzard lost their way, they decided to side with greed over Democracy and freedom of speech.
It's really not. Please stop spreading false information on this thread.
Just because you have given up doesn't mean everyone else should follow your advice.

I just had to do that Cyber training shit again. I hate it.
This.  Blizzard has set up MAUs as one of their primary success metrics for quarterly earnings calls.  If you want their investors to throw a shit-fit, log out of BNET, don't sign back into BNET, and wait for 3 weeks (which is when their next earnings call and BlizzCon happens).
As we all know they Trick around with Sold Accounts, not really active users. Cuz the number sounds better.
Just go to roblox and play a duplicate of the game you stopped playing
I hadn't thought of that. I thought that just cancelling my recurring 6 month subscription, telling why in the cancelling form and stop playing when it runs out (in 5 and a half month) was as much as I could do. I'll empty my mail boxes (I use them to store stuff I haven't got room for in my bags) and try to stop playing. I'm not sure I'm able to stop playing WoW unless I find some other game to scratch the itch. 

As a parting gift to blizzard I made a character called Freehongkong. Maybe I'm childish, but I thought it was funny.
If you think 1000 odd people will make a difference to their earning call your delusional lol
Companies don't care about symbols or hypocrisy. All they care about is the bottom line. What effects that is not buying from them. They don't care if you burn shit you already bought (especially since every blizzard game has a digital release now so burning physical media does literally nothing).
Like you who is probably using an iPhone to type this even though Apple is doing the exact same thing.
You're
If it helps you to do it, great, do it. My point was just that Activision doesn't care if a few hundred people burn some blizzard games. Just like Nike didn't care that people were burning their shoes or the NFL didn't care that people were burning their jerseys.
It sends a message that the person is mentally ill and they'll probably laugh about it.  


People will move on in a few weeks, this is a country that the majority of outraged people don't live in or have any dealings with. If you think a genuinely large number of people are going to avoid games they want to play based on that you're delusional.

In other cases, similar destruction  (burning Nikes, smashing Keurigs, etc) actually backfired on the movement, making things worse. That's probably why people think it's a bad idea. But in this case, there's not really an "opposition" (nobody in the US is passionately in favor of the Chinese regime the way they're passionately in favor of Colin Kapernik) to accidentally mobilize into buying more shoes, so you're right that it can't hurt.
This could've been an intelligent debate, except that everyone started insulting each other.
Why does it matter how much the donation was? Even if it's 50 cents he at least donated, the real problem is that you're trying to undermine the action.
You could have sold it. That way you at least get some money back and you prevent that person from buying new copies "which supports blizzard" lol
.....all those boxes are just that, boxes, the games are tied to an account which given how fucking stupid he is claiming he fought for "our freedom", probably is playing WoW right now and just wants attention.
Having now have read up on it. It seems people are more mad that they guy was banned because of speaking his own political opinion, the money is just the icing
He posted an "update" photo in another post that was so horribly shopped he deleted the comment and the imgur post.

You should post this in more threads, this is good info. I am not even playing Blizzard games now but will do it.
Try Pok√©mon Go, it is nice to get outside a bit. Maybe get sunglasses for the mole eyes, though.
Yo try ESO my man, the gameplay isn't exactly the same but it'll be easy to find a guild and is a pretty in depth realization of Elder Scrolls lore.
Well, then join them so the number gets bigger.
> If you think 1000 odd people will make a difference to their earning call your delusional lol

When it comes to WoW, they have had falling population numbers since 2010. This might accelerate the reduction. I've already had a lot of trouble finding players to cooperate with at non-peak hours, and increasing the population decline will only make this worse. At a certain point the whole thing collapses like a house of cards.
1000 odd people in the span of a few days will definitely make investors pay attention. Not enough to cause Blizzard much financial loss, but probably enough for the investors to tell Blizzard to knock it off with any future political statements.
It's not for companies it's for the people. And it won't be for most people just 1 or 2 out of a hundred that will be inspired by it.

Look it's a sales game to win hearts and minds. This helps. Will it make a big difference? Likely not but maybe you never no, but again likely not. But it will make a difference. That combined with the thousands of other geatures like it will have a combined effect.
Actually concurrent player count matters to their investors. Burning the shit is the same effect as not playing, which does impact them.
Do you like arguing with yourself? You literally just made something up about me to make me look like a hypocrite when you have literally zero information about me? How stupid are you?


And no I'm not using an Apple I haven't used one since the i4. For various other reasons.
Speak more carefully. Consider that the US has destroyed entire nations with which our people had no quarrel with or outrage against, simply to protect some small interest in the region and crush some bit of tyranny we took issue with.

A few outraged people is always where the big things start. Whether its a woman sitting on a bus, or a kid drawing graffiti on a wall in Syria.
Your defensiveness makes me wonder if you were in Iraq.
I think you're being paranoid.
Good point. I like war and all soldiers now.
Yeah, bro, hate to tell ya, idc what you *think* a word means. There are dictionaries, use one and look up what the word liberal means.

Nothing better than a legal DDoS simply because so many people are upset that it overloads the servers anyways.
Sounds about right to me. Fuckin get'em
Cool. 

Uh...what footsteps?
My point is, those games he burned because of his ideology are probably worth a lot more than your '50 cents' for the charity. Granted, this isnt gonna help the cause directly, but he took a stand and burned his games. Thats worth something too

I read yours.  You're an ignorant schmuck.
Wait, did you just use additional evidence that this is real as your argument supporting why its fake?
You gotta start somewhere with people, it's better to laser focus on a few things especially at first, we're told when door knocking for politicians to focus on what each individual cares about most, in this case people don't care about a lackluster Mr Rogers movie, in this particular case with this particular group of people it's Blizzard-Activision games.

Appealing to those who *do* care about that movie is important too but that's not something you'd do right here and now.
I accident put "chase him down" and my NCO shady eyed me. We both know Chair Force like myself cant outrun anyone.
Why should I? I am not negatively impacted by then and I have enjoyed many hours in their games previously and have made many good/close friends because of their games and that is something priceless to me. Also, I don't have an active subscription for WoW and all the other games are already bought. Deleting my account would be nothing but stupid of me throwing that money away and all that hard work/hours I put in to leveling, grinding and more.
Won't make a difference, mark my words.
Yeah and what will that do? Does Blizzard have more power than the United Nations or the countless others countries who have tried to oppose China? It‚Äôs a Chinese political problem that is far to complicated and goes much deeper than anyone on reddit is capable of understanding. 

Going against Blizzard has little to no impact towards the situation then again each to their on, if you choose to go against Blizzard, sure go ahead.
Careful with that. Cause if you just make it a "sales game" for hearts and minds you risk compromising the impact of the message to garner more "hearts and minds". Let the argument stand on its own merit and if it is sound it will stand. As soon as you make special efforts to "capture hearts and minds" with the attitude of "it's a sales game" then the result is less important. Gathering more to the cause becomes a goal more important than the cause. And then you've lost sight of the cause.

Misread it, my bad.
Canceling those I understand. I'm speaking about physical merchandise. If I had overwatch on console, physical, id sell it. Not burn it.
Does this honestly look real though? Despite it being engulfed in flames nothing looks nearly as charred as it should be.
I respect your decision to protest, I will die for your right to do so (prior USAF SFS myself)  but I will also disagree in the way you do it. But fight your fight and keep the faith.
You had me in the second half, you turned everyone off in the first. That's a very childish/immature stance. "Well that doesn't affect ME". You'd think very differently if it did, and want all the support you could get. Other's lives are at stake, and you're taking the "not my problem" route
I don't think one single person thinks that Blizzard has any power over what is happening in Hong Kong. What people are trying to do is express their dissatisfaction with Blizzard for actively punishing someone for voicing their opinion on what is happening in Hong Kong.
Propaganda is important to ANY cause, be it wicked or benign. I‚Äôd say but in your shit is some good propaganda
Check his comment history. He‚Äôs pro China.
[removed]
[removed]
Ahh you're right. Oh well, still worth asking for.
Then you‚Äôre just transferring those subscription fees to the person who buys the discs, Blizzard loses nothing.
Yes, it does. The packaging for those games have clear-coats on them to make them more robust. It looks like the fire is just getting started. Look at the bubbling and cracking on the overwatch box. At that angle, you'd need a lot of practice and time to make the textures look high res and blended in like that. The flames are also very very difficult to fake over existing objects without giving it away that it's fake. I don't see why someone would spend hours and resources to fake this post. Do people spend more time faking stuff? Sure, but this would be pro level stuff for what return?
Of course I would act differently if it affected me but I am also smart enough to know that, lashing out at Blizzard for siding with China for a political problem (that is WAY deeper and more complex than any one on reddit understands) won‚Äôt make any difference to the situation. 

UN and many other countries have tried to contain China plenty of times and it hasn‚Äôt worked. You think some odd 1000 gamers boycotting an American companies games will? No, sadly that‚Äôs not how the world works.

It has loot boxes. Not dlc. You still stop permanently playing it by selling it instead of wasting your money. It's like you guys purposely don't want to understand.
[removed]
Oh it has lootboxes? That's literally worse. Also, if I'm stopping playing something on principal, why would I want to make it easier for someone else to play it by selling it to them? It's like you purposely don't want to understand.
[removed]
How is it easier? Because they aren't spending as much money as they would for a new copy? That may be so but you're still getting money back. They are literally supporting blizzard by buying a new copy, which is something you don't want them to do.
[removed]
I could engage your pedantism here and argue that someone looking to buy a copy off you isn't looking for a new copy in the first place, but this entire line of debate misses the point by miles, so let me put this in a different way:

Do you seriously not get the difference between no longer wishing to support a company or product and being outright disgusted with them? Does that sort of emotion not register with you? That's not a rhetorical question, I am legitimately curious. Burning the item means that they are divesting and disavowing a product in a way that is personal and has been historically symbolic. Let's say for instance, that I am a reformed former White Supremacist. In this instance, I am not selling my copy of the Turner Diaries to someone else, I am throwing it in the trash or burning it.
One less copy in the world. You must be young to not understand that clear symbolism and if you're pinching the couple bucks ya may get from resale.
would you burn/destroy your tv if the owner of the brand said they hated black people? yes or no
Would you stop beating your wife if I destroyed my imaginary television? Yes or no.
typical infant response
Your question makes just as much sense.

EDIT: You also completely sidestepped the question I had asked you in the post prior to that.
My question makes sense, youre just scared to answer it. How bout this. If you had a samsung tv and this situation was about the company samsung instead of blizzard, what would you do? You wont answer that question cause you're scared or being hypocritical.
Let me repeat my earlier question, because it seems conversation stopped after that: "Do you seriously not get the difference between no longer wishing to  support a company or product and being outright disgusted with them?  Does that sort of emotion not register with you?"

And to answer your question, if I had a television and found the manufacturer to be utterly reprehensible, then yes, I would dispose of it in compliance with California state law on the disposal of electronic devices (they take that sort of thing pretty seriously here) and replace it, because I know eventually it would eat at me even if I didn't think about it every single minute the way I might while playing Starcraft 2. This is a bit of a false equivalency since you don't need to replace a Blizzard game unless you have literally no other games, but yes, I would, just as I have lost money divesting petroleum stock.

EDIT: To be fair, I would also give said manufacturer a little bit of time to make things right, just as I probably would for Blizzard I were a WoW-head. But I completely understand where the Marine is coming from. And Blizzard seems to have tripled down for now.
Thats a rhetorical question. Just because you said it isn't doesn't change that. But ill repeat what I said to I guess answer that. If im disgusted with a company and dont want to support them, I will sell whatever I have of theirs. Not destroy it because that is my property and im preventing them from getting another sale.

and I dont believe you would destroy your tv. you would sell it
No, I was asking quite literally. I have to take your answer as meaning that that sort of thing does NOT register with you, thus the disconnect.

More than that, you can believe about me what you want. You asked, I answered honestly. Do you really think I would bother trying to get $40 for a used television through Craigslist if I felt nauseous about the device?

I have been a Blizzard fan all the way back to StarCraft 1 when I was very young.

Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. A wholly owned subsidery of the Chinese Communist Peoples Party of Liberal Fascism and Idiocy ...

If the NFL can do it, why shouldn't Blizzard?
Oh man this made me laugh. I wish I could attend blizzcon this year just to run into some of you lovely folks, I wonder how much of a shit show it's going to be.
Lol they locked the Wikipedia page to prevent someone from vandalizing the page
Nothing new. American freedom of anything goes only as far as it is not interfering with "getting money". Look at NBA and  Daryl Morey. There is no freedom of speech or right to support  something like defense of human rights because there is a lot of money.  So much work was done to fix his tweet and lick all those China asses to show them who is the b\*tch.
They're in Irvine? Thats a couple miles from me. Hmmmm
Hong kong is british. Rule Britannia Britannia rule the waves!
PS. I don't care about Hong Kong
Pretty much every "American" company has no nation, when Pride month started, it was everywhere, company promoting pride month in the west, while in the East it gets barely acknowledged likr it doesn't exist "pride month who dat?"

Oh fucking commie. I hope online will drops down and blizz will understand what they do lol
They have been stripped of ALL American spirit.

For me, their reputation has been shattered. The damage they have done to their brand is immense. Once brand loyalty and trust has been lost, it‚Äôs just a matter of time before revenue takes a hit.

Actually no. Its common knowledge that here in America even the president have to listen to whoever donated them the most money during their campaign. Its the american culture.

Look it up on German google... it says Chinese
They have betrayed the very core values their country (ideally) holds dear in favor of catering to a totalitarian government.  That makes them essentially traitors in my book.
That became pretty clear back in MOP though when they had to actually announce it wasn't a joke.
That's right. America follows hardcore capitalism and that is what they're doing.
Oh you guys acted like this has not been done before. Let me tell you that despite all the outrage you guys creating. It is stated in the TOS that no political affiliation should be made by the player or even the caster. Let this be a lesson to all of you who forget that in nineteen eighty-four, when much of the world has fallen victim to perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance, historical negationism, and propaganda. Great Britain, known as Airstrip One, has become a province of a superstate named Oceania that is ruled by the Party who employ the Thought Police to persecute individuality and independent thinking. Big Brother, the leader of the Party, enjoys an intense cult of personality despite the fact that he may not even exist. The protagonist, Winston Smith, is a diligent and skillful rank-and-file worker and Party member who secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion.
Errrr nah this is definitely a function of a Capitalist society? Or at least Corporations under Capitalism. The only people who matter to the top end of a business are the Shareholders. This level of evil amorality is the Norm not the Exception.
 
Here's a hint, any business unwilling to pay its dues in taxes will do evil things. Find me a major business not participating in a Tax Haven.
 
You want these people to actually work towards anyone's benefit? The entire system has to change. Will you still champion the boycott when the grievances stop being with China, whose evil's have been put under scrutiny your entire life because they are evil but you knowing that is also beneficial for propaganda? Will you support the boycott when they exploit workers in developing nations? Will you support the boycott when they buy political influence? When they hire people, force them to work hundreds of unpaid hours, then fire them? When they release "charity items" that trick their customers into paying for their massive tax breaks?
 
There is no ethical consumption under metastatic capitalism.
If you want to help boycott blizzard join r/FuckBlizzard if not thats fine
Is the Wikipedia page edited/defaced yet? :)
It *is* an American subsidiary / holding company though. That US companies whose ownership is organized via stock market shares have profit increase as an intrinsic value and that there are no regulations to prevent creeping self-censorship for appeasing foreign governments doesn‚Äôt negate that fact, only serves as a point of criticism towards US politico-economic system in general.
They want to be a Chinese company? I'm cool with that. Hearthstone is off my phone. And my entire battle.net is off my PC. cyah have fun in China.
Fuck Blizzard. Fuck China. And fuck all the American companies/organizations bending over to get screwed up the ass at China‚Äôs will. 

They aren‚Äôt American and should be ashamed of themselves.
Sorry but I'm not going to let a situation that has nothing to do with me ruin my enjoyment of a game I waited for years to be rereleased. Blizzard taking money from some irrelevant rich gamer for a reason that was probably in his contract (no political talk anywhere) is irrelevant to me, and I'm sure as hell not going to let the internet tell me I'm a piece of shit for playing a game I love because Blizzard is "big evil corporation". Just shut up already.
A lot of left wingers are trying to twist this around to talk bad about "America."

I'm not surprised.

I mean I dont care about their stance on anything. They werent wrong in enforcing their TOS in this situation. But punishing people who had nothing to do with his actions, thats where we should really be worried because thats 100% making an example out of people just to appease the chinese.

Not only this but I've uninstalled anything that's blizzard owned or ran, including overwatch, hearthstone, diablo, and destiny 2.

Edit: fixed typos, and clarified my statement.

They did that for the money too, don't think it was for another reason.

Oh they have morals. Like their moral duty to their shareholders. Are top shareholders public record? I'd like to contact them about their blood money.
Repost of a comment I made in a different thread :

This is a huge non-argument. You can't just search out a specific subreddit where people talk about news around this specific company and then drop something that completely shifts the discussion. You are deliberately shifting the discussion from "customers and others are voicing their anger at actions from a company" to "companies in a capitalist system are inherently immoral". 

That's not the point here, because the way you post it and the timing of it only helps to keep that status quo. Instead of making people doubt capitalism, you only normalise it and help the criticism towards individual companies pass over more easily. You are the grease that makes sure criticism towards individual companies will not stick. 

This might seem like an ad homimem and it is. I won't call you schoolyard insults but I do feel like I need to call this out, I feel like you are approaching this either in the wrong way or downright disingenuous. There is nothing wrong with campaigning against a single company or getting upset at a single immoral act more companies do because it still shows cracks. If the genuine results are not in the changes made by a company, they are in finding more allies. 

People are better at seeing individual processes they disagree with than the entire economic system they are comfortable with out of familiarity. The best way to get people motivated is still a single cause, but for those motivated it leaves a lasting impact.
No it isn't. And it never support commie. Its first time when.
You're digging yourself a hole you won't be getting out of for a *long* time, friend.

\> uses 20 year old kids with xbox controllers to murder civilians while breeding more terrorists 

....you think drones are piloted by 20 year olds with xbox controllers and they just blow up random civilians?
I feel like I always hear this nihilistic attitude when it comes to any criticism regarding places like China. People can criticize the American government and criticize other governments and we don't need this bad faith whataboutism. 

There is also a difference between the usage of drones and the freedom to criticize things like the usage of drones. Freedom is the first step.
But! but! America!..

You can't be this ill-informed.....
The article was locked in April, because idiots defaced the article "for the lulz".

Lock has nothing to do with current situation, to it is lucky it is there, to keep people from defacing it again.
It wouldnt be hard to jaws of life off the orc's head
Dont worry, overwatch's new char "perfect social creddit marysue" will help
I mean, it's not like this represents a major change. This just brought to light what a cancerous blight they've become in such a way that only the most devoted fanboys could deny it.
In april.
Indeed.  Luckily since "corporations are people" we should theoretically be able to hold them to that descriptor.

&#x200B;

Fair is fair no?
What does this even mean? That's like saying America follows murders because they support freedom. Capitalism is just the free market. People reacting and choosing not to purchase a product because of their beliefs is also the free market at play.
Actually, I think America is way more pro freedom than pro capitalism. And I also think you wanted to say 'greed' instead of 'capitalism', because capitalism is not inherently bad, greed is.

But anyway, Blizzard is now just a shadow of it's former self
You notice that the extent of their punishment is a political statement and therefore political affiliation in itself? it seems like most of us would of been with a fine or some kind of probation. Also what are you even trying to say about 1984?
> Brings \[them\] into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages \[Blizzard‚Äôs\] image.‚Äù 

Nothing about this rule mentions anything political. It is intentionally vague, so that Blizzard can use it to it's discretion. If you can't see that and you believe nobody can do anything about this, you're part of the problem.
When exactly most harshest punishement (harshest than even for cheating) was applied for mere statement at the end of game interview? As far as I know, the closer you get to China, the stricter these rules are regulated.
\*no ethical consumption under crony capitalism.

&#x200B;

As a independent voter, to even understand what the fuck of a twisted capitalism we have in America, you really have to understand the history of how it evolved... from 1700 onwards. Literally.
Taxation is theft. There is nothing ethical about it.
Totally agree with you
Thats cool and all but the quality of games is going to degrade anyway just like the movie industry in china now that the ccp are dictating what they can film. I get that you want all of this to not effect you but it still does. The CCP wresting control of western corporations is going to eventually impact your life negatively and by then it may be too late to speak out.

 I get that you aggressively dont care and i almost like that because it is its own punishment lol, but whatever. The truth is what it is.
"I care more about having a few hours of fun than I care about the fact that I'm giving money to fascists."
Ok boomer
I just use their services and consume their bandwidth, server time, etc, without spending a penny on their game. I have Overwatch/Hearthstone, but I won't buy loot boxes or card backs until they reverse this decision and commit to free speech

Remember, if you continue to use anything made in China (Clothes, Electronics), you are actively supporting authoritarianism and human rights abuses by proxy.
Dudes seriously shit-talking me for canceling my sub in a group I'm at for wow classic lol, even after explaining the whole thing, I swear human rights are just "meh" to some people.

Don't forget cable companies.
Are you seriously trying to defend murder of civilians
I don't care. Because all anyone is going to do is complain online an nothing will change 


How about maybe instead of complaining about a gaming company you start your own mass protests to force your fuckin government to stop.doing all business with China.
I don't see a mass of people sitting in front of the White House threatening to storm it if they don't stop the war. No one will to take drastic measures like we have done for all of human history.

So I'm enjoy classic and not care
Oh had they? Didn't bother to check the lock date.
Correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't that some person decision? Real life people are in charge of every corporation.
I think you're confusing capitalism with markets. Capitalism is a system wherein economic power lies with owners. While it's not inherently greedy, it provides huge incentives for people to become wealthier at the expense of all other values.
Good luck being successful in a capitalistic society without being greedy.
Yeah, we just need to eliminate greed and capitalism will work perfectly. Simple.
He's making a reference to the famous book by George Orwell.  Not a good one, but a reference non the less
I mean 'Crony Capitalism' is just Capitalism. I call it Metastatic because it has not only become cancerous but spread to parts of our lives where it has absolutely no place.
If you hate roads, public services then sure. Otherwise it isn‚Äôt theft.
Look up whale and fish model. You are still providing added value to Blizz by playing in queues.

 I recommend r/MagicArena as a substitute to hearthstone, or r/EternalCardGame if you need mobile. TF2 is a great substitute to Overwatch. You have F2P options that will actually make a difference.
You are actually just joining the 80% who never purchase anyway but still provide a lot of value to the company. They provide enemies and partners (aka "fun") for the matchmaker of the paying users. They provide stable user numbers that help the paying users to make a decision if it is still worth to spend on the game.

If you want to hurt Blizzard you have to stop using their services for good. Even though it hurts yourself too. Noone said morals and ethics are free or easy.
I was aware they didn't own them outright but still had a deal with them through parent company Activision, which is why Destiny was launched under the battle.net launcher.  I had not realized that Microsoft had bought them at the beginning of the year. I appreciate you making me fact check myself.  Activision Blizzard is still a Chinese funded and destiny 2 is still a game made by Bungie and Activision, and one that made most of it's PC sales money on the Activision Blizzard market for them which doesn't make me feel any better about having them on my systems.
shhh. its a bad game anyway...
People do not care until the shit hits them, especially gamers. But I don't blame them, their life is about gaming and feeling good in games.
Of all the subs I'm watching regarding this subject, WoW is the only one with more support toward Blizzard, than banned player. State of mind, I suppose.

that's what happens when you're 14 and think you are very smart.
It's "meh" to some people because normal people can see the Hong Kong thing for what it is: State Department and CIA stooges meddling in foreign affairs to start another war.

I wish every one of these "people" supporting revolution in Hong Kong were drafted to be frontline infantry in the coming war with China. Put your money where your mouth is and die for what you are virtue signalling for.

the corporations are people statute was originally ruled on in a case against the Southern Pacific Railroad in the 1800s. 

It's been upheld long enough that we should be able to hold corporations to that descriptor, even if that original ruling was in error by a paid judge.
Well, the thing that capitalism inherently makes people lose their other values is not true. If it was like this, everyone would start losing their values and that isn't happening. I know people that are successful in this system and are still great people. 

Capitalism by itself isn't bad, this is what made possible great things and great companies, and for some time, these great games.blizzard made. Greed, on the other hand, is what brings down all of this down. Blizzard was successful and maintained their values in capitalism, and everything was fine, until Activision came, and greed started making its way to the other half of the company, and (the term "half" is just because they're two, I don't know exactly the % of how much is blizzard or Activision....) Today I feel they're just one and the same.

 Greed is the current villain, let's not blame the wrong thing, or we will not know how to repair it correctly. I hope that they would.get away from Activision, to come back to their glory times, even if they didn't have the budget for the best visually game ever, if they managed to come back with their core.vslues, I will support them.like I never did. It is possible, but today, highly unlikely.
I am and I'm not being greedy. It all depends what you perceive as "success".
I know people who are successful without being greedy. They worked hard, studied a freaking lot, and now they work with jobs that paids them very well. That's not being greedy, that's ones will power to be successful in life. What's greedy in studying a lot? xD
Still better than The communist regime of China.
I didn't said it was simple, or even possible. But even communism with greed still creates bad things xD this is no exception. If only it was so easy.... But this is reality so of course it isn't.

I just hope blizzard would come back from this path.
Not really. All capitalism is in a pure form is someone makes something, and I choose whether I want to buy it or not. I'm not forced to buy it. Someone doing something unethical, or I otherwise disagree with? I can choose to not buy their product.
You think the only way to provide those things is via government? And that justifies everything else they do?

You're insane. That BS you mentioned is the tiniest fraction of the state budget. And they suck at it. 

Dominoes handles roads better than them.
Turns out there are tons of privately maintained roads. 
And everyone's favorite "socialism" (it's not socialism) in Sweden 66% of their roads privatized. Bootlickers BTFO FOR MUH ROADS!
Roads are paid for by gas tax (small cents price on every gallon you buy) not by income tax.

We could all stop paying income tax and roads would still be paid for. (Not that I support 0 taxes, but you see my point)
I do play Shadowverse as an alternative to Hearthstone and Paladins as an alternative to Overwatch.

I don't think me playing OWatch/Hearthstone adds any value to their game via "whale and fish model". Not like me playing makes any noticeable difference on queue times or anything like that.
Then I will join the 80%. I spend a lot of money on blizzard games, usually end up dropping 5-10 dollars every day. I play Overwatch and HOtS for a school team and if I stop practicing I'll get kicked off. I'm not willing to sacrifice that for the sake of the boycott but I will stop giving blizzard my money. Just because I'm playing their games for my own personal interests doesn't mean I support what blizzard does and I believe all of their social media platforms being overrun with hate will force a response out of them in time regardless. I have nothing against people boycotting their games, I just wanted to say that I'm in a position where doing so would have a horrible negative impact on my life and I shouldn't be judged as a suppressor of free speech just for doing so.
Destiny was only financed by Activision when they owned Bungie. Bungie is now publishing it as an independent developer on Steam and have severed all ties with Activision-Blizzard
> destiny 2 is still a game made by Bungie and Activision

Incorrect. blizactivision has nothing to do with them anymore.
No it isn‚Äôt. The game is free to play, very well made, and the DLCs are very fun. Destiny 2 is free on Steam with the first two DLCs, you should play it.
>WoW is the only one with more support toward Blizzard

Ironically WoW is the game that should have the least support by now after multiple expansions of pure failure.

But WoW also has the biggest Blizzard ball-lickers, so it's to be expected.
WoW players have spent exponentially more money on Blizzard than any other players, except the Whaliest of Hearthstone players. It's unfortunate but understandable that they're more conflicted about throwing it all away.
Its because they did a really good job with the classic rollout. As I‚Äôve said before I was really enjoying it and wanted to play but now it‚Äôs not even installed.
You got me \*raises hands\*
Okay, undo whatever laws that prevent me from being eligible for the selective service and thus keep me uneligible from serving just because I take methylphenidate for my ADHD.
Flatearther?
So China is willing to let HK go peacefully? It is the CIA and State Dept making up the whole thing?
I wouldn't mind killing some communists and freeing the east hemisphere from China's genocidal government. Pity it'll never happen because of Nuclear deterrence
That is a very dumb argument.  We don't tell all the racists in our country to go fight our wars in the Middle East even though many support that because they hate people who aren't white. The people who join the military know that war is a possibility, I served 4 years myself. During that time I've met plenty of people who were in the service who didn't agree with what we were doing, but did it anyways because it was our job, duty, and we took an oath to do it. I think fighting for HK human rights, and combatting genocide is a much more noble use of life than going to kill random people in the Middle East for oil and money.
>Put your money where your mouth is and die

If you looked at what's happening in China, you'd know this already happens.
chinese smurf detected!!!
Capital is success in capitalism.
China calls itself "communist" but in reality its economic system is a form of state capitalism. Communism would require the abolition of the state and the handing of economic power to collectives.
How can an economic system be better than a country? That‚Äôs comparing apples to oranges.
The problem isn't that we don't have enough government interference, it's that we have too much government interference.  
Let people boycott if they'd like. That's their choice under capitalism.
Yes but the basic setup of the system all but guarantees cronyism. It is only sensible for a Capitalist to maximize profits and minimize spending without an external force acting upon it. This means that they can spend their money to conceal the amoral things they do. Or to lobby politicians to avoid passing holidays or regulations that might hinder their ability to profit.
 
Capitalism left to its own devices, even if you had all the kindest CEOs working at this moment, will **always** become Crony Capitalism. Restricted and/or Well Regulated Capitalism can be a perfectly fine system but it is far from it's natural state.
Oh, I‚Äôd like a list of these privately maintained roads because odds are those are in places with HOAs which collect fees. 

And don‚Äôt call a driveway a ‚Äúprivate road‚Äù either. 

Fact is taxes allows everyone to share the financial burden to have things. In the US we have the Small Business Association which is paid for by taxes. They help individuals prepare to start a business.
Can you imagine being enough of a Corporate Cuckold to actually want to be a Libertatian? "Taxes are theft! They take 10% of my take home. And then they use it on things that almost always benefit me! My private employer is great though!! He only takes 90% of the Value I create. He uses that to make sure I don't have to get sick days or reasonable vacation time."
the comments above didn't specify which tax. it sounded like a broad stroke of 'every tax is bad'. i put roads under that broad stroke because it is a tax.
It really does matter. A major part of the psychology of why whale and fish works is because there are enough people playing the game and being in the "community". Until you actually leave, you are added value to Blizz. If it wasn't, then there would be no f2p games ever. If you added no value to Blizz for playing without spending money, you wouldn't be allowed to do it.
You do you mate, no worries. I just wanted to point out, that not paying isn't automatically the same as not supporting.
they got out before it was too late!
~Nope~
If by fun you mean a grinding simulator with a weak story, I fully agree with you.
Classic just came out.
I think because of all those failures most of the players left on WoW are the ball-lickers that would rather die than leave.
they're used to dissapointment.
Well same, playing since BC but as a socialism refugee myself I feel obliged to support the fight in HK, and anyone who also went through/ is going through that hell. I completely understand though, not many people understand what's going on in the world.
On the other hand, no one is asking them for immediate closure of all their Blizzard accounts. They can play WoW all the way they want, I'm asking only for a bit more of sensibility.
Victim of poor education and/or propaganda most likely
I have what I need although not everything I want. I'm happy, relatively healthy and free. I would call it a success, while I'm still living in capitalistic society. These boundaries do not determine me.
Could you be more vague? "Capital" could be $1 sitting in your pocket. 

Your statement means nothing. But it does allude to your economic failures.
Uh... no. not even close.  
as a independent voter, I can say you have this entirely wrong. Brainwashed, much?
No "communist" country has really been communist.
Collectives that are managed by......
It can't be but I feel you know what he meant by this.
He's talking about communism. Every place that communism grows becomes dictatorship or full of censorship, police violence and all kind of bad stuff. Venezuela, Cuba, China, North Korea, old Soviet Union....
Then restrict the government, not the people.  
You get Crony Capitalism because of more restrictions being placed on capitalism, not less.  
See insulin being so fucking expensive: because almost nobody is allowed to produce it because of restrictions and regulations and copyrights, which are all restrictions on the people instead of on the government.

The United States? Or any government? Seriously? How much of the yearly budget do you think gets used on things that "almost always benefit me"? 

>He only takes 90% of the Value I create. He uses that to make sure I don't have to get sick days or reasonable vacation time

Straight up false. I don't know wtf you're talking about.
>If you added no value to Blizz for playing without spending money, you wouldn't be allowed to do it.

That's not why f2p works. F2p works because you use it to get a lot more customers that might spend money in the future. 

If a game has an upfront $60 price tag, people aren't going to buy it unless they're thoroughly convinced that they'll enjoy it. Whereas with a free to play game, people will give it a shot even if it looks just okay.

Then they play, get hooked, and end up spending a lot more than the purchase price in mtx.

I guess you could make a case where if my friends played a game and spent money on it, then me playing as a f2p with them encourages their spending because I am enhancing their experience. But the idea that some whale is only spending money because some random they don't know is playing for free? That's ridiculous.
Doesn't mean that it can't be fun. People treat games as if it's only good if you can get 500+ hours of entertainment out of them. Destiny 2 is f2p with 2 extra DLC's, that's at least 20 - 40hours of gameplay which is subjectively more fun than not.
And Private servers were always a thing.
I appreciate your sentiment. 

That said, China isn't socialist. They've practiced state capitalism for decades.
Fully agreed.
The irony in this statement is astounding.

He‚Äôs 100 percent right but the problem with people like him and me to a lesser extent is thinking we can ever lead the blind sheep when they are already so indoctrinated.

Do me a favor and go look up the history of American and European Imperialism and tell me how their domestic dispute with Hong Kong is any different than the thousands of territories we‚Äôve done hostile takeovers of.


Or better yet why anti Chinese and anti Russian sentiments have persisted for almost 40 years as they remain the only viable threats to America‚Äôs ongoing global supremacy.

Absolute sheep
Propaganda can kill even the best educated people. They don't train mental fortitude in schools sadly
I'm getting really tired of trying to explain this to people.
NA loves to call anything they don't like "communism" but have no idea what that means... It's just a buzz word and people have learned to see it as offensive and scary. That most likely comes from their relation with Russia and the media pinning every single bad thing about Russia under this word.

Same here in Canada.. Well, the population is a bit more educated on the matter but people of ages 40+ are still that way.
Local boards, mostly. 

Mind you, I'm not advocating for communism. I'm just saying China ain't it.
China is not communist (not saying if communism good or bad, that‚Äôs for each of you to think on and come up with your own idea). China is a dictatorship that will use any social and economic means to continue to seize power over its own people, including brainwashing. It has not been a communist country for decades now.
...Insulin is so expensive because one massive douchebag charges an insane amount of money for it and uses the rest of his money to prevent any regulation or restriction being put on him. Copyrights existed for a good purpose but Companies and Corporations have spent huge money twisting them into what they like and using their money to quash attempts to push back.
 
Look at Mickey Mouse for example. He is supposed to be in the Public Domain now. Most of Disney's money came from Public Domain characters but Mickey is their mascot so Disney went and got Copyright and Public Domain laws rewritten.
 
Restrictions on Capitalism is how you prevent that bullshit.
you don't seem to understand how big the US is:

> The US road network exceeds 6.58 million kilometres in total length, making it the world‚Äôs longest and biggest road network. It comprises approximately 4.3 million kilometres of paved roads including 76,334km of expressways and 2.28 million kilometres of unpaved roads. The country‚Äôs road network includes many of the world‚Äôs longest highways.

for comparison I added the rank they're listed at.

* \#1 America: 6,580,000 km
* \#14 Sweden: 579,564 km
* \#16 Finland: 454,000 km
Clean water, schooling, sewage, infrastructure, defence, policing, health regulation, industry standards, medical r&d (almost all medicine and scientific breakthroughs that are claimed by business is done by dotting i's and crossing t's from government supported university labs), major technological upgrades (see the Space Race), rental standards, etc... The government does a lot for you but it doesn't have the ability to make you less pigheaded and admit it.
 
Also the employer stealing most of the value your labour generates. That's literally a basic tenant. If you don't know what I'm talking about, I honestly applaud your willingness to be honest about your lack of education.
Some rando, no. Enough rando's is the big part. There are plenty of ways to create a demo such that it doesn't cost 80% of your upkeep just to support people who aren't paying. Most of them are much cheaper. Just look at WoW's model. F2P up to level 20. That's enough to decide if its worth playing, but doesn't end up being 80% of active players. Why the hell wouldn't Blizz do something similar on hearthstone if it didn't benefit them to have you playing anyway.
As someone who primarily cares about story and context to gameplay, Destiny satisfies nothing in terms of giving your gameplay any value. It‚Äôs all flowery language and inconsequential events that really don‚Äôt create a compelling narrative at all. It could possibly be fun, but what‚Äôs the point of playing for 10 hours to 500+ hours when your gameplay means pretty much nothing.
Yep. This may come as a surprise, but even though you presented that as if it were in conflict with what I said, it's not.
You're right; they are ruled by a single party that by law, if you live in China, you have to vote for; and that party is the Communist Party.
"*real communism has never been tried before guys*"

\-every communist ever
True. Thankfully, most "western" countries don't roll with really anything heavier than really somewhat obviously biased news channels. And a good education can help teach one to think critically, and not to just take everything at face value. I know I was taught that at least, checking sources and whatnot. Though I do admit, most of the propaganda that I've ever been subjected to has been biased news/reporting. 

So basically nothing hardcore, I'm lucky I guess.
Yep, you're on point. Educated or not, being susceptible for indoctrination is entirely different thing.
Yeah. A dictator taking people's farms away from them so they starve isn't really communism.
It's funny in the US how afraid they are of the word socialism as well. And at the same time they passed the Farm Bill last year. That's farm socialism, plain and simple.
Because  "communism" doesn't exist and will never exist. People use the word communist to refer to any of the morons and states that attempted to implement a failed and flawed ideology. 

It's almost like words change based on real life, and the term communist is now used to refer to the dozens and dozens of countries that have tried communism and all end up fucked or genocidal. 

No one is talking about Marx's definition or Lenins or whoever when they're using the word communist or communism in todays world, or even 90 years ago.

noun

the governing body of a nation, state, or community.
Yes, because the exactly communism doesn't exist, because it also can't exist. When a country go to the communist/socialist way, it starts to break apart from the problems it have, so what happens is, the state and the people close to the state are under a capitalism way of doing things, while everyone else gets closer to a communist way of things. Companies that are big in shine often have good relationship with the state, and that's how things go, because if they don't do this, the state breaks and people run away from the country. 

 But if you really want to say that this is not communism, then sure, I can just say that every country that goes deeper in the leftist side fit those problems I stated, and this is just a description of what happens in the world. 

Yes, maybe it's communist right now, that's just because communism can't work without breaking the whole country before reaching the exact scenario it wants to get. Edit: And also yes, it need to become a dictatorship or people will just run away or fight back because of the surging problems. That's why Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea are all dictatorships, because this doesn't stand up without one.
>Every place that communism grows becomes dictatorship or full of censorship

Hmm it seems like you're agreeing with the above, but you don't like it so you try to insist that you didn't just say the same thing.

>China is a dictatorship

>It has not been a communist country for decades now.
Quite the contrary. If copyrights didn't exist , everything would be public domain. Disney wouldn't be able to stop me from using  Mickey Mouse to sell flavored drinking water to children, for example.
I am very aware of how large the US is. I also know how large and sparse the population is.

I also know that roads are currently a tiny fraction of the budget, and if you look at it closer you will see this isn't the hill you want to die on.
>  There are plenty of ways to create a demo such that it doesn't cost 80% of your upkeep just to support people who aren't paying. Most of them are much cheaper. Just look at WoW's model. F2P up to level 20. That's enough to decide if its worth playing,

It really isn't. The leveling experience is a lot different than endgame. You attract a lot more players/potential spenders with free to play rather than a "free trial"
Then it's not for you, nothing wrong about it. Games are like movies you know, different types for different people.
That was my take on it when I tried it recently. I can see why some would like it, but it's just not for me.
"Centralized economic power is communism"

-everyone who has no idea what they're talking about
Yup this, I've been told Maduro is a capitalist not a socialist and I'm like really now? When it goes bad it stops being socialism? But Hugo Ch√°vez was your New posterboy while he was executing us for dissenting and making people eat trash out of hunger??

Look at the dude saying it's capitalism, yes they did say they're applying capitalism on an economy level (I wonder why, even China realized It's beloved communism hurts economy)

But it's part of it's communism plan, they admit it's COMMUNISM, sauce: I was forced to go to a communist hearing from mainland Chinese reps or ministers idk in my country else my family would get fired from its job lol, but watch a "Marxist redditor" come quick to defend their imaginary world, to discredit what I actually LIVED.
I don‚Äôt think you got my point, man. I was not disagreeing, just clarifying an important part of your original statement. It happens through all the spectrum. Think Chile‚Äôs Pinochet or Noriega‚Äôs Panama on the side, for example.
\> It has not been a communist country for decades now 

Only because communism stops working the  second after it's implemented. No state is really communist because communism can't exist in real life, that doesn't mean we can't still use the word to refer to the countries and people who support it's (failed) implementation
If Copyrights didn't exist a ton of our modern technology wouldn't exist or you would see the re-emergence of Guilds for things like computer parts. Why would I reveal how something I built works if I can't be certain some super rich dude isn't going to steal it from under me and make sure I still benefit from my hard work.
 
Modern Copyrights are evil. Copyrights use to do good.
> this isn't the hill you want to die on.

at least it'll be paved!

anyways, it was about taxes being theft, which it isnt.
I got you, but I just get irked when I hear Destiny being praised so much for Bungie‚Äôs recent decisions regarding F2P and other improvements. The way I see it is that for Bungie to actually get newer players is to go the route that they did, because the people who would buy the game have already bought it. It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre necessarily doing it to do right by their community like how many people are claiming.
they need a capitalistic economy to substent their communist policies...
I just want capitalism and decent social policies. Is that too much to ask for?
Yes, actually I was commenting in other conversation and got messed up in the comments, my bad xD misread who I was answering actually. 

But anyway, these problems came from the original system anyway, because of the leftists ideas. I just hope people just don't forget this and start playing the games again a week later or something, because that way they're just getting away with things like this.
You're somewhat seeing my point, but still trying to twist it.  


If copyrights didn't exist, what's stopping me from collaborating with Acme Small Computers to make a chip that while similar to Intel's, is vastly ahead of it's time?  


And you do realize that you can protect a trade secret without needing a copyright, correct?
It absolutely is. By any definition. They are compulsory, taken by force, and you are punished if you attempt to not pay.

If a civilian tries that, they get charged with racketeering.

EDIT:
"Theft is often defined as the unauthorized taking of property from another with the intent to permanently deprive them of it"

https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/theft-overview.html

"Theft is defined as the physical removal of an object that is capable of being stolen without the consent of the owner and with the intention of depriving the owner of it permanently. The thief need not intend to keep the property himself; an intention to destroy it, sell it, or abandon it in circumstances where it will not be found is sufficient."

"the act of stealing; the wrongful taking and carrying away of the personal goods or property of another; larceny."

Your next move is to try to argue for the Social Contract.
That was the only route only fanboys think otherwise. Game is still ridiculously overpriced. If I want to unlock 100% of the game content it costs at least extra 80‚Ç¨ to get Forsaken and Shadowkeep. It's a decent game, but selling every dlc for ~30‚Ç¨ and then having and mtx shop is an overkill, that's why I never got into the game seriously.
Which "communist policies" are those?
Apparently yes, I'd love that actually, lived in Scandinavia for a while and that's how it works there. Bretty good
Seriously look up why copyrights were made. Trade Secrets kind of fucked over humanity for ages. For example, in the time of Alexander we both had working steam engines and rail tracks. Steam Engines as they were would only be passed down Master to Apprentice and could not feasibly be studied and were eventually lost for several hundred years.
 
I would agree Copyrights are often inideal even before they got twisted by big business, being easily exploitable. Ask Edison on that front. I think the Copyright system has value but does need reworking.
 
Also people are working on similar chips and it was a big deal a few years ago when some company was planning a cheaper release to force down Intel's prices.
optional, as you dont have to live in the country. there are plenty of people living without paying taxes. you just have to be homeless and only barter trade for goods and services as buying anything, typically, means paying taxes.

you agree to use the public services, then you agree to taxed to keep those services running.

for property taxes. you agree to pay and they agree to allow you to use it. if you dont pay then you can't use it.
Same here, I seriously despised what Activision-Blizzard and Bungie did in terms of monetization for Destiny, and Bungie still has yet to prove that they will do better on that front.
oh, i am so sorry, i missread the ccp.

it's meant to be China's capitalist party

how can i be so dumb?
I‚Äôm from NZ, it‚Äôs pretty up there. It seems to work pretty well to me.
One of the things Alexander did not have was internet, or even the printing press, or as you pointed out, Guilds.  
A free spread of information was severely limited then.  
Nothing would stop me from showing how to make insulin or intel's chips.
> you agree to use the public services

If I didn't have to pay for the ones I don't use this would make sense. Seeing as that's not the case, it's pointless.

>property taxes

I agree to pay for something I own and they agree to give me permission to use something I own? And that makes sense to you?
I bet you also think they're a People's Republic, and that the Nazis were Socialists, because you clearly put a lot of faith in authoritarian branding.
If you think names are always 100% accurate, like you're implying here, you're gonna be super confused when you learn about the Titmouse.
That's really good lol, sorry for small chat comment but ironically a friend was checking it out to move there, and that was one of the reasons! All the best to you.
No but people would have had far less reason to ever make the thing in the first place. Lets say we didn't have Copyrights but people still eventually worked their way through how to make these things and did, keeping it secret in a format like a Guild. How much of their resources would be spent fighting the internet ever making it into homes to restrict that information.
 
Copyrights with all their stupid restrictions did make the information about what people built why and how FAR more accessible because people were willing to publicize it
No one owns land. That‚Äôs owned by the government and leased to states and public.
it's one thing to brand yourself as something you are not because it helps public appeareance:

\-like antifa which is the opposite of the name

\-or the democratic party that is against democracy

&#x200B;

it's another not being able to recognize when the brand fits the policies...

may i refer you to the state controlling everything from economics, to SPEECH, to privacy and data gathering, to human rights, the means of production, you know, the small things that "totally not-communist" prefer to control.
No problem, have a good life üòÅ
You underestimate humanity's want to succeed and overcome.
Not just land.

And you support this.

Did you know it costs $5/month to be employed in the city of Denver? It's called a "Privilege Tax"
So to recap:

1. You don't know what words mean, and

2. You believe proven liars' versions of events.

Good day to you.
So then, what is the difference between fascism and communism? Both rely on authoritarian governments. Both strangle liberty, but they're strangely at opposite ends of the political spectrum. What is the difference, and which do you support?
No I just have historical accounts of how much and how badly that will gets exploited
If you don‚Äôt support it then find places without it. 

I‚Äôm ok with shared expenses.
so to recap your recap:

\-you have no idea what you're talking about (or you do and just don't want to admit basic truths)

\-you became the proven liar you despised so much.

bad day to you, sadly didn't earn the good one uwu.
Not really. You yourself have been arguing against additional government, you just don't really know it.

I love WoW and this really hurts right now

Hate to break it to you but Roblox is partnered with tencent. They also have a foot in China and haven't made any statement supporting human rights.

Not all heros wear capes.
So let me get this straight.

You saw a WoW card, decided to whip out your camera, record yourself moving a different card in front of the the WoW card, in order to get karma on reddit.

Are you going to do this for *every* store that has this display and post it on reddit? I get the boycott but eesh, /r/cringe.
I know I am!  Renewed my wow sub. Bought some ow loot boxes. Even put money into hots.
Well boys, we did it. Activision-Blizzard is no more
Wow, your actions really helped the struggle in Hong Kong.  
What a martyr you are, grow up and let people make their own choices.  


I for one still happily play WoW because the struggle in Hong Kong is a problem for the people in Hong Kong.
Yeah that‚Äôll show em
I‚Äôm impressed of how much no difference this makes
China destroyed, HK liberated
Doing your part by trolling the poor bloke who's gotta inventory those cards?
I just wanna throw this out there and while I know some of you may know I side with the streamers on this I want to be clear. Blizzard is a business and any business is going to do what is the profitable choice when they are given the options so long as what they're doing isn't illegal. So they made the best business decision they could make. But they most definitely didn't make the right choice when it came to what's right or wrong. That being said as someone who's worked with their team I can tell you they aren't bad people and this isn't something that reflects the entire company and all of it's employees. It's the person who made the call that should be frowned upon here if yall are going to be pointing the finger. 

&#x200B;

I say this with experience and knowledge from college business courses and working with companies. 

&#x200B;

Sorry that a company did something that companies do but when it comes to money time and time again through out history so long as it's not illegal a company/business will chose the most profitable option every time without a doubt.
Please don't be the ass hole who does this and makes it some stupid trend.

How Roblox is that popular? I literally never heard of it until on a video a few weeks ago. Could be that just is not played in EU?
This is just silly ofcourse he gets banned for pushing political opinion in a VIDEO GAME tournament. yes its for a good cause but how would you feel if they had to allow people to have their political opinions there and some neonazi comes up. grow up people blizzard is a company not your buddy.

roblox good
Lmao no, I'm not. I'm not gonna play a shittier game because capitalism sucks.

You wanna help Blizzard's actions regarding HK?

Change our worship of money.
Can someone please explain? i'm confused
Yes, fight the Chinese lackey with the white supremacist recruiting tool for children.
I cringed at the immaturity of this
I bought a game card like a week before shit went down and it's like..  .they already have my money, do I play or not.
Yeah! This will hit them where it hurts /rollseyes
Godspeed, hero.
Way to make it harder for the people who work in retail. You do know those cards are already paid for in wholesale and the profits you are now denying is the store trying to sell them right? SMH
Wow I can see the news title now! ‚ÄúGrown man puts Roblox gift card in front of WoW one, Chinese government capitulates.‚Äù Yet another low effort circlejerk karma whoring post. You are a disgrace and are using the actual human suffering in Hong Kong to gain fake internet points, congratulations.
*oh man you're literally changing the world!*
This is stupid
What people fail to understand is that even if blizzard goes against china openly then the things happening in Hong Kong are not going to stop.

Blizzard cant do anything to stop them, not on their own.


Hell if even chinese themselves can't do shit for it (and we're talking about BILIONS of people) you might aswell understand that 4700 people wont change anything.


EVERYONE has to stand up and drop them so that they'd be left alone with no international market unless things change, and that, is not something 1 industry alone can do.

Blizzard taking action wasnt a way to support what the Chinese government is doing, Blizzard action was something to PROTECT themselves from having a hard drop in income by getting banned in china.

Again, it doesnt mean Blizzard supports them, it means Blizzard can't do shit on their own without risking to to bankrupt since China is the biggest country there is and the gaming scene there is so huge that you'd be losing more money than what you earn.


I'm saying this as someone who has never played a blizzard game beside overwatch, so you cant even define me as a blizzard cocksucker or however you call them.

You people need to understand the way the world goes, nothing is as easy as you think it is and, even if it sucks, there's nothing we can do unless plenty of other industries and companies take actions on that.
Congrats, you beat China.
So edgy!
Yeah im thinking of pre purchasing war3 refirged
As much as I dislike Blizzard, Roblox seems to be increasing the chance your child grows up mentally deficit as well.

Would you like to know more?

Ah so you can assume that the components come from overseas.  But there is no way for me to know otherwise?  Why dont you think about that for a minute.  Burden of proof is on the accuser as they say.
Somehow I always thought Roblox would overtake WoW and now here we are. Roblox > Overwatch
This whole situation sucks, I loved blizzard since wow vanilla came out and have been playing their games since, I enjoy most of their games and do have an active wow subscription. It ends in a few days so I might just wait out the situation to see if I should purchase more or not. This has severely wrecked blizzards reputation
THERE GOES MY HERO
stop
I'm never going to waste one second of my life on roblox ever
I‚Äôve never seen wow cards stacked with such numbers before lol
Classic Roblox servers when?
Source store. Nice.
Add a second card just in case someone decided to get robux from game(stop)
This gave such a starship troopers vibe!
I stopped playing blizzard games since this happened!
Derp derp derp I cancel my subs and oppose blizzard for supporting evil China. Me have selective outrage because me cant think clearly. Me hate blizzard now but like other games like Roblox derp derp herp me support Roblox is good company.

I‚Äôm doing my part!
My blizzard game with the most time on it used to be destiny but now all I had there was hearthstone. It has been uninstalled and blizzard removed from my PC
The hero we need but do not deserve!
Here is a more effective bit of sabotage. Collect them all and hide them in another part of the store behind completely different merchandise.
Hahahahahahaha. It is very cool see the youth doing something like this as long as you guys do not go to far and get innocent people fired just because you disagree with them, but this is different of course.
The thumbs up, lovin it !
As much as I love overwatch, I'm not going to play a single game from them unless they fix this...which is unlikely seeing they have backed themselves into a corner.
hahahah ok i got a good laugh on that. I'm sure those blizz gift cards wont be noticed for a long while.
DONT LET THE FLAME DIE OUT
I just unsubscribed. I feel like right now blizzard no longer represents my interests as a gamer. I'll be watching to see how this continues to play out.
the post itself is hella funny but the people getting irrationally mad at this in the comments really makes it
Good message, but the retail employees are gonna be pissed lol (I currently work in retail and it always makes me wonder why people pick something up and place it beside the item instead of where it belongs).
This is the most effective market tatic i'ver seen.
You made that look difficult...

Would stealing gift cards actually be a crime? It says right on most cards that they have NO VALUE until activated by a cashier. So, how is taking something of no value from a store a crime? Maybe someone in law enforcement can answer this. Pretty much a daft question.

EDIT: so I get downvoted for asking a legitiment question. People really suck.
OP is getting a lot of hate from people that a missing one important thing.  Many of those cards are just "promotional" and have no value other than to bring it to the counter so the employee can fetch the actual card with the scratch code from the drawer/cabinet/back room.  If it does contain a code on the promo card, it requires activation and has zero value otherwise, and payment usually happens on activation.

Source: Worked at far too many places with such cards.
Even if people think this is dumb and pointless, it's at least a small thing, which is more than doing nothing
Most blizzard games don't like my pc atm so I play them very little atm
Yet people will still pay/support this corrupted company, just to have their share of entertainment (especially wow players). They don't realize that, if you still have an account, you are supporting the exact things you are against. Disgusted.
u respect da roblox community

&#x200B;

thank u
Howdy Blizz-Brother!

Just wanted to chime in that you are not alone. This whole thing happened just before my decision to move to vanilla from retail, but I still felt strongly enough to cancel my sub and remove [battle.net](https://battle.net) from my pc (the games are still on my hds, don't see the point of deleting them yet). I do plan on returning, but I want to see an apology of sorts from Blizzard first. I'm happy to wait until that day comes.

I can't in good conscience give money to a company that supports a fascist 'communist' dictatorship over the basic human right to freedom of speech of their own loyal fanbase. 

I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in a company, and that's saying something (looking at you, EA gambling)
I deleted my account. I was an active overwatch player but I tried playing the day after they banned Blitzchung and I just felt guilty. Even if I wasn‚Äôt buying anything, me playing the game was supporting the company by making their matchmaking pool bigger. After their pseudo apology, I realized I couldn‚Äôt support the company going forward and decided to delete my account. It was tough because I own all of their games and poured a lot of time into WoW, Diablo and Overwatch but I don‚Äôt see Blizzard changing their position on this one. It‚Äôs sad a company I‚Äôve supported for 25 years had to be so shitty and greedy I couldn‚Äôt enjoy their games anymore.
So much of my life has been wasted on WoW... I‚Äôd never delete my account. Seems extreme, especially if they make an apology. So I‚Äôm just gonna have to buy the games again if that happens?
Cancelled my subscription, I will not resubscribe until they do something to change my view on them.
Many of us are in the same boat. I grew up with Blizzard from the early days and have paid for every game they have developed just because "it is Blizzard". I have bought the virtual ticket to every single Blizzcon possible and this hurts so much. 

I have not deleted anything but I have quit playing all Blizzard games and canceled my WoW sub. I need to see something from Blizzard showing they really know this is fucked up.
I‚Äôm not deleting anything except my card info from my account. I won‚Äôt be paying them another cent, by my old blizzard games are MINE and I don‚Äôt want to lose them.
If you don't play, you can either unsub manually, so that you can submit a message, or uninstall the Blizzard Client (don't worry, wow won't uninstall) so that their statistics show that.
It's fine, I did not delete mine either, but I've committed to not touching it until we get a real solution.

I'm sure they are betting on most people getting tired by Blizzcon, and swayed back by announcements like the new WoW expansion, Diablo 4, or WC3 reforged.

Do not yield. Don't even give their stream a view, any news site will cover all the reveals the second they happen. Do not be tempted to come back no matter how cool things look.
Fair enough, I‚Äôm equally disgusted. Such wonderful memories and enjoyment from Blizzard. I have to remind myself, this is NOT blizzard anymore. It helps... a tiny bit
Looking at viewer counts on twitch nothing has changed. Except I am saving tons of money having quit hearthstone. :3
I feel bad. It is like being angry at a family member. You can‚Äôt accept their position but hate that it is pushing you apart.

I want to buy the Blizzcon stream but can‚Äôt justify supporting Blizzard.
I already canceled but I‚Äôm playing it out to the end of my subscription. Not sure if I should have uninstalled but I think Blizzard cares about their $$$ taking a dip more than the number of active players, but who can say. 

I‚Äôm also using the opportunity to spread the word without spamming - just making the occasional joke or meme in general and when people ask for clarification I explain. Basically keeping it in the conversation. It‚Äôs shocking how many players on my server have no idea and don‚Äôt follow the news, but are very open to hearing about it. 

On a side note, one of my lame jokes in general chat was that someone should make a <Liberate Hong Kong> guild and see if Blizzard gm‚Äôs ban them. I was a member of one of the largest Alliance guilds on my server, The Goonies, and they banned me for criticizing the Chinese government for ‚Äúracism‚Äù:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dhl0sz/one_of_the_largest_guilds_windseeker_just_banned/
True.  This may sound mean but I think it is outright stupid to delete an account due to this, with the reason being that you already paid money, so just stop giving them money.  That means letting your wow sub lapse but you can still play diablo just dont buy any future games.

A boycott is for purely economical terms, and in no uncertain terms, just means stop buying from them.

With all that said, i am with hong kong and am waiting for blizzard to apologize and give blitzchung back his seat.  Besides that i let my wow sub lapse and have stopped playing blizz games all together, but if i want i might go back to diablo
I'm lucky enough that I hadn't started playing before all this happened, but I was going to get Overwatch when it came to Switch. Not anymore. I want them to completely change their actions before I give them a cent of my money.
Something big is definitely happening at Blizzcon.

Not because of the Blitzchung controversy, but more likely because of how lackluster and how much of a joke Blizzcon 2018 was.

There will be MANY new game reveals.  New WoW expansion, OW2, D4 at the very least.

But if we are so easily appeased by such (albeit exciting) news, then maybe we were never that dedicated to supporting HK and boycotting Blizzard from the beginning.

Remember the criticism of Blizzard:  they only support social progress and causes when doing so cost them nothing.

That's no support at all.

Careful not to do the same ourselves:  that we only boycott Blizzard until a game we are excited about comes out.

That's no boycott at all.
How about a normal blizzcon for the sake of the ppl going.. thanks
I deleted the account I had since 2010. That said, its perfectly fine not deleting anything. It's your choice. Support however you can.
This all happened right after I joined my colleges Overwatch esports team. Great timing lol
I just wanted to congratulate you for not playing WoW! High five, takes some balls.
Hey man, lets not forget that the people at Blizzcon aren‚Äôt the people who are responsible for this. It‚Äôs still okay for fans to support games they love made by people who love to make em‚Äô. The devs in LA aren‚Äôt the Chinese government.
Psh. I‚Äôm still playing because I like the games. Don‚Äôt give a shit about the company. 

What‚Äôs also funny, is the insane amount of people playing cod mobile. Made in china, having an activision brand. People are just stupid. Post this stuff for karma points only. Then continue to ‚Äúnot play wow‚Äù or ‚Äúnot play black ops 4‚Äù yeah right. 
I‚Äôm sure some people actually boycotted. But let‚Äôs be real, Reddit is small compared to blizzard game owners. And reddit is filled with *ill follow the trend bruh* people.
You could say it's a... shituation
just play a private server
Play a private server
There's already a big protest planned at Blizzcon with a [website up](https://www.gamersforfreedom.com/) and everything.
> I hope something big blows up with Blizzcon

Phrasing.
Coward
> Im not deleting anything

To be fair..... Blizzard's not letting a lot of folks delete their accounts even if they want to.

I dont think they banned anyone for speaking yet
> Hate to break it to you but Roblox is partnered with tencent. They also have a foot in China and haven't made any statement supporting human rights.

Its hilarious that people are boycotting Blizzard and not other companies. Literally 2IQ echo chamber fuckwits.
I just picked whatever card was next to it, unfortunately I didn't do my research on every company's position on China.
And even if they weren't. The only ones being hurt by this is the local store where he did this.

Some guy comes in to buy a Game time and can't find it because of the Roblox card, he goes elsewhere. Or buys it online. Hiding the card will at best delay the purchase from a determined customer (No one impulse buys gametime) and at worst cause them to buy it directly from the Blizzard store instead where they get a better margin.
Let‚Äôs just mission creep our way to a point of such generalization that nothing has enough of an effect to matter!  Being focused gets the job done. Don‚Äôt be pedantic. We‚Äôre talking to Blizzard right now.
But Epic Games CEO did, and Tencent owns 40% of Epic Games.
I wear capes sometimes
This one might as well wear it.
if this is how you define hero, words fail me.
sometimes they wear fedoras
congratulations, you found the joke
if the guy whipped out a MAGA hat and started talking about immigration, and Blizzard banned him, all these fools would be cheering
Soon the CCP will come for you and nobody will be left to speak up for you.  
EDIT: Good to see Blizzard fans care more about their Overwatch loot boxes than human rights.
If these people actually gave a shit about whats happening in Hong Kong surely they'd be doing a lot more than talking about it on the internet? Surely?
I highly doubt you **happily** play WoW still.
No one inventories those cards. They aren't active until they're scanned at the register. People walk out with them all the time to keep as gifts to activate later because of this. And even this is rare. 

Companies that put these cards out, dont care either. They're usually made of cheap ass plastic or cardstock. 

Shops literally only care to order more when they're running low.
If it makes you feel better I work there so I'm the poor bloke
mate chill, they're not doing inventory on gift cards that don't even have money on them. The cards themselves are worthless until they are activated
I don‚Äôt think 1 card is going to piss anyone off doing inventory...5+ cars sure but 1 card you take 1 second moving back over is harmless.
This. I wish folks like OP know that his action is just like the PRCs who vandalized Japanese car brands in China - they think they are harming Japan when all they are doing is to hurt their countrymen
Most of those "poor blokes" are looking for something to do till work time is over. This is perfect.
> Blizzard is a business and any business is going to do what is the profitable choice when they are given the options so long as what they're doing isn't illegal.

No, _some_ businesses do that. Not all. Some actually mean it when they say they have principles and values. 

It is perfectly valid to hold a business or corporation to moral standards and expect or demand that ethical behaviour from them -- even when that ethical behaviour might make a dent in their bottom line.
It's really strange how corporations have somehow managed to trick us into defending their horrible actions. 

>Bob makes tshirts, he uses third world child slave labor to have lower costs. Bob is evil

>Company makes tshirts, they use third world child slave labor to have lower costs. bUsInEsSeS wOrK fOr PrOfIt 

People know businesses try to make profit, its not a surprise to anyone. However people place trust into certain brands and uphold them to standards when repeatedly supporting them. If that trust is broken then that company loses the loyalty of those customers. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with this happening because it somewhat restricts companies to some moral standards.  

When I used to buy blizzard games I was okay with overlooking some anticonstumer stuff because I trusted the company. Now however I've removed that trust (its slowly been going away over the years) and highly doubt I'll ever touch another blizzard product.

This ridiculous idea that companies should be continue to receive our support for being greedy doesn't make sense. If I have a choice to support a morally sound company I'll chose that one over an evil one every time (It's video games so gladly my choices are very expansive). 

Blizzard did something shitty, it doesnt matter if they're a company. Continue supporting them if its not a big deal to you but don't try to write off their behavior.
Then it's our job to make doing the wrong thing less profitable.

They can choose me or China.  They're apparently not getting both.
While I understand your point, you're not entirely correct imo.

Business don't always make the most profitable decision, case in point Google decided to pull out of China  entirely 9 years ago due to similar ethical problems and have undoubtedly lost a lot of profit as a result. It is possible for companies to put morals over profits and its well within the consumers rights to choose what products they buy into based on these morals.

Additionally the Blizzard situation is a bit more complicated than making the best business decision imo. I think they could have have easily dealt with the situation in such a way that satisfied China without clearly taking a stance on the political issue at hand. Had they just removed the vod, given the player a slap on the wrist punishment and said "regardless of the message, we don't want our platform to be taken over by political agendas" I doubt there would be anywhere near as much uproar on the issue.

The problem I have (and presumably many others) is that they have not taken a neutral stance on the political issue at hand imo, but instead seem to have very heavily taken the side of an authoritarian government vs a freedom movement.

I 100% agree with you though that this doesn't reflect on the staff working at Blizzard. It's asinine to think the developers of the games have any responsibility to a political/management action taken on the other side of the world. But it does reflect on the company's ethics as a whole, and the priorities of those with the power to make decisions.

Don‚Äôt even try to use common sense on reddit, just embrace the outrage culture or else be prepared to lose fake internet points.
Yes, companies go for profit, it's their purpose. But still this doesn't mean they are soulless constructs completely detached of any understanding of humanism. After all, economics and businesses are there to give human existence a structure and a better quality of life. If you think you should make money off of the suffering of other people, then you have failed as company, and as individual.
Just to be clear I'm not stating that there are only two options that exist. Also there's no way for us to discuss the specifics they considered so I can't sit here and detail all the options Blizzard had to chose from being that I don't have such internal knowledge and if I did I wouldn't be able to disclose that due to their own company policies pertaining to such things.

As to all the other replies saying some businesses do that or things such as not all companies should do that e.c.t.. yeah that might be true but this isn't just any company. We're talking about a specific company not other businesses or some businesses. It's a larger discussion to discuss what companies should and shouldn't do when it comes to ethical decisions and organizational behavior.

We're discussing a specific business choice that was made by a specific company for a specific reason(s) which we can only assume was based off of profit or the good of the company because when Blizzard has hundreds of millions of dollars in potential profit that hang on Blizzard choosing to do something Blizzard is going to chose what makes them the most money because telling share-holders we chose not making hundreds of millions in profit and to instead become closed off to billions of potential customers it doesn't sound good to investors.

They care about their investors so they're going to make the choices that best benefit their investors. Also there's probably various equations which were solved by a variety of well-paid professionals who analyzed the situation and decided this was the best path forward for the company. Also you have to consider the safety of those who are working for Blizzard in China if all of a sudden they're now seen as slanderers of the state based off of Blizzard taking a stand. So while you and I would want Blizzard to take a stand against China and support those people going through a bunch of BS that's not something that they're company is designed to do.

They are first of foremost a video game company so for them to step into politics in a foreign country would not be appropriate because it's beyond their area of expertise.

Though if they had subject matter experts hired to their team to analyze the politics of a foreign nation so that they could take a stand in a way that wouldn't negatively impact their business in China they'd be capable of making educated decisions that were acceptable and not cause such an uproar.
The ‚Äúvictims‚Äù also broke their contract
Lol, a couple decades back and Blizzard would have been run into the ground for supporting a communist dictatorship.
Blizzard did not start that way. Particularly since Activision they became that.
You said it all.
A good business follows ethical and moral understanding... not to mention when the whole base tells you diablo immortal was a stupid move... its best you be a good business and listen
"Eh they had to chase profit so it's ok they endorse authoritarians who are denying human rights.

THis will look terrible when tiannamen 2 happens.
Considering some of the changes coming to China and data security over there we very well might see entities like Bliz decide to jump ship on the market anyways. 1 Billion customers is great and all but not if you have to transmit all your server and login data unencrypted so the government can spy on it.
What do you think / feel about IBM making early computers to help Germany manage arresting Jews?
hello blizzard employee
amazing how taking a class at a community college and working the fryer at McDonald's makes you an expert on business
One can only dream
Why not though? It's essentially harmless
you've been living under a rock deep within a mountain range, it's massive.
life has always been about choosing the lesser evil; this is just another time where this seems the case.
If you think you will have fun, go ahead, as you said, they already have your money, nothing will change from now on.
No, the only logical choice is to burn it after you apready paid for it
I work in retail. These cards have zero monetary value until loaded at check out. This is to prevent loss from theft.
Well the less they sell, the less they have to restock.

I think OP is just trying to make a statement more than anything though.
Yeah but the way stores know what to buy more of is if the stuff they're selling actually sells. So although they've already bought this shipping of cards, if these ones don't sell then they won't buy anymore (because they realise it's not profitable), which hurts blizzard if even a tiny bit
You got me fam
I did a thing!!!
Yup. https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/eyeing-an-entry-into-china-roblox-enters-strategic-partnership-with-tencent/

China has ownership in everything
It sure is
No one is expecting Blizzard to stop anything by themselves...or really help end it...they could have done literally nothing and everyone would have been happy. By trying to defend China they've gained nothing but lost quite a bit. Had they just kept quiet and not made a fuss they could have continued to happily play both sides.
I'd still tell off a thief for stealing, even if it won't stop all thieves in the world.
>	it means Blizzard can‚Äôt do shit on their own without risking to to bankrupt since China is the biggest country there is and the gaming scene there is so huge that you‚Äôd be losing more money than what you earn.

Doesn't the SE Asia region account for around 12 percent of their revenue?

Didnt they make record profits last year and now even have less expenses due to laying off 800 people? 8 percent of their employees.

ÔøºThey would not go bankrupt from losing less than 10% of their revenue when making record profits and having cut down 8% of the most expensive part of business, employees.Ôøº

They would make less money, which greed obviously finds unacceptable.Ôøº
Let's not exaggerate here.

Their income from that region is less than 20% overall.
Not having China would *not* bankrupt them.

Loss of potential revenue, sure. Bankrupt? Not even close.
I dont get it.  Is it a like minecraft but on crack?
FINALLY.  I was surfing the comments for this.  

The only good bug is a dead bug.
Kids without cards.
Unless it says free it's not. 

If you walk into someone's house and take something because it has no price is that stealing?

The answer is yes. Because it's not your property until it's transferred. 

It's technically illegal to rummage though someone else's garbarge without their consent.
I'm sure legally anything and everything has some form of value, in this case the 0.2 cents the cardboard itself cost which would still count as theft of property and they're still losing potential income by not having that card to sell.
To answer your question, I'd say that yes, it is stealing.  
But would there be consequences? Maybe not.  

Keep in mind that, although they do not hold any value, they are still the store's property and taking anything from the store is stealing.  

Stealing is about taking without consent, not about value.  

I worked 9 years in a convenience store and we had to get the police involved because a son (mid 30) and his dad would always come in and steal sugar packets. Yes, those sugar packets right next to the coffee machine.  

They'd buy stuff and grab a handful of sugar packets, without the coffee, and my boss told them to stop, they didn't, so the police was involved.  

6 years later they're still banned from that store.  

I'd think that taking one card just for "the fun of it", wouldn't be an issue. But taking a whole bunch of cards? That might annoy an owner and make him want to enforce his right.
Wow what a hero, he really saved the people of Hong Kong! That‚Äôll show those businessmen and their Chinese overlords! Keep on fighting the good fight my circlejerking friends!
Actually it is the same as nothing.
A person like you who's feelings are hurt and would love to make a company go under and 10's of thousands of people get laid off because in your heart its more right to punish all the developers and people who had NO part in this and are honest hard working people?  That is disgusting. You really should be ashamed at wanting people to lose their jobs for something one guy that makes up 0.0001% of their employees did. Please refrain from joining politics with your mindset.

Blizzard isn't a Chinese company. Not buying Blizzard products will not stop the Chinese Government from breaking peoples arms and running them over with tanks till they turn to mush.

Remember this as you read this reply from a product that was manufactured in China.
You know how much difference deleting your Blizzard account makes? Something between 0 and 0.
Honestly, the amount of time people have spend in games like wow or diablo, id never expect someone to delete their account for this cause. To much work wasted.
>I can't in good conscience give money to a company that supports a fascist 'communist' dictatorship over the basic human right to freedom of speech of their own loyal fanbase

Same
what a load of bullshit
I doubt you'll be seeing an apology, especially after their statement made friday, and the fact that blitz has pretty much made up with them. While i agree that initial punishment was extreme, they are a business, and are beholden to their shareholders interests.
Cries in 6 month prepay
[deleted]
They did technically apologize already and gave blitzchung his money back and halved his ban
stop paying the US government. they support Saudi Arabia, a religious nutjob of a country that kills gay people
Exactly that. Though if you can't afford that then don't delete it. Personally deleted and wrote a letter saying I'd happily buy the games again if they apologized and made clear they value freedom from oppression and freedom to criticize your government, but that anyone doing it on their tourney will be banned. That's all I want.
There are so many good games out there. I was like you, until I realized Blizzard has been dead for a decade now. They're inability to develop anything new has been a serious problem for a long time. The problems began with SC2 and D3. They've only gotten worse since then.

Try other games and you won't look back at Blizzard, trust me!
Well... technically they are not. You have revocable licenses to play those games.
We need to remember a lot of Blizzard employees are really upset about the way this was handled and side with fans.  It‚Äôs their livelihood and passion to make great games and they can‚Äôt just quit. 

However, the folks responsible for this will be at BlizzCon. It‚Äôs a fine line to walk but we should support the devs and question the leadership. 

It‚Äôs important to show Blizzard that their player base values freedom of speech, liberty, and transparency.

Sucks you got downvoted but it's the truth. I'll still keep playing. I honestly think most of the people are just doing this to be part of the trend and in another week when this dies down, they'll be back to subbing to WoW or regret deleting their account. 

EVERYONE in my guild had the same exact reaction to the situation which was "get rekt HK lmao" or something to that effect.
Well paying for the games or giving them money. Is in a way saying you support their censorship. That's the entire point why people don't want to support the company.
As long as you brush your teeth after... all good :)
They baned me when I sayed damn üò°üò°
I don't think anyone was banned because they expressed their political convictions in a Blizzard game according to the rules. He was not allowed to express any political belief at this event. No one gets banned ingame.
If you dont think that Blitzchung should have received any punishment at all then you are just oblivious to your own political bias.
Hey, it‚Äôs a question of raising awareness! Before this happen I personally have never heard anything about Tencent or Chinese investments in general. But this incident pushed me to do research, and now I can make more informed decisions! So I suggest we spread information instead of calling people names. More useful and more powerful than calling people fuckwits, I think.
Reductionist views don't help. There's a ton of factors and for you to pretend that you have any sort of grasp of what any given person is doing is arrogant at best. You don't know the extent people are going to, and it really doesn't matter because whether or not Redditors are proceeding *ideally* shouldn't be the main focus of a bunch of people coming together to do their best with the hand they're dealt to educate themselves and others about oppression. Like, you realize you're doing less, right? Being the dude who bitches and moans about people bitching and moaning isn't ideal either.
it's more hilarious that people are claiming that they "did their part" while doing nothing at all.
They'd have to boycott all of Epic since it's the biggest Tencent share and all the games made with UE4 (which is a shit ton these days).
Exactly my problem with all this drama.  
I just don't understand the hate against a single company who just wanted to keep their gaming community safe from politics and such stuff.
If this is how you react to non-offensive jokes I have some bad news for you.
Never.
Thanks. Where my trophy?
Play stupid games win stupid prizes, private companies dont need to give your a platform, huehuehue.
Very happily, 8.3 is looking great!
>People walk out with them all the time to keep as gifts to activate later because of this. And even this is rare.

So which is it? It can either happen all the time, or it can be rare, not both
open your mouth, I want to smell what brand of polish you bought.
Did you really just compare this video to that? Because not only are you completely ignorant for that, the cards aren't worth anything until purchased. So how exactly is it hurting their countrymen?
Oh boy, I get to spend 2 seconds moving a card over and wonder what weirdo would put the card back on the wrong peg. That really cuts down my 8 hour shift.
I, personally, am annoyed whenever I see product in the wrong place. How hard is it to put the paint brush back in the same box you grabbed it from?
Yea, perhaps someone could get a righty oh laughin' when they see what has been done.
And on the other end some companies don't actually care for legality if profits outweigh the punishment that'd follow when caught. Companies are really only as good as the people leading them.
Exactly, a company may make the morally wrong choice for profit, but it's entirely within the consumers rights to not buy from a company they deem unethical.

I can buy fairtrade food because I want to support workers in developing countries. I can boycott nestle (or try to) because of their unethical water hoarding practices. Yes its a business working for profit doing the most profitable business decision. No I don't want to support it.

Boycotting Blizzard is just the same thing. Are they within their legal rights to do what they did? Yes. Do I want to support them now? No.
> It's really strange how corporations have somehow managed to trick us into defending their horrible actions.

I agree, I hate the "a company is obligated to make as much profit as possible so their actions are justified" fanboy argument.

Obviously companies have to be competitive in a capitalist market and profit is a measure of that success, but that doesn't mean  that they are validated in ignoring moral and ethical standards to do so just because they are inside the law. The whole justification for a free-market in general is that it is for the welfare of a whole society, but the system can only work in a society that isn't chaotic and corrupt. The law isn't the end-all be-all when it comes to ethical boundaries, because the law will never be able to address every aspect of business and also has a hard time catching up to this fast changing world. There are gray areas where a company needs to self-regulate themselves to determine what's right and in Blizzard's case, they made a choice that I can't support and will say goodbye to SC2 as a result.
How is choosing the cheeper legal option greedy? Is it greedy every time I buy food I choose the store brand? Is it greedy if I the company I work for buys bags from a company who sells them for 35 cents each as opposed to 40 from a different company? Business is about making money. Making money means you save cost in other areasm if it's legal who are you to call it "greedy"?
For all you know saving money in one spot allows them to pay higher wages.
Trust me they will choose China.  People act like its even in question if it comes down to it...
Oh noo, what are they gonna do?
The virtue signallers will be back in a week.
This guy uses the real common sense.
Guess who had to sign all the paperwork to let the activision merger happen?  Blizz lawyers/employees.    If it wasn't activision it would have been someone else.  People don't just merge companies for shits and giggles.  They were looking for this.
I doubt it will become a trend. I am just amazed on how naive someone can be to believe that a trend on the internet will remain harmless and won't be exaggerated into extremes.
I was trying to be more informative than judgemental. The issues on Roblox aren't getting nearly as much press.
They still got my money though, that's the problem here.
Yup, I had an issue come up where some cards were on display that had the wrong ESRB rating. I told my manager, he said to literally just shred them and they'd order new ones. They have no value at all just sitting on a peg, it's just printed cardboard.
So just don't buy them 4Head
China owns this comment.
I just picked whatever card was next to it apologize for not researching before performing slactivist things
So might as well not even try then, Right?
But they weren't defending China. They were just trying to keep politics out no?



This seems to be the largest misconception about this situation. People in their heads have already decided that blizzard was doing the bidding of the Chinese government, but really it had nothing to do with the Hong Kong situation.
They could have done nothing and they ghosted the dude.  Might be dramatic but from what I hear it's in the wheelhouse.
But this situation is nothing like that. Blizzard gets more money like this, and they couldn't save Honk Kong anyways.
Dont you have a phone?
The Asia-Pacific region accounts for 10% of Activision Blizzard revenue. So not only China.

It's around ~1/3rd of Blizzard revenue.
How would you feel if you lost 20% of your income?
Almost all of their investment and development costs for new products are targeted at this market. 

If you think the loss of that future revenue plus the loss of years of development costs with virtually no return would be a serious problem that‚Äôs pretty ignorant. 

That said, at some point principles need to outweigh profits and if not happy with how Blizz has handled this.
A game engine. Started off as an indie game and slowly mutated into whatever it is today.
I expect the best and I give the best üòé
Buddy. You are missing the point. The card literally says that IT HAS NO VALUE. Sure, there is a law with garbage. But what about gift cards.

Plus, no shit you can‚Äôt go into someone‚Äôs house and take things. That is breaking and entering.
Ok. But it says it has no value. Not that it‚Äôs worth 0.2 cents.
Thank you! I love this intelligent, thought out response.
Don't worry, the "easily triggered" phase will fade as you get older and more experienced, so you can look forward to that.  Until then, keep on trolling :P
you see friend, 0.00000001 > 0

You can't change the maths
Keep lying to yourself.
At the end of the day its just a game, i played wow sincd beta. And am a huge SC fan.

All gone, other games to play.
I wouldn't expect anyone to do it but some feel it's important enough. Sometimes it's good to recognize a fruitless cause. I'd love to be proven wrong, but I don't ever see Blizzard(Activision) coming back with enough of an apology and correction of direction to outweigh the way they played their cards here.
I have over 10,000 hours of /played time in WoW. I have put many hours into Hearthstone, HoTS, Overwatch, D3, and Starcraft 64. I have been playing Blizzard games for longer than my memory can go back.

This whole event has been so heartbreaking, and I just have not been able to pull any plugs yet, but I feel bad every time I log in...
[deleted]
It's wasted anyways.
It speaks volumes about the community. I think it is amazing.
It‚Äôs just a game. Feeling like you wasted your time and/or money? No, you get to keep the memories of fun times and move on to other games that deserve your hard earned cash.
You know there's some good in you if you had too much time invested in WoW and still went through deleting everything because freedoms more important.

I know I scrubbed Overwatch off my Xbox. I don't own a PC anymore but I'ma delete my battle account through my phone real soon though.
Also same.
Stomping on free speech and supporting human-rights violations and they've "already paid for it"? Guess that stuff is cheaper than I thought.
That‚Äôs completely not the issue. When a Chinese company does Chinese things in their country, that‚Äôs on China. It‚Äôs a shitty country to live in, from an American perspective. They don‚Äôt like how we do things and we don‚Äôt like how they do things. But as participants in the global community, we make agreements for trade between different countries (states). 

However, in this case, we had an American company participate in un-American use of power to set an example against freedom of speech when a different country with huge market leverage flexed their muscles. The American company (Blizzard) aided and abetted the foreign repression of free speech and attempted to silence a call for human rights. 

That‚Äôs the issue.
The employees won't be hurt by this. Blizzard Activision fired 800 employees on a record year for profits. They won't have less work because of this bashlack.
Lol if you honestly think what Blizzard did was just a "stupid mistake". There was no mistake about it.

And using your logic, I dont want the Apple employees who value human rights to be hurt...so I wont stop buying Apple shit.

No idea what the point of your post is.
The Apple factories are the best employment opportunities in the area by a mile. The workers would be the ones most fucked if those factories for whatever reason went out of business.

Basically, you want to further opress those being oppressed.
That wasn't an apology, that was a shoddy attempt at damage control.
I agree with you. Blitzchung even said what he did was wrong. My only problem is with the casters.
They did not apologize. They said that blitzchung getting 6 months is more appropriate implying that the full year is still suitable but 6 months is just MORE appropriate
I'm a little scared for you if you don't understand the difference between paying taxes to the government of the country you live in and giving money to an entirely optional video game company.
If you delete your account you forfeit the games on that account. If you have the physical CD you might be able to play it still, but digital purchases are gone.
At some point there is going to be a court ruling that changes that and it will have retroactive consequences.

As Gen-X and millennials age they will be taking control of governments and the fact that tech companies think that they can sell you a product then revoke your right to use it at any time essentially at their discretion is not something that will be tolerated forever.
> OP's mom had 7.7 Billion monthly active users. 

&#x200B;

Armchair calculations say... three different guys(?) a second. Seems a little on the low side for a "your mom" joke, but we'll take it.
No it doesn‚Äôt. I pay a wow sub to play wow.
Paying them money for playing a game you like doesn‚Äôt automatically means that you are supporting any business decisions they do. Same as buying stuff made in China doesn‚Äôt mean you support their political regime now, does it?
they banede me for saysiyngh frick
Naming your character after a political figure will get you a forced namechange. Doing it repeatedly will get you banned. It's in the EULA.
> He was not allowed to express any political belief at this event.

That was not in the rules.
Yeah, Hong Kong is just as bad as China guys.  ^^/s
> it's more hilarious that people are claiming that they "did their part" while doing nothing at all.

Its absolute cringe, its nothing but a sham for fake internet points.
>keep their gaming community safe from politics and such stuff.

Have you seen Barrens chat or trade chat in wow? Its nothing but politics.
I'm not sure you're using the word "safe" correctly lol
It was revoked because you expressed political views. We'll give it back if Reddit gets angry enough at us though.
Both. People will take them as keepsakes or to activate later more often than you'd think. 

But it doesn't happen all that often either.

Also depends on the store. Sometimes those card stands stay untouched by anyone for weeks and collect dust.

When overwatch launched, there were people who went and grabbed the PS4 cards from the kiosk because they wanted them as keepsakes but they were playing on PC and PC was digital goods.
1. The staff who has to inventory the card
2. The average customer who wants to buy wow time

Just because OP doesn't like Blizzard, he's gonna sabotage other players from playing Blizzard games? What a hero!
As a customer, I find that cards on the wrong peg happens all the time regardless of any political intention. Many customers just don't bother putting an item back on the right spot.
Then we don't choose Blizzard.
It's a little more complicated than that. To go from small wallet to big budget you need capital. The conventional way of that is outside capital. So you bit by bit give up control. Stock market, external pressure and they go to mergers and end where they are now slowly rotting away the original vision.
Of course it will! 
https://youtu.be/GPnTv0_WoEk
So get a refund and quit bitching

Surely your refund alone will bankrupt blizzard
they do own reddit so technically yes.
That's definitely the PR response, I guess it's up to you weather or not to believe it. What is certain is that similar violations have not received anywhere near as harsh a penalty as this particular topic...we each have to draw our own conclusion on that front.
They literally made a statement to China about how angered they were by the situation and how they would uphold the pride and dignity of the country. Of course they're sucking China's big Willy.
> They were just trying to keep politics out no?

if that's all they wanted to do then a 1/3 strike probation kind of thing would've been fine. 

but they fired 2 casters and took the guy's prize money, and banned him for like a year.

their PR response 5 days later or whatever was continuing to pretend what they did was right with no apology.

and as other posts here have shown, they are happy to mix politics all up in there in the USA (e.g. LGBTQ) but not in China (e.g. LGBTQ).
How is it nothing like that?
That's not the same argument being made.

The post was insinuating that losing part of that region would bankrupt the company. It wouldn't. Not even close.

Losing the revenue would hurt, sure - but not force them into bankruptcy.
I'm not missing the point. No value and free/take me are two different things. 

The cards have no value until they are taken to the register for theft reasons. It's to deter people from stealing.
I think you're missing the point, the card as a whole has no value as-is but there  are manufacturing costs involved...the ink to print the images...the materials themselves like cardboard...none of that is free. It might have no value to the consumer, until activated, but someone somewhere paid money to have it made and shipped...even if it was a minuscule sum. Theft is theft regardless of value or worth.
Thanks man for the kind words
Talking about yourself huh? It's good to be self aware I guess.
Yeah cause uninstalling a Blizzard game leads to saving Chinese people from getting their rights re-instated and not having their arms broken at the elbow.  
But keep buying PC parts and stuff that are manufactured in China by some of the corporations that support the people leading the killings.
I'm sure china LOVES all the nice little water coolers and awesome graphics cards you buy that include parts made in their wonderful factories :)
Where‚Äôs the lie? The developers even staged walk outs at the corporate office, but you want to insinuate that the entire company needs to be punished?
You deleted your shit? Then again, WoW is rather dead at this point (imo). Its just a matter of time when classic runs out of content or nostalgic value.
Lol do you want to list some of the games are going to go play so I can go ahead and Link you how they have ties to communist China or would you ignore that and just keep your selective outrage focused on blizzard? What about the food you eat or the clothes you wear are the phone you use for the computer you use as a car you drive you don't think any of those businesses do business with communist China? well I guess it doesn't matter because it's called selective outrage for a reason and you can just select what you're outraged at so never mind proceed with the hypocrisy.
I can't see how an apology will ever be enough. An apology is easy to make and literally means nothing, it's just words. Sure an apology between two individuals is one thing, but a big corporation, nah man.

Blizzard better show me with actions that they're "sorry". They need to step up truly and live by their own words; "Every voice matters".
I'm more worried about the fact if I keep my account open with them, in the future what further information will they want from me and end up passing directly or indirectly to an authoritarian government? They've already declined my requests for data and account deletion three times and I just put in my fourth and final before I start contacting government officials and media. Blizzard has obliterated any and all goodwill they built up with me, and I've been a fan of their properties since I was a kid playing The Lost Vikings on SNES. Like you said, they've played their cards and the direction Bobby Kotick and crew wish to take Activision Blizzard isn't a direction I support.
I know how they could come back and restore their image in my eyes. If theyd release a Diablo4 without any ingame purchases. Like none. No greedy bs. Just a good, polished, blizzard north quality game with a fair price. Simple as that. That would go a looong way. Giving me some faith back.

Someone commented having over 10k hours in wow and having played most other blizz titles too and im also in the thousands range for D3 for sure. I think even if Blizzard never comes back from this, i wouldnt delete my account. Too much work went into this. Its totaly fine just not touching the games. There is no harm in keeping this stuff until Blizz goes titts up and maybe releases an offline version for D3.
I've been trying to play games like SC2, and HOTS, but every time i have been, I feel dirty, especially when i look at the Brood War skin i wanted, and now can't have because I was going to buy it the day the news broke about the injustice. I am both PISSED and disgusted because not only are they supporting a polical entity that refuses to accept freedom, they are also providing me with a giant WALL in the way of something i would have broke down and wasted money on. The people responsible should be thrown on the street and left in a gutter.
> Starcraft 64

Wait what? I thought everyone hated that version of the game.
I would highly recommend that people who think along the lines of "I've already put so much work/time/money into _____" read up on the concept of [Escalation of Cost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment) (often related to the Sunk Cost Fallacy).

Essentially, just because you invested in the past, doesn't mean that you've actually wasted that investment by choosing to no longer sink more into it.

EDIT: Typo, thanks phone. (Sink Cost Fallacy -> Sunk Cost Fallacy)
That's why I ended up deleting and switching to a bunch of other games to see what clicks.  If I'm not going to support Blizzard financially then I'm not going to undo that moral stance by populating their servers and, essentially, help make their games playable.  I was Server First to 85 and have other unique, irreplaceable achievements (I'm sure many of us do), so I haven't been strong enough to delete the account, but I deleted it off my computer so it would take an extra amount of weakness and lying to myself to get it going again.

I also couldn't stomach pretending to be a hero online while boosting the server population numbers of a company actively trying to suppress a guy who spoke up for real life heroes.  It was nauseating and really changed the way I looked at myself.
Get out of that computer chair and your balls might finally drop, and instead of feeling sad you will feel glad leaving blizzard in the dust.
Blizzard wants that china money more than they care about human decency. They did not even reverse the ban. Just 1/2 it. If this was there worst moment, why didn't they actually apologize? Because that would get in the way of that sweet sweet chinese money. Is a video game worth your damn soul?
lol, blizzard isn't a people, it's a company. I throw money at them when they do nice things, I burn their shit to the ground when they back organ-harvesting freedom-oppressing tyrants. if you don't, then they keep propping up things like organ harvesting and freedom oppressing, *because it's not a goddamn person with a conscience with whom I have any manner of social contract*.
I would say it‚Äôs the complete opposite of stupid to escape a time consuming MMO made by a company that only cares about profits.  Even in a normal situation, the amount of work in a MMO has no payoff, there‚Äôs no skills acquired to help you better your lot in life.  I‚Äôd suggest it to anyone that‚Äôs put so much progress in a game that they feel they can‚Äôt quit, even if the company that makes it is proving themselves to be evil.
Companies should be involved in politics, they always are. Silence is a decision. 

You sound like a coward and an apologist. 

Sit on the sideline and oaky the games you love. Make no personal sacrifice. The world goes on despite people like you. 

Apathy is a cancer.
Time spent happy is never wasted.
Yea nah, id much rather have something to show for than just having the time effort and money go up in flames.
They did apologise to China.
That‚Äôs why I said technically
Everyone demands an apology then when they get one they won't accept it. What kind of apology we're people seriously expecting to get from a major corporation?
The casters who encouraged Blitzhchung to hijack the tournament stream, instead of trying to keep the discussion on topic? Why would you want someone like that casting another esports tournament?
[deleted]
Exactly my deal. I "boycotted" wow for 10 years before this shit happened and I only started playing again for classic. I'm not the one who funded them to this point and I'm not going to quit now. Everyone who canceled their subs will be buying Chinese products in the future no matter how hard they try not to.
I wonder if any of these nerds ever took a look at their clothing tags.  XD
It doesn't mean your supporting it. But your definately financing it. Which in my definition is supporting it. Kinda like when advertiser's pull out when they find someone has done something bad they are partnering with. Now company's do this just to save face. But as a person I believe in the same concept but for more humanistic reasons.

Obviously no, i wholly support hong kong. But that is still a political bias. If blitzchung is allowed to do express his beliefs then suddenly blizzard has to let everyone, and its only so long before someone is expressing hateful beliefs you dont agree with
A mild inconvenience is not hurting someone. What a grossly entitled statement. The employee still gets paid, the customer still gets their card. Heaven forbid you do something that takes more than 3 seconds.
[deleted]
Yep and throw out any other chinese products you own while you are at it.
Seems pretty simple to me.  They sold out. That was their decision.  Doesnt matter to whom it was.  The end result is the same.
Rn I'm honestly too high to give a shit, so. . .
How so?
There hasnt been any other situation in GRANDMASTERS.

The American University situation, is because they arwnt under the same contract that Blitzchung was under. 

I dont watch GM but I have heard of people being punished for doing much less so I‚Äôll assume Blizzard doesnt like rule breaking very much. 

The punishment was harsh and considering the whole situation happened outside the USA, I am sure the overexaggeration was a poor attempt to be diplomatic.
Unpopular opinion....REEEEEEEE
that was people working for netease which is chinese company on china  

guesss what the people working there are chinesse !
No they didn't.
Yeah Blizzard dropped a PR ball the size of a city
What about LGBT? So they have a gay character in a game... That means it has to be in political support of LGBT? Sorry but that's just silly.
They already backed off, reduced the ban to 6 months and said he will keep his prize money.
Okay, it's like that but in a waaaay bigger scale with different options. Soo a little bit like that.
That‚Äôs true. But people like to exaggerate.
Exactly. No value. You just proved me right. So if I take it and it has no value at all, what is the criminal charge? Stealing. Ok. What is the value of what I stole if it says it has no value printed right on it.
I am missing the point? I am asking on a law perspective. Not how much the cards cost to make. Not the materials. So thanks. But no. I want an answer from someone who knows something about the law.
Just giving you some hope for the future is all XD
In a sense, yes.  As it fades, you learn what's important to you, and what's not.  The most important thing for myself being that I do the best I can to leave the world slightly better at the end of the day.  Whether that's holding a door for someone, helping the old lady next door with her groceries, or leaving little tidbits of knowledge on the internet.

You seem like a smart kid but I think you're "wasting your time" on a lot of the posts you make.  It's your time to waste, don't get me wrong, but I think you could do so much more if you were to determine what you feel is important to you and refocus your efforts on those things (instead of the unintelligible bullshit so commonly found on the internet.)

Also, self-awareness is heavily undervalued.
so do nothing, is better.
yeah, I mean, 10 years of vanilla private server growth definitely proves that people get bored
Whataboutism  aint helping anyone m8.
Something is better than nothing, even if you wish it was more.

This is more about a message. Even shutting blizzard down entirely wouldn't do a whole lot besides shut down blizzard. But if they go down or take a significant hit, other companies might be less likely to follow suit. Even if they're unphased, at least people can see that they aren't alone, because it's hard to try if you think nobody else cares and it's you against the world.
That's what I mean by "apology AND correction of direction." There's no reason to be against each other here.
In this case it would mean something because China is watching. Blizzard put out that bootlicking post on Chinese social media because they knew that. If they publicly say they were wrong to silence support for HK then they're putting themselves at risk of being banned from the country. That's what I want to see.
This is how I felt after their "apology". I won't delete anything, but they wont be getting any more money from me until I feel they represent the company I grew up with again and that likely wont happen, so it is what it is. The only blizzard getting my attention going forward is at the local Dairy Queen.
Don't hold your breath.
They gotta give us a ‚Äúfree Hong Kong‚Äù emote for free in games that support emotes such as overwatch before I forgive
Inb4 Diablo 4 + all dlcs free at Blizzcon
This whole situation would not be relevant to Blizzard if not for ‚Äújust words.‚Äù
It was my first blizzard game, lets be honest, it sucks, and I didn't play the campaign way back then when I started playing it. I booted up the ol' N64 a few years ago to try it again, and rose tinted glasses were brutally shattered, the game *sucks*, the N64 controls ***suck***. But it was still worth bringing up, as I have had a lot of fun on it in the past, and i'll always have those memories! If this whole situation wasn't happening, maybe i'd try Starcraft Remastered, or Starcraft 2

EDIT: Also a fun thing to mention, when I tried it again a few years back, I gave it a serious try; I looked up the control mappings, and I went ham. I could not beat the zerg campaign, I tried so many times, and the sweat of my hands made the controller joystick so frustrating to work with. Man now i'm looking at that with a bit of nostalgia, funny how that works
I've typed and deleted this reply so many times now, trying to figure out how to even respond. I don't know. I am refusing to myself that this is a sunk cost situation, because I ditch projects that i've poured tons of hours into all the time. But maybe it is, maybe it's only different because of the *amount* of time, my entire remembered life has been spent on this game. Quitting isn't easy, even if I have a good reason to. I know that sounds like addiction, and if this was just a few months ago i'd agree, but lately i've managed to tone this down to a proper hobby and I haven't logged in every single day, but maybe i'm just throwing excuses.

BFA would be the perfect time for me to finally leave after all these years, but now there's Classic. I've been waiting for this for so long, I don't want to miss it. I know it's still a long time away, but after Kel'thuzad, I need to seriously re-evaluate my life
[deleted]
People out here thinking giving up a video game is a life changing sacrifice  XD
I can only speak for myself but not all the time spent in wow was spent happy in hindsight.
Sunken cost fallacy eh? It was bound that some fanboys wouldn‚Äôt be able to cut their addiction.
As someone who has been actively engaged in several esports events, I can tell you that 6 month bans is a career ender for most people. Even 2 - 3 months is enough shade to kill a commentators career. I personally don't think Blitzchung will re-enter the Heartstone scene, it's going to be  a very difficult road ahead for him. $10,000 is small recompense for the long term loss he has ahead of him.

Thanks for your comment though. You are right to acknowledge *some* form of action/communication from Blizzard, even if it technically was akin to an oily fish wriggling out of an uncomfortable situation. Playing the middle ground isn't going to appease the fans.

My take on it is this - they would have done well to reverse the bans for all three people, Blitz+casters, and refund the prize money with a hefty, and I mean *hefty*, warning for any future incidents being met with the 12 month ban hammer. It would be enough to say "we're sorry" but also say " we really take events seriously and do not want to turn esports into a political forum"
One that actually apologizes and doesn‚Äôt attempt to hide, obfuscate, or otherwise ignore the other major key points of the whole situation. 

What Blizz put out wasn‚Äôt an apology.
I didnt know that. I don‚Äôt speak Chinese.
Until you realize PC's don't come with optical drives anymore.   


Plus the CD keys are probably invalid now.
While this very much applies to someone who's main concern is clothing and spends a lot of money there. I get the bare necessities when it comes to clothes. And I unfortumatley have to be picky about the price. 

You are right though with the use of online tools like Amazon it's much easier to purchase and research better options for those with the resources to do so. I hope I do I make the correct decision
I support Blizzard with my money to create more games I like to play. What they do with the rest is not my concern. When you pay taxes do you support your government spending it for unnecessary wars?
None of this bans expressing political beliefs. Thanks for confirming.

ETA: And these aren't even the Hearthstone rules. What does Overwatch tournament rules have to do with any of this?
They're currently supporting beliefs we don't agree with.
Yet they can push social justice in their games at times? That is not political bias? Rolls eyes.
In that case, OP has done nothing at all besides karma whore. I hate what China has done to HK as much as the next guy, but this is just pathetic
Screwing over the staff in the shop or wow players isn't "doing something good", it's called picking an easy target
"whatabout-ism" in full effect here üòÇ

Yeah I know other companies support China and its nearly impossible to avoid it.

But I don't like how Blizzard is conducting business. So I will not support them. Easy as that :)
Calm down Mr iPhone user. We know you can't live without your Chinese made products.
Yep well it's been terminal for a long time. Well before this latest PR disaster.
Wow bro ur so cool
They have a 5% stake in reddit, or something close to that number.
Unpopular? Maybe. Stupid? Very much so.
They still speak for Blizzard.
Yes they did, I guess you live under a rock.
What about LGBT?

Blizzard says "our official broadcasts remain focused on the game and are not a platform for divisive social or political view".

https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dgodfz/we_wont_allow_any_talk_of_social_justice_or/

apparently, not in china.

That's a start. They still haven't unfired the casters. And 6-month ban is still overkill for a first strike offense.

The casters are still fired and he was still punished for supporting human rights.
They haven't backed off, they want people to think they did, but not a damn thing changed ethically
Making the card costs money. So it does have a value
On a law perspective, the cards have value to the supplier. Even if they didn't, value is irrelevant so taking them without compensation constitutes theft either way. I don't really see how this is hard to understand. 

TL:DR Just don't steal shit and you won't have to worry about it.
Yea, if it was one continuous server i might believe that. But it wasnt.
Pointing out we are all Hypocrites and want to keep our heads in the sand is not helping m8.

FIFY
Sure and I bet you also wipe your ass before you poop?
My bad for missing the "and" in your comment.
I fully understand where you're coming from, and it's one of the reasons why I think it's important to understand the concept(s) I mentioned in the above comment. While I support the boycott (for me, it was ditching HS), I really just added that comment because it's easy to lose perspective with something like an MMO.

At the end of the day, WoW is just a game with the social aspect of an MMO culture. Fundamentally, that means that you should be able to stop and start whenever you want without it truly harming your day to day life. It sounds like you've maybe had some issues with that in the past, but are working your way out of it - Personally I dealt with that a bit with Final Fantasy XI, so all I can say is good job and do what's best for you.
cares about profits vs *only* cares about profits. both survive, but the latter doesn't even blink when some of those profits have a little mass murder and systemic oppression sprinkled on them.
Doesn't have to be life changing to be hard, but of you can't give up a game for your morals. What could you ever give up? No one is asking people to be a saint.
you are comparing apples and oranges.
Frankly I'd say even pay the casters for lost wages, and make a point to get them a new job as casters elsewhere.
Just wondering, they can't just make another account and play?
You Sir are getting a upvote for properly using the the word obfuscate! Such a great word.
Nobody should have expected any more of an apology than what we got. Everyone is upset about Blitz losing his prize money and being banned for a year, as well as the announcers, and Blizz game him his prize moeny back and cut his ban in half. That's the best possible scenario we could have realistically expected.
Ya I usually try to hide my face when I'm following the rules.  Totally normal...
Cheapest external USB DVD drives are like $20.

CD keys would still work for offline play, when installing a game the key is only checked against an algorithm in the installer program which makes sure the key has been created with that same algorithm and is not just some random keystrokes.

In online play the key is again authenticated when the game calls home through Internet.
The keys aren't invalid, that's a load of crap. You can type the key from your case into your Bnet account and add the game to your digital collection or install it straight from the CD.
If money is the issue buy all your clothes second hand.  No money makes it overseas.  End of problem.
If you read the highlighted portions there‚Äôs a lot of stuff that‚Äôs determined by Tournament Administration.  

There‚Äôs also the fact that Blizzards response says they wants their events to be focused on the games themselves.  

I image that Hearthstone would have similar rules about player conduct. All it would take is a 10 second google search for you to find out.
It is not just beliefs though, its also about fairness and equal opportunity.
Isn't that the point of Reddit? Also it made me laugh so there's that too.
Hey there.  I worked in two tech stores for about 12 years between the two. (Circuit City and a mom and pop). The vendors that stocked the card racks only did so when they were low and they did so many of those card stands, that all it took was about 30 seconds. They would immediately notice if cards were switched around because most of them are plan-o-grammed the same. So you are really making a mountain from a mole hill as this would take mere moments to fix and the vendor would likely not even care.
[deleted]
Slacktivism in full effect here.  Again, I'm sure blizz is the only company you support that has or is conducting bad business.  But you just need to wait for reddit to tell you to be enraged.
I use my pc.  That I built.
Exactly.  The tactics in the online store.  The continued disregard for their core playerbase on all franchises they run basically.  The big wigs of blizz aren't running for the hills for fun.
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Oh, so they don't own reddit, just 1/20th of reddit.  Looks like the actual majority owner is Advance Publications, a privately held company.
Go ahead and link it buddy. It sounds like you read something and made up your own alternative meaning to it.
Yeah because if they want to sell their product there they have to? They the same thing with wow and even the wow movie.



I'm not sure what your point is though? There are similar (changes to games) things done in many countries. China just happens to a bit more than most and a good sized market. Does having a gay character mean they are being political?
It‚Äôs on the contract he signed so it is nothing out of the rules.
Your comment was good at explaining it. Up until the disrespectful tort at the end.

Welcome to reddit.
I'm not sure what you're getting at. I think what I said makes more sense.
Thanks man, this sort of stuff can be difficult to talk about sometimes, especially with how people can be on Reddit. WoW won't last forever, it sure has lasted longer than most people thought it would, i'll be ready when the train finally hits its last destination
I mean,  theoretically he could but there would be no reason to. He makes money from the competitions which he is now unable to participate in.
You need to realistically reevaluate your expectations and integrity then my man.
everyone \[articles, reddit\] said they were trying to hide or something. idk
That may have worked before [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher was a thing, but as soon as you go to patch your game / make an account on [battle.net](https://battle.net) it's going to pop as used CD KEY as all blizzard games require use through battle net.   


You may be able to get away with warcraft 3 / D2 / SC2 in the original format, but no online play. 

My suggestion would be to find a WOW private server and play for free if you like it that much .
Can you transfer the keys or reuse keys previously used?

WTF was the downvote for?
Your right thank you. I'll keep that in mind
But if the clothes are made in China and you buy them second hand, you are supporting person who is supporting China.
And it would take you a 10 second google search to find out that the Hearthstone rules (like the Overwatch rules you've posted) do not ban  political speech. 

It does penalize any speech that Blizzard deems offensive or they believe will cost them money - ***at their discretion***. That's why people are upset. Significantly fewer people would be upset if there was a blanket ban on all political speech.
My concern is that Blizzard's actions have silence someone's speech - seemingly in preference to another set of ideas, which is Hong Kong's protest I'd an insurgency and is unjust.

If Blizzard had just said that "opinions stated during the stream are not necessarily those of Blizzard" everything would have been fine. Instead they are giving Chinese nationalists the power to silence a non-citizen outside of their country. In what world does that make sense?
Fine. Does this not prevent a wow player from finding his game time in the shop?
Right. And it still prevents a wow gamer from buying the game time
Slacktivism is just essentially mentally supporting something. It's not slacktivism to boycott something. That's an actual financial incentive for a company to change. You can argue it's ineffective, but boycotting is taking a tangible stand.

From parts that were made in good old China
What does that have to do with you owning an iPhone?
Ya no shareholder that started with 5% ever ended up with majority control,  just doesnt happen.   /s
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfi5rh/blizzards_official_response_we_highly_object_the/
It shows that Blizzard doesn't care about LGBT people because they don't wanna stick to their guns and would rather scrub them from a game so they can profit from China, instead of keeping them in and not taking money from an autocratic regime that pisses on human rights.
The reality of it is that every single decision Blizz makes is going to be in the name of money. It's unfortunate but that's the way big businesses work. This apology is a calculated move to not piss off the chinese market while trying to save face and reduce the damage done in the west. Blizz has no tegridy and I'm not going to fool myself into hoping they found it because everyone on reddit is mad at them.
They told him in mandarin. "SAY THE EIGHT WORDS"   They egged him on.   They knew it was against the terms of the contract they signed as employees.  I dont know where everyone in this thread is from but here, you can be fired for no reason whatsoever.  So actually violating a contract would easily get you canned.  But yes this only happens in china.  Yes china sucks ass.  But people need to actually use their heads.  China has been a shithole for years and we have been buying their products almost since the dawn of this nation.  Stop waiting for reddit to tell.you to be mad and think for yourself.
Yes. As long as there aren't 2 computers using the same key at the same time.
I'm not trying at all to defend what blizz has been doing lately and not even the recent debacle. They have been milking us for years and shit on us any chance they get for money.  No need to wait for reddit or any other site to tell you to be outraged.  We should have been voting with our dollars long before this.
That's not how that works.  When you buy from goodwill ect the money doesnt go to the person you knob.
Has there EVER been ANY other political speech at a Blizzard event? Either BlizCon, an eSports thing, any official stream of any kind. Has anyone else ever spoken about their own personal beliefs while broadcasting at or through something Blizzard official?
If your issue is silencing them then it should be about hong kong as a whole right now.
I agree.
All the cards are logged into the POS inventory system. If we couldn't find it on the rack we can check the computer and see how many we are supposed to have.  Finding errant cards is no big deal. The real pain in the ass was morons who would steal the cards not realizing they were unuseable.
Mentally supporting something does dick except make you feel better about yourself.  I stopped buying blizz products because I didnt like their tactics over the past couple of years.  The exclusive mounts that somehow ended up on the store after six months. I know it sucks but the ToS that blitzchung agreed to.  He chose to violate them.  As did the casters. End of story.  My point is I made that choice to leave myself.  I didnt wait for a social media outlets outrage to tell me that the blizz that we know died a long time ago and doesnt give a rat's ass about it's OG Fanbase.  Not to make a joke but try to be "Ahead of the curve"
Do you really want me to post my specs?  I will but I guaranfuckingtee.  None of it is chinese.  Like I said I do my research before Twitter or reddit tells me to.  Also samsung even tho I dont own their products have a manufacturer in Austin Texas.  You always have options if you look.
Nope.
I dont own one.  So I guess that's the joke?
Apple removed a map from their app store after pressure from the ccp because it was being used by protestors in HK.
Holy non-sequiter, Batman. 

We're talking about present day, not a hypothetical future. Move along.
So.. did you look at that thread? Because that comment wasn't made by Blizzard.
So basically what you're saying is  "nothing blizzard does now will be good enough."
what are you talking about dude. A: then good, glad they got fired. B: ive been those most "support blizzard in this decision" on reddit.
So you can register the same key on multiple accounts as long as only one is logged in at a time?
What do you mean blizzard milks for money? Overwatch has no season passes. Wow is the same way it‚Äôs been since it launched in terms of expansions etc. Starcraft 2 had one expansion, everything else free. Diablo 3 is the same way. And hots is just a generic moba. The only ‚Äúmilking‚Äù you get is through destiny or call of duty
I know, I was just pointing out that this idea of suporting somebody‚Äôs side actions when buying main product is stupid.
Not sure how that is relevant. You're welcome to watch all previous Blizzard streams to find out.
Big man here did it first!
[deleted]
Manufactured in TX from imported parts.  No different.
You do realize just because a product is assembled in the US doesn't mean the components come from the US, right?
Sure, You do have companies that are slowly moving to lower wage countries like Vietnam or Indonesia. But still the majority of computer parts are made in China, even if you think you have a product that isn't made there, it still might use outsourcing to manufacture some parts of it in a Chinese factory. Can you really tell me honestly that you know the origin of EVERY single piece that your computer has? Because I sure as hell can not, just because something says MADE IN X COUNTRY on the box, it rarely tells you anything but where it was assembled.
Ya thinking about the future and contemplating what could happen is for idiots just live in the present you are right.
It's a part of Blizzard. They represent the company for the Chinese market and everything they do is endorsed by Blizzard or else it wouldn't be done. 

It must suck to be so ignorant and willing to defend Blizzard.
Nothing they ever realistically could have done would have been good enough
I didnt mean this as a direct attack, I meant reddit as a whole.  Sorry I am replying to a lot of threads and got a little discombobulated.
...No, that would be stupid. That's like expecting to get your whole family into the theatre with 1 movie ticket, you can sell or transfer the ticket but you can only use it for it's value of 1 license.
You have no idea what you are talking about.  Literary almost everything in this paragraph is incorrect.  Starcraft expansions didnt go free to play until way after they were released.  Originally we paid for each one.  Overwatch has loot crates which people hate across the board in most video games nowadays.  Wow is 15 dollars a month and has a mount/pet store where they tell you things are exclusive yet months down the road are made available to everyone. Diablo 3 also you are incorrect there... Do I need to go on?
How can you not see that‚Äôs its relevant?  

If this is the first time then it sucks they all got banned, but it‚Äôs well within Blizzards authority to do so.  

If it HAS happened before then either Blizzard did the same thing and no one cared about it, or Blizzard did nothing.  

So tell again me how it‚Äôs not relevant.
That wasn't really the point.  It's not about being first or right.  It is about everyone being more tuned in to what is going on in our world and not just our country and not just paying attention to social media trends.  But thanks for joining the conversation.  Even if you didnt really add anything useful.
Enhance
If you look up I dont even own a samsung.  So this isn't even relevant.
Damn I the thought never crossed my mind.  Same prob goes for many things....  Yes of course It crossed my mind you doughnut.  I research my parts and components.  The same way I do musical instruments or cars that I buy.  More big brain shit from the peanut gallery.
That's fine. Not what this comment chain is about. You can start a new one. Hell, a whole new post, if you want. Be the change.
Its not a part of Blizzard at all. Its a totally different company.



>It must suck to be so ignorant and willing to defend Blizzard.



Says the guy who just made a completely false claim.
So....."we're mad and we're just gonna stay mad forever."
I am not stupid. I am just not sure how people are claiming that deleting your account won‚Äôt result in losing licenses even if you still have the previously used CD keys.

It is clear having the CD keys is not going to help you get your licenses back if you return to the game after deleting your account.

I AM JUST ASKING QUESTIONS TO MAKE PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE IT!

So much stupid on this thread but I am not the one doing it.
Please. I never said heart of the swarm was free to play. I said it was one time paid for expansion. Same with diablo 3 and reaper of souls. Overwatch doesn‚Äôt have season pass. The loot boxes you can unlock without paying a single dime extremely easily. Wow has a sub because that game is being worked on 24/7 365 because it‚Äôs an MMO. Like other premium mmos. 

So yes. Please go on? I would like to hear more of your biased opinion because you hopped on a band wagon.
>How can you not see that‚Äôs its relevant?

Because it's not. It not appearing in streams is not the same as it being banned and a punishable offense.

>If this is the first time then it sucks they all got banned, but it‚Äôs well within Blizzards authority to do so.

Who is arguing that Blizzard was not allowed to do it?

>If it HAS happened before then either Blizzard did the same thing and no one cared about it, or Blizzard did nothing.

Cutting the stream is not what happened here. Pay attention.

>So tell again me how it‚Äôs not relevant.

Because it's not. It not appearing in streams is not the same as it being banned and a punishable offense.
Don't care about people being politically savvy, you just care about being right and looking smart.
[deleted]
If it isn't relevant why did you use it as an example?
Tf do you even mean by you "research" your components? You track down where each gram of copper in every trace came from? You're comments make absolutely no sense. Explains a lot.
You're right sorry to intrude on the thread about moving a prepaid card.  Keep at it.
As I said, they represent the company. But whatever makes you feel better about supporting Blizzard.
I mean people can think however they want, I'm just callin em as i see em
Well, games like WoW that never had offline physical copies the answer is probably no. Once a key from a wow game is used it is attached to that account, if the account is deleted then the key is gone. What the OP was talking about 

>Hah, I knew holding onto these CD copies all these years would pay off.

is games like WC3 or the original SC that had physical media with keys that unlocked the content on the CD, those games will always be playable offline with the original key, any game that is solely run through the BNET launcher is not subject to those conditions, which is why holding on to the CD copies would pay off. I still have my WC3 set and can install it straight to my computer. 

And I never said you were stupid, I said the proposition would be stupid because then Blizzard would lose a shit load of money if everyone could just share their keys with their friends.

So the answer is yes and no, you WILL lose more current licenses but you wouldn't lose older ones.
I hopped on a bandwagon?  Jesus.  What is it you think you internet warriors are doing?
Obviously some people understood my point and you didn‚Äôt. So I hope someone else can simplify it enough so you can understand what the adults are talking about.
That's pretty much what you said in your last comment without the sarcasm.  Ya I got it.  You still have nothing to add to the conversation.  When you do feel free to post it.
Only if you have the proper thermal paste and correct socket.
I'm simply trying to say if I was a Samsung user.  A quick Google search showed me the Austin facilty. If I used their products and wanted to be responsible I would start there.  If I found out it was chinese imports branded as made in the USA I would move on.  Same with any company.  That's why I used the example.
Nah, that's the post. This thread is about the ownership of reddit.
No, they don't represent Blizzard. Are you crazy or just desperate to be on the bandwagon?
Idk what that is
Lol, ok kid.
I'll feel free to post anything I want to at any point. 

Nice misdirection! Big man does it again!
Fair enough.
Being pedantic must be your hobbie.  Have a great day.
The only desperate band wagon jumper is you. If I act like a fool in my work clothes outside of work my job will fire me. Hell they might fire me if they realize it‚Äôs me even if I‚Äôm not. A BRANCH of blizzard IS STILL BLIZZARD!
"I'll feel free to post anything I want at any point.  Nice Misdirection! Big man does it again!"  Nice projection.  Sounds like a Trump tweet.  XD

#BIGBRAIN
Thanks, I needed this comment for my bingo card.
Damn you're so salty about this video. Rather sad and pathetic mate.
Its not even a branch of blizzard. Its a totally different company.
Lol nice
Must be exhilarating
I'm not salty about the video.  Im salty about people thinking this is big brain shit.  And people like you defending it without a rational conversation other than "hurr hurr you mad"  If you wanna add to the thread feel free, otherwise keep the low brow trolling  for your friends.
Enjoy being a sheep. Bye sheep.
Very succinct argument.
Except you absolutely are. The video was clearly meant in a humorous way. Sorry that you love Blizzard so much that you can't understand that. I haven't seen a single rational comment from you, yet mine was. I simply called you out for being a salty boi.
Enjoy being crazy and ignorant.


You're like Trump, can never admit when they're wrong.


Obviously you thought it was blizzard initially and now we've worked our way to a branch of blizzard which they still aren't.
True.
Yes I love blizzard so much I stopped using their products before the social media outrage.  You totally cracked the case here sherlock.  Your cognitive dissonance is so bad with you that you claim I love blizz while I have been trashing them in every post for the last 3 hours... saying that I saw this trash comming.
How does the CCP boot taste?
Let's shake hands
Trashing them in every post? You do realize your comments are visible on your profile right? Only thing you're attempting to trash is a ton of people in these replies who got the point of the video.
Ya I do and I have said time and time again.  I stopped buying their products a long time ago.  Just because I think people are idiots for their most likely temporary outrage doesnt mean I support blizzard.
Because you somehow know it's temporary.

 K bud.
"Most likely."  Did you not read that part or are you just an idiot?
Still applies 100%. Sorry salty boi. I know you're very angry and have a room temperature IQ but cheer up.
IM TAKING THINGS OUT OF CONTEXT BUT I'M STILL RIGHT CUZ I SAY SO.  REEEEEEEE - NoPenguins_InAlaska
Yup, you just confirmed it. Salty, salty boi. My thoughts and prayers are with you.
Damn this person called me salty twice.  How can I possibly recover.
By not being angry. EZ PZ bucko

I'm 99% positive that BlizzCon is going to have a "dress code" requiring people to not wear that.
Don't even support them by buying a ticket, protest by the entrances make it difficult for them
Don‚Äôt buy anything while you‚Äôre there either
I dont have tickets to BlizzCon but will be driving thw 4 hours to Aneheim to be a pro free speech asshole in the parking lot. Any place to organize?
\*black
Go. Make sure your voice is heard. And pop a pro Hong Kong t-shirt or cap in your pocket, and change in the toilet.

You bought the tickets long before this debacle, and asking for a refund just means they could sell it to someone who will support blizzard instead.

Don't be silent.
this is disrespectful to [red shirt guy](https://youtu.be/fFnGjyPYxjM) .
If we want to send a message, we have to target the sponsors.
NO!  People who are slated to go should protest just inside the gates.  Don't walk all the way in, just gum up the entrance.
I honestly think blizzcon will get canceled this year.
Everytime i post this i get so heavily downvoted i have to delete it. Glad you made it homie
Red or black. I've heard both.

This whole "movement" is going in different directions.
Red shirt guy was a prophet
ball is in blizzards court. if they choose to censor their own con that's the straw. I have only ever been a casual player of blizzard but I am making it a priority to help others understand the scope of the betrayal. 

they need to be ejected from Western markets if they want to align themselves with a government that commits active genocide
They can‚Äôt stop all of us
yes yes yes!
black shirts!! not red!!
Just pretend you're a fan of Red Shirt Guy if security ask any questions.
I know there's a lot of nerds tempted to buy merchandise but stop being addicted and support Hong Kong Protest... seriously.
I prefer Black shirt  
or with a helmet too!
Why use shirts with the colour of their government? Use black with a white Hong Kong symble, looks better imo and stays away from the colour of their shitty government.
Wrong attitude.

&#x200B;

It sohuld read:  
"Blizzcon is coming up and we should all cancel our ticket purchases"
I suspect they will almost definitely turn people away coming in like that citing a dress code violation or some other bullshit coverup. However shirts are well, layerable if you catch my very obvious drift.

Wear something black over it and when the livestream starts panning to the audience, a mass reveal could be pretty badass.....until they cut the feed seconds later of course.
If any information about *Diablo: Immortal* comes out at Blizzcon, particularly characters, they should immediately be made into symbols of freedom for Hong Kong to get the game banned in China.

This could kill the Chinese mobile revenue Blizzard so desperately wants.
I'd also like a call for their CEO to resign.
We should also sing "do you hear the people sing"
Black is the color of the Hong Kong protesters
Yes this. Also, vote with your wallet - if action is not taken by Blizzard to walk this back, reverse the narrative here, I'll never buy Blizzard again. Already submitted my request for account deletion.
Blizzard staff picks you to ask question. You: "Yeah, I'm pirating Diablo 4."
Yeesyeyeyysysyeysyyseyyeyeysysysususesyesssss
They will show some character and new lootboxes for their kid hero shooter, some p2w cards for their children's card game, some more anduin shit story for their elitist mmo, and D4 for people who think D3 was anything above mediocre and you all will shut up because your memory only knows what happened in the last 48 hours then it resets and you will continue to consume.

Also for blizz workers, don't know how much like an slave they treat you over there, but you work for an evil company, you are as guilty as the company, leave or be evil but don't get offended when you called evil.
What if every attendee is red shirt guy
Black shirt, take a backpack and put a gas mask and umbrella in it. Change in the bathroom. Make yourself seen.
They can‚Äôt ban us all raid Blizzard HQ
isnt it black shirts with masks? or red shirts so it can be seen more hmmm
Everyone who already bought tickets, protest inside.
Everyone who didn't but are still able to go to the area, protest outside.
  

**Want to make a big difference? Write to your congressman about Blizzard.**

Ask them to make the CEO of Activision Blizzard testify to congress.

Find your representative: [https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)

Here's a sample letter.

Dear Congressman,

I am a constituent. I write with concern regarding Chinese assault on American values and the use of American companies as a proxy for this behavior. As senator Rubio put it well - " China \[is\] using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally. "

A number of American companies, including Apple, the NBA, and Activision Blizzard, have recently taken action to appease China and in particular the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). A quick review of recent news provides all the detail that is necessary. In particular, Activision Blizzard censored and revoked prize money for a Hong Kong-based contestant for making a political message during an interview. No doubt this is due to their increasing revenue share from China.

The CEO of Activision Blizzard (and other companies) should be compelled to testify before Congress and explain why they are placing revenue and profit over western values and our country. They should be forced to explain why they allow their products ‚Äì computer games consumed by millions of Americans and many young people ‚Äì to be used as a proxy to carry Chinese values, such as censorship, to the west.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
u cant say free hk. say free china insteadüòê
Wear masks just like the protestors common do one better!
The best way to have our voices heard is to rent a space nearby and have a convention for communists with tiny penises support groups.
We should refund the ticket
Umbrellas, bring all unbreellas and open them inside.
Free Wu Kong!
Or you could just... not go.
Why would this get censored?
Something tell me, nothing will happen.

We are talking about the same cowards who dont let people having certain sign inside venue of the event from blizzard (ex : pepe the frog meme)

I highly doubt people will be able to get in with free hong kong sign or anything related to that.

The best thing people could do is to shout something like Free hong kong during speech and the only thing Blizzard could do about it is to cut the stream, which will be a massive win and prove to the world what a bunch of shit tier coward Blizzard has become.
[removed]
The endgame should be finding a way to get *Diablo: Immortal* banned in China. Turn it into a protest symbol.

This would cripple the Chinese mobile market revenue they so desperately seek.
[removed]
Wear black please. Red is a pro-china colour.
simply don't go
Thank you for your support but i would say wearing black is better than red since red is most likely representing pro-china
Black and yellow, not red. Also please have Uygur related stuff.

Nevermind all of you go there, and every time they talk walk away.
there are plenty designs at tee public dot com. Just search hong kong and sortbby newest.
Or don‚Äôt buy a ticket, therefore not giving them any money.
Are virtual tickets for Blizzcon available in China? Because if they are, that would be an amazing performance!
No,make them bk
Black thats the colour that they use
If you own a ticket and they womt refund show up and be as obnoxious as you can, if you can get a refund but you have your plane tickets and hotel reservations well then why not take a vacation a d hang out there for a few days 

Just a thought
I didn't buy tickets this year because I was so disgusted last year, I wish I did now, I would wear one
BlizzCon is gonna be a shitshow of epic scale. I can't wait!!
no, sneak in/fake tickets, and wear a black t shirt on top because there will 100% be a dress code
seriously? you should refund your tickets.
How about instead of wearing red shirts why not just dont turn up? You're still lining their pockets so they wont care what colour you wear if you turn up
Have I always needed to submit an image of my ID to prove im the holder of the account? That just sounds hyper wrong, in every way.
or just boycott Blizzcon. The biggest impact we can have on Blizzard is by affecting its finances.
So...paying for a company we hate to show how much we hate them?
How bout that Bobby Kotick being involved with Jeff Epstein?
Or better yet, just don't show up.
just dont go
did blizzard enslave hong kong or something
We wear BLACK not red
Wrath of the Red Shirt III: Liberation
Sure as long as you don't buy a ticket and just stand outside.  Otherwise you accomplished nothing.
At cost stickers, plaster them at the con:::: https://www.redbubble.com/people/faunkyfaux/works/41654848-liberate-hong-kong-revolution-of-our-time-mei-fights-for-rights?asc=u
Red shirts to something that is anti China? LOL.
What's funny is Blizzard is probably going to make a killing off this Blizzcon with the virtual ticket because of the HK debacle.
Should we get them made in china?
Charge back guys. Call your bank or go in and dispute the charge.
No, they need to be black.
Man they're not going to be able to show blizzcon....woah
I'm really curious about how Blizzcon attendees will respond to this. 

Rooster Teeth faced some similar drama when right before RTX 2019 it was revealed their animation department were crunching hard to meet deadlines. The RT fan community seemed split between using RTX as a vehicle to protest the company's poor decisions vs those who thought it would be unfair to hijack the con from those who paid tickets to see it. RT addressed the problems before the show luckily so it had mostly blown over by the time RTX came along, but I wonder what proportion of Blizzcon attendees are engaged enough with it all to use it as a chance to protest/disrupt the show.
Better yet don't go
it's easier if you don't go, just saying
Liberate Blizzard! Revolution of our Industry!
Guys - don't plan your action of resistance in a public forum.  You're going to get screen sniped by corporate.  You have 3 weeks.
blizcon is coming up, and that bitch better be empty. They don't care if you protest in america, they are sucking china's teet and pivoting to mobile anyway.  


Just don't even buy tickets.
I am so down, but first i need to find a shirt or make my own.

**BLACK PLZ**

Hong Kong people are glad becoz you guys do that.

**BUT BLACK PLZ IF U WANT TO SUPPORT HONG KONG PROTESTORS.**
Or not attended, maybe. Just a thought.
If you arrive in a freeHK shirt and they don‚Äôt let you in, FORCE YOUR WAY IN they cannot stop all of you
A "Free Hong Kong" shirt will probably get you ejected there (I am going and I did check the T&Cs). Although I don't think they can really do anything if I just wear a shirt with the HK flag printed on it. It'll definitely deliver the message without that obnoxious "in your face" attitude that some people seem to bring to the table that probably did literally nothing to support Hong Kong this far. Smart support yeah, jumping on the bandwagon is a bit stupid imho.
Blizzard, you are the best! +1000. China, be strong. Blizzard too
How about just not going?

You're still supporting them if you go.

But I guess videogames at important, right?
Check out #BoycottBlizzcon on twitter for more information. We're gonna disrupt these fools. 

 [https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoycottBlizzcon?src=hashtag\_click](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoycottBlizzcon?src=hashtag_click)
 What is wrong with people?? This action by Blizzard does not say they   support China against Hong Kong, it just says they do not permit   politics in gaming venues which is absolutely understandable. If they   allowed one instance, they will need to allow all - a pro chinese gamer   spewing stuff about Hong Kong too, some Israeli guy about Palestine and   vice versa, Trump haters, etc... Next thing you know their tournaments   would be a venue for polarizing political statements. I'm sure all  this  controversy is because that particular political issue was against  most  of what the western players uphold, but if it was an issue they  agreed  with they would have totally understood the decision... I'm  saddened to  see the west not upholding their own values and being  unable to separate  emotions from sound judgement. Really pathetic and  saddening. Blizzard  does not deserve all this hate for a sound decision  based on a contract,  for a very perfectly reasonable reasoning. People  seem to be dying to be in a situation to be self righteous, such people  probably do not enjoy anything anyway... shame... Oh and before anyone  says I'm from China or something - I'm Egyptian.
If you actually gave a shit you wouldn't go at all
If you're actually upset about this and have a ticket, please stay home. Some of us will be there trying to have a good time.
Blizzcon is coming up and nobody should actually go there!
How about not showing up
The best would be to not go, even if you have a ticket
Funny how anyone who says to not go to blizcon gets down votes
[deleted]
Or not show up at all and cancel Blizzcon tickets because that‚Äôs their paycheck.
[deleted]
Wear it underneath a black shirt and then take the black shirt off once you're inside with a bunch of other people doing the same thing. Would definitely send a message.
They can try that. Harder they will try to enforce something, even harder they will be eventually hit back.

I dont see Blizzard coming back from this. If I was Activision CEO, I would just cut my losses and sell Blizzard to whoever is able to buy it.
Ill still wear it lmao
Too late, it's sold out and non-refundable. Best way to make your voice heard is to go.
As many protestors as possible need to make it *inside* and here is why 

Blizzard livestreams Blizzcon live as both a promotionlal tool and revenue generator 

What we need to do is get some kind of Pro Hong Kong message shouted, yelled at every camera at every opportunity 

Panels , QAs, etc - Do not let Blizzard get away with a clean broadcast

They will have to choose between Pissing off China and scrubbing Blizzcon off the internet /cancelling streams

This will inevtiably hurt their wallet , they can choose between not making any virtual ticket money or pissing of the entire chinese market

up to them, they dont get to suck Chinese dick and enjoy our western liberal values at the same time 

Force them to choose
Wear mei or pandaren cosplay with Hong Kong support.
If you already bought a ticket, show up with a protest shirt under a cover shirt. Wait until you are on camera (a live broadcast would be best) and then take off your cover shirt.
You've spent your money. Use it more wisely. Don't be silenced. Use your voice.
No people won't do that because they're not really all that upset, they just want their upvotes. Of course they're still gonna go to the con, they paid money for it and it's something they wanna do.
Or just don‚Äôt go?
you could try but the way they have security set up now you wouldnt even beable to protest outside the convention unless you have a badge. You would literally be either on the sidewalk which is like 500 yards away where no one would see you or the parking lot structure where again no one could see :( you would more or less be kept with the crowds with the Hardcore christian groups that say were all going to hell...
Yeah you‚Äôll look just like those people who stand outside comic con with signs that says you‚Äôll go to hell if you‚Äôre gay. Enjoy that experience.
>pro free speech asshole

That's not a thing
Red because Op is pro-communist
Blizzcon seems to have trouble with people and red shirts.
someone knows how to follow the money
No! Go Inside! Everything is crowded with journalists, streamer, youtuber and the keynote is going to be streamed, too! Wear HongKong-Flag T-Shirts! So that on every Photo & Video the voices of freedom will be heard. If they try to censor it, then they can probably put out only 2 pictures and a silent Video cuz everybody‚Äòs screaming ‚ÄûFREE HONG KONG‚Äú anyways. 
Use the Medium and power they use to spread their information to SPREAD OUR VOICE!

Imagine every Blizzcon Visitor doing this. The blizzcon itself isnt even interesting anymore for the media itself. 


Turn this BLIZZCON INTO A PROTESTCON !


https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfekc6/please_dont_let_this_die/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
That's just being obnoxious to the visitors and it allows Blizzard to play the victim card. Take an example from the Hong Kong protesters who go out of their way to minimise how much they're inconveniencing their fellow citizens.
No, DO walk in. Make sure that every photo taken of the event has a shitton of people supporting Hong Kong. All the press will be about nothing but that.
no, everyone needs to force them to choose between live broadcrasting blizzcon or scrubbing it 


if too many people ask about hong kong in QAs, Shout about it on Live streams , etc 

Blizzard will have to choose between China and scrubing Blizzcon off the internet or the rest of us
I honestly think people forgot about what we are protesting for by the time blizzcon starts.
Come on now...
People paid money  people planned things. Don't think this will happen but 100% there will be protesters inside, visible on stream, shouting at panels and probably some get kicked. Think that likely is and a good message at least.
Not necessarily. I just think it will be say a little Chinese in flavor. 

The streams will have a nice delay, so they can cut out some unwanted stuff before it even has a chance to spread. Should there be Q&A sessions, they will be heavily moderated. Attendees will be thoroughly searched for protesting gear / banners. 

Basically if something happens contain it to the Con itself and double down on the measures to prevent it from happening in first place.
If this situation gets worse, it will.

There will be too many people to control for them to take this risk at this time. 

It needs to get a bit worse first, but they have only a few weeks till it begins, and they wouldn't cancel it last minute - so if they *do* cancel it, it would have to happen by next week.
This is team red shirt guy he hated blizzard before all this he had a voice and so will we
lol 
cant wait to see that.
Yes exactly they going to be looking for guys with blackshirts umbrellas and gas masks
Yeah. My thoughts too. Red = commie for years and years now.
For red shirt guy the first person to stand up to blizzard
Non refundable
Black clothing is too common to be noticed as a symbol.  You would need a mask, a flag, or some other unique symbol to make an irrefutable statement.
The employees can‚Äôt be taken guilty for the company‚Äôs decision, they need their jobs to survive.
It is to say f you again for diablo and honor the guy who asked about the out of date april joke, maybe.
You don‚Äôt know about red shirt guy?
[deleted]
Whoa now
It will be nice trolling and good protest
The security is really tight, the ticket is a digital QR code that changes every 60 seconds, I doubt that anyone would be able to pass with a fake ticket.
So the tickets can go to actual Blizzard supporters?

No thanks. Chaos will ensue.
Tickets are non refundable from I've heard.
Showing up in protest, showing up with symbols of the protest, the Hong Kong flag, etc. sends a direct message to Blizzard and their PRC overlords.

All relevant news from Blizzcon will be broadcast to millions.  It's entirely possible to create enough of a stink to make China outright terminate all dealing with Activision Blizzard.
From what I know, this was a thing for some time, people just never realized because they never tried to delete their accounts.
It‚Äôs a protest the tickets where already sold out
This time it‚Äôs red it has sentimental value
shall we naruto run in ?
> But I guess videogames at important, right?

Getting your voice heard at an event with a) a massive international audience and b) the utmost attention of the company that is trying to silence those voices actually does make sense though; Especially considering that the tickets are not refundable so the boycotting aspect doesn't really work (which would otherwise be a valid approach of course).
So what's the activision blizzard paycheck in Egypt? Good enough to survive a whole month on? I know western companies love oppressive regimes as that gives them cheap, almost slave, labor. Hell, Trump is trying to implement that in the US as we speak.
The sun in egypt is clearly hitting you to hard.blizzard is appeasing china.a country who is bathed in blood.hong kong is fighting for freedom,and they ban a player,revoke his HARD earnings for speaking out?a fine would have been enough if they wanted to keep politics away from the tournament.maybe,at most,a 2 months suspension.this is clearly pandering to a country that glorifies suppression.you have no idea what your talking about.get your shit together.what you wrote is disgusting
How much were you paid for this shitty comment? Not like you would understand anything about Hong Kong anyways given your countries proclivity for killing those you don‚Äôt agree with
Tickets were sold out long before the blitzchung ban, people may already have plans about staying  somewhere, since they already have the arrangements why not?
Do you not have a phone/human rights?
I‚Äôm going too. I really would like to enjoy the event despite all the mistakes Blizzard is making because I‚Äôm not guilty of it. I come from a poor country and I‚Äôve gathering money for a long time so I would be able to realize this dream travel. But honestly, I think that there will be very little protest because most of the protesters now are only people trying to get attention on the internet and the hate cycle will be turned against something else when the event time comes.
That doesn't achieve anything though.
No, people need to go. You can't be heard sitting at home, patting yourself on the back for not attending something you already paid for. However, you can help keep the momentum going by protesting publicly!! Voices need to be heard.
It‚Äôs a protest we need our voice heard
People already bought non-refundable tickets most of them have made plans with airlines, and hotels near by among other things. No point to tell them not to go for those that decide to protest should be giving a chance to at least protest in some way.
As everyone else said the tickets are already bought and are non-refundable so the best course of action is to go and PROTEST
It‚Äôs a protest we need our voices heard and you really think no one will show up to a sold out event? If we get enough press at their event we will get more eyes
People are already planning on wearing black shirts instead, since it's the color of the protesters
BLACK is the colour code for the HK protest, RED is the Chinazi colour instead
Wear printed shirts with large letters and meanings underneath. 

#F 
to pay respects
#R 
to reload
#E 
to equip

Etc.

Get a bunch of people to spell out Free Hong Kong
Black is the official color of HK protestors
\*disney drooling for the chance\*
No. The best way to protest would be to not go in. Leave them with empty floors. Protest in front of the venue with your ticket in hand.
I was able to refund mine
Then go but dont enter. Protest in front of blizzcon eventhough you have a ticket. Press will make pictures of empty blizzcon halls despite sold out and protestors massively in front outside of blizzcon.
Uhhh no. Just don't go. It's that simple.
I hope people will really voice their opinion there. But only few people will risk getting thrown out after paying 200$.
Non-refundable? Bet. I‚Äôll file a claim with my bank. They will get it back for you.
It can be non-refundable all they like. You can charge back with the bank
They will regulate their q and a. But we know blizzard has people who don't agree. Try and get someone in there. No need to ask about human rights. Just something uncomfortable enough to let them know we got past them.
So they air these brodcasts in China?
Because a lot of the people that purchased the non refundable tickets are probably planning on going to protest.
Enough people and it doesn't matter where they are. They will be seen.
Yeah--it is. See: anyone that defends racism, sexism, etc., using "free speech."
What about a very angry libertarian?
inb4 "No national shirts or protesting allowed in blizzcon" lol
Tbh if someone was going to blizzcon not to protest then I wouldn‚Äôt really care
Yea but isnt blizzcon like next week? If it were 2 months from now i'd agree but the wound is still fresh.
yeah i totally agree, people are all emotionnal about it right now but with time, ea or an another company will do something and the outrage of the week will move on them and everyone will forget about the coward at blizzard.

which is sad.
People will indeed have forgiven/forgotten enough by then.
The total revenue of the event would never match the potential losses they can have from one bad moment that goes viral.

Never forget that. Money can printed, it's on paper. Your image though, that takes a very long time to rebuild or rediscover.

China's never cared about money - they are devaluing Yuan on purpose to keep business relations with the world - just to stick it to the US Dollar. They care about their image and what their citizens think of their government.
Yes but it's not exactly relevant to this current situation. Just saying, there's gonna be people protesting the same thing using different mediums, not very unified.
Well, the irony xD but he isn't with China and at that moment, the concerns were about the mobile game, today the concern is freedom.
Everything is refundable.
The deposit/reservation fee can be non-refundable if it is deemed fair.
They can not claim the entire cost of the ticket to be a reservation and still claim it to be fair. 

Then there is the fact that you can always chargeback.
it's possible to continue working for blizzard while submitting resumes to other companies. the problem is where do you submit that doesn't have tencent involved.
So as the soldiers/commanders/generals who shot people dead in brutal dictatorships. You know the company is evil yet you decide to work for them to make money, it's as bad as company's decisions.
Oh I do but the HK protesters wear black with umbrellas. red t-shirt guy might be interpreted differently since it's a color of good luck in China. To reference red t shirt guy you need to be in front of a camera asking awkward questions which I hope happens to address the giant elephant that will be at Blizzcon
Full speed ahead
Yes, because shitposting will surely help.

I'm sure you sitting comfortably in your chair/bed posting memes on reddit will make the protesters who got tear gassed feel so much better.
then let's sneak into blizzcon! they can't arrest all of us, right?
Nah wont make a difference, you have already lined their pockets so why would they care? A company who only cares about money can only be hit in 1 way, by not paying them to enter, it's that simple, guess people still dont understand how boycotts actually work
thats what pro china people wear tho cuz thats the colour of their flag
Absolutely - anything to get to their inner circle
Is that supposed to imply that I'm being paid by them? Again: pathetic and simplistic reasoning. Is it so hard to understand there is an independent opinion opposed to yours? And yes a small paycheck from Blizzard would probably allow me to survive a month, or probably much more than that. The typical Egyptian has very low income by your standards. Very classy of you to bring that up.
Wow everyone who is not of your opinion is paid, huh? Such a one sided way of thinking. Also, you are demonstrating exactly what I have been talking about in my original comment. My position regarding Blizzard's action says nothing about my opinion about the Hong Kong revolution and the Chinese oppression, just as I see that Blizzard's action does not say anything about their opinion on the matter. And what does my country's government have to do with me understanding what's happening in Hong Kong? We had our share of revolution and oppression too btw, and we still do. As for you however, I do not know.
That's a fair point. I retract my previous statement. Troll the shit out of that place.
I've got both and so does everyone else with a BlizzCon ticket. I'd like to enjoy the weekend, please.
I hope you're right. Have fun! this will be my first BlizzCon even though I've been a pretty hardcore fan for a long time.
Protest on the front gates then. And dont bring a red shirt, people will think you're pro-China or pro-comunism.
Oh ok. I was not aware of that
Ah, didn‚Äôt know that. My bad.
I heard they prefer the color black over red, so the color of the protesters is black. They even made a black version of the flag
E to examine

H to heal 

O to obey

N to negate

G to grenade

K to knife

O to overwatch

N to necessitate

G to grind
Blizzard will just fill the floor with people who work for them or actors paid to cheer. Best option is to be able to disrupt the live shows.
Oh please, they sold out. There are still enough fans willing to support the developer of their favorite games. Im by no means a shill or even a blizzard fan, but even i realize this loss is only temporary.
If everyone shows up in red shirts saying Free Hong Kong they won't be able to stream anything, which means their marketing investment won't have as much impact as it could have.  Then the media outlets and social media sites will be flooded with how they didn't stream the event due to the Red shirts, it would show censorship and possibly draw even more attention than if they were to stream it.  They've already got the ticket money, it's best to put your ticket to use as a vehicle for protest versus not showing up and them just replacing you with some random joe off the street to fill a seat.
this 1000 times
No, Blizzard livestreams Blizzcon as both a promotional tool for their games and a revenue generator 

As many protestors as possible need to make inside and get as much PRo Hong kong shit on camera as possible

This will force Blizzard to either cancell streams and censor Blizzcon entirely OR piss off the chinese 

The Virtual Ticket is huge for Blizzard in terms of not only making money but getting promotional material for their games out

We have a means of forcing them into choosing between dropping the virtual entirely and not streaming shit or pissing off the chinese
Actualy the best but cruel way is to go and put pressure on any blizzard employee which would make their job difficult which would stress them which would than trickle up and down cause pressure ,stress and issues at blizzard.

It's not fair but realisticly it's the best way to get result.
The best way to protest would be to go, sit down for the presentations and then when they start everyone just gets up and walks away.
Not going is a protest. Wearing the shirts is humiliation.
Or go in and mess up the streams by wearing/having pro HK stuff to get on their live streams. Force them to spend more to censor it or lose on their live stream or piss off the Chinese
If they won't stand up for what they believe in because of money, they'd fit right in at blizzard.
Usually.
Or people who openly advocate for private corporations like Blizzard or Disney to have complete freedom of what they do and put on their ToA all because right good left bad, always leading to scenarios where the consumers end up utterly subjugated.

When you seek to push a particular cause, it's worth studying the mechanics of [reactance](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/learning-work/201712/don-t-tread-me-psychological-reactance-omnipresent). Most people don't feel strongly one way or another unless you push them to, and when you do they rarely side with you.
3 weeks from now.

Honestly, enough time for the internet outraged cycle to move on 5 times over to something different.
What if I told you the people upset with EA would be a different group of people? If you are a huge blizzard fan, it's not like you are just going to forget about blizzard. 

I understand that the media spotlight will eventually shift from blizzard, but all that will remove are the people that don't pay attention to blizzard anyways. You'll still be left with fans of blizzard still unsure how to proceed with their hobby. 

It's not like you are going to get a collective "I guess mom isn't watching anymore, it's time to play WoW." Do you honestly need the complete attention of the world to boycott something? 

I don't think this sub is going to recover any time soon. Even after another controversy strikes. This place will be left a ghost town before it starts to get positive.
it's not sad  it's a legit strategy that most of the people in power employ.  the goal is to create so much horrible shit that it mentally exhausts you. 

I hope blizzard crashes in eu and na
I seriously doubt it. 

Don't you guys have phones? That was a while year ago. People will be going into blizzcon with THAT in their minds. This is definitely going to be super fresh, and just the fact that they are surrounded by blizzard will make people constantly think about it.

Forget?....maybe. Forgive? No.
I just really hope im wrong and people will continue to protest and dont forget about it. But no matter, this all is still very good for hong kong, they are full in the spotlight and making more and more people aware.
People will be going there with last year's scandal on their minds.

Three weeks, after a bigger one IMHO, is way too short.
There's nothing left for me to say.
Good luck, like I said, the security is tight.
Nobody's paying them additional money.  Tickets were sold out long ago and are non refundable.  Showing up doesn't give Blizzard money.  Staying away doesn't keep money out of Blizzard's hands.

I guess people could boycott by contesting the charges on their credit card, though that would technically be fraud.
But mah red shirt guy
It wasn't about you personally, just about you defending the company that wouldn't think twice before it exploits you and the situation you are forced to live in.

And yes, it was an implication that you're being paid by them, as I don't see why would anyone defend such a dick move they pulled. Then again I'm old enough to know that most of the people just turn a blind eye to the things that don't concern them directly. 

And I have to say I'm pretty glad to see that a lot of young people are taking their time to actually point a middle finger to someone who didn't wrong them directly, that's something a lot of boomers didn't count on when they went on their "divide and conquer" agenda.
That blizzard money must be good.
Also the blizzcon site says the tickets are non-refundable so people are feeling obligated to go. I second your idea.
Tickets were purchased, hotels reserved, and flights were booked 6 months ago.
Same for me, I‚Äôve been a fan since Warcraft II but never had the money to go, now I will :)
When it says free Hong Kong?
Right? Idk if they still scan Q&A questions but someone needs to do yet another embarrassing Q&A question about the situation. Especially in the Hearthstone Q&A if they have one. Maybe for Overwatch asking for a Hong Kong Mei skin
Maybe Chinese students rallied by the embassy.
Okay, so we coordinate JUST enough people to disrupt them so that way we can still get them to throw their money in the trash on actors just like we did with their games.
thats alot of money for nothing
If they mess up Blizzcon again I think they might finally be screwed. Here's hoping!
Wait is this satire?
[deleted]
I feel like making them spend more money is a good thing. It's another attack on their wallets.
DISRUPT THE LIVE SHOWS FTW
LUL bet they won't spend that sort of $$$
It would spin a completely different story in the news cycle than the one they want to tell.
That wouldnt do much, the best way like previously said above is to go in attire forcing you to be kicked out for your opinion or them censoring you.

If you leave that your choice, if they force you to leave that their choice and their choice speak mile above your.
Consumers are not subjugated. They have a choice to buy a product or not buy their product. Not buying their product would be the best choice.
inb4 implies im saying this before they do it. They certainly havent yet, but I can see them doing so with the amount of shit theyre gonna get at blizzcon
I know all that but I think this is big. The public can wait. It‚Äôs not like people are gonna beat up visitors.
Too big to crash for this kind of thing
Channel your inner photoshop power. It shouldn't be that hard
From far away people wont be able to read what's on the shirt.
The official government flag of Hong Kong has a red background, the protester flag has a black background in order to remove the Communist element.
Wont happen.  


Either no Q&A, or they moderate the questions *and* have someone in charge of reading them to prevent anything they cannot control.
i guess this year there will be no Q&A. It would be surprising to see coming from a bunch of cowards like blizzard

Maybe some kind of "staged" Q&A where paid shill will ask question that will make china and blizzard happy.
It's advertising.
No, this is known to happen at game conventions. E3 presentations often pack the first few rows with people they can guarantee to cheer during the stream.
Problem is that the people who did that weren't able to know this would happen, so their stuck with them.
They'd have to pay more for standard advertising.
People spend a lot of money to go to BlizzCon. And I mean A LOT of money. Take time off work, planning, etc. 

People go to BlizzCon to escape reality and politics.

Protesting is great, and it's anyone's right. But protest outside in front. Don't be an ass and be obnoxious inside, ruining other peoples' enjoyment and time and money. Be considerate.


Wear a pro-Hong Kong shirt. But no one wants some guy yelling out shit during panels etc.
don't get me wrong i still upvoted but i feel like its better if we're represented correctly
I mean it just needs enough people to yell something...you know like a slogan or something
every live stream panel, qa or event the crowd should chant pro hong kong stuff

force blizzard to cut streams to appease china and farther hurt their rep or take our side 

THey dont get to make money on virtual tickets this year if enough people force this shit on their cameras everytime they turn them on

Blizzard will have to again either not stream anything at all or censor us to appeause china

LOSE / LOSE for them
They can't control the audience if they star singing "do you hear the people sing"
They are going to heavily moderate the questions and likely have an intern or something read them
Even without all the botcott and Chinese censorship shit, I still think they would have moved forward with this approach after the whole 'out of season April Fools joke' comment and the overwhelming negative Diablo Immortal announcement.
Found the one sane person in the wild.
Thank you!
people neeed to be yelling shit at the cameras , on panels at QAs

Force Blizzard to choose broadcasting Blizzvcon or scrubbing it to appease China

Thats the best protest - they dont get to make money on virtual tickets this year



Force Blizzard to choose between Broadcasting Blizzcon and offending china or Censoring Us
Hell no. This protest is more important. Blizzard lost their right to any modicum of respect when they bowed down to China like this. Absolutely abhorrent.
A well-known one that‚Äôs around maybe eight words, perhaps.
If they put the stream on delay and cut it whenever something like that happens they're "safe".   
However, if they do that in the middle of them talking it'll be quite obvious, but most people will think it's a stream error.   


I'll have my popcorn ready when it's the day. I hope they make themselves heard, but it wont be easy.
Maybe don‚Äôt announce shit reskinned mobile games to a huge PC crowd and hype it like it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbig‚Äù Diablo announcement to a community who is starving for any good news for their franchise.
[deleted]
I‚Äôve got a catchy one that‚Äôs two words for afterwards
Do you guys really not have any smartphones?
Not if it constant. If it none stop they will have to cut the stream. The crowd should sing " do you hear the people sing"
I still enjoy the content they put out and support Hong Kong.... but if people want to be obnoxious assholes and ruin the experience, I and most other sane people are going to shift our displeasure from their actions to the people protesting and disrupting the experience. 

Make your presence known, but in a peaceful manner that doesn‚Äôt ruin the experience for those who want to enjoy the experience. The developers who are going there to present their work had no part in managements decision.
Protesters need to cause inconvenience  to amplify the message. Why do you think the protesters in Hong Kong were shutting  down airports and highways.
Ooh ooh I know, is it "You're banned"?
Hopefully that'll be the case. But it'll have to be planned.   


If only a few people speak I'm afraid they'll just be kicked out. This needs to be bigger than that.

Can somebody edit it to ‚Äúmoney‚Äù and ‚Äúhuman rights‚Äù

Activision really. Bobby Kotick has been the master of the company for a while and the company should have been boycotted immediately upon acquisition. The fact people only are doing it now just goes to show they don't care about very much but at least finally something woke people up.

We should demand his resignation and demand he be replaced with a Blizzard CEO from the pre acquisition era.
I was on the Diablo immortal side of this argument. Its perfect for mobile controls, I was looking forward to playing it on the toilet or wherever I was. But I will not support tencent now. 

Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!
stupid, china was on one child policy for a long time and is aging in population
I remember the first time i played Diablo. It was in a semi-detached house I rented with three other students. The house was built very shoddily just after WWII when there was a lack of housing. The area was bombed in 1944, when the allies tried to damage the submarine bunker Bruno. I didn't have a computer capable of running Diablo, but two of my flatmates had. One saturday in the autumn of 1997 they arranged a LAN-party with some friends to play strategy games, but during the night one of the friends wanted to play another game: Diablo. When the friends left and my flatmates went to bed in the early hours they let me use the computers. So there I was, sitting alone in the living room of a badly insulated old house with a sligth wind blowing and the branches of the trees outside occasionally brushing against the windows, playing a rather spooky computer game. It's a memory I'll never forget.
Jokes on Blizz, already boycotted, despite classic wow.

I mean, those are synonymous with a command economy. For markets to do their bidding or they force their entire market to stop consuming. That includes forcing their whole nation to not vacation somewhere to lower tourism income.

Only if you're an EU resident... which I am not.
Arguing whether communism is defined by marxist political theory or by the people calling their countries communist is a fruitless excercise. China has nothing to do with what many communists fought and fight for as long as the means of production are privately owned and wage labour/classes exist, but at the same time you can argue the usage of the word has broadened or changed its definition.
Some of us do think they are communist's still, but that only gets met with a litany of excuses/arguments about how they are more capitalist then communist these days.
Please follow your guide Joo Dee to your rooms.
I mean it‚Äôs not like any sane person could go a whole month without praising China! So why would they increase the safe period?

At work so can't edit it, sorry.
Well Communism never meant Marxism. If it did, then there would be no central government after the first few years and turn completely into a state bound confederacy. The USSR within the first year found out why you cannot take away private land ownership. Food production was almost cut in half after removing private farms. Lenin allowed private land ownership and private factory production after finding this out. China is smart, they are following 100 years of tested Marxists theory. And they know that removing land ownership lowers production. That's why they have a large upper class, who owns the production, and then an even larger slave population, who works within the privately owned land/business. Just like the USSR had. An insane amount of billionaires enjoying the fruits of capitalism. 

Communism does not mean Marxism. Look at it this way, who is the best Marxist candidate? Would it be a globalist fighting for a universal government in the UN? Or would it be someone who fights for their communities workers? It would be Trump. A true Marxist candidate would look like Trump.  Because he is fighting for his state bound nation within the world confederacy. A true Marxist, who has read his work, would understand why Marx used the word community and why he never intended to create a one world government. Marx never wanted global domination, he wanted thousands of communities to compete with eachother without going to war.

Communists a long time ago threw away most of what Marx was talking about. Russia was never following Marx. They used his name for complete global control. Marx never was a globalist. China and the USSR are globalists. The dictator of the proletariat is supposed to have a term limit. The workers of the world are supposed to unite and then end up competing with each other. That's a true Marxist.
If it sucks and oppresses people, there's a solid 40% of the country that will never admit it's communism no matter what the signs are.
Actually fun fact I think most cheeses without rennet aren't typically aged, I could be wrong
Brilliant!
Of course you got downvoted for that...
Marxism is most definitely not based upon competition- the whole idea is based off of cooperation instead of the competition present within capitalism. Marxism is supposed to bring unity and solidarity, not purposely sew division.
They have billionaires that own private property. By definition, they aren't communist. They are fascist. Tyrants tend not to care about ideology, only about what keeps them in power, whatever the cost. Authoritarianism sucks whatever form it takes.
> If it sucks and oppresses people, there's a solid ~~40%~~ 95% of the country that will never admit it's ~~communism~~ capitalism no matter what the signs are.
He specifically made the comparison of London and New York sharing similar clothing. Those markets should be completely different from one another. Meaning, there is still division and boundaries between communities. He was never talking about everyone getting along within the same community.
The USSR had billionaires with private property. You should do some more research into the USSR. Lenin gave farm land and factory ownership to people, because he found that communal land is not as well maintained and profitable as privately owned land. The USSR has a deep history of privately owned farms and factories, even after Stalin. What, you think the biggest McDonalds in the world would be built in a capitalist country? No. It was privately financed in the heart of a communist nation.

The idea that China is not communist because they have privately owned land and privately owned production completely ignores the billions in trade we had with the USSR. There were immense billionaires in the USSR too. A huge example of communism occuring is a large upper class, and an even larger lower class, with the middle class being the smallest. 

It is wrong to assume the USSR had no private wealth generation or privately owned land. Lenin found that our within year 1. Not trying to be a dick, but you're not historically accurate here with you're description of communism. It doesn't mean the government controls everything. Lenin found that out the hard way. Through a food shortage. China is not fascist, they are a text book example of command economy USSR communism. With rich land owners and a slave like lower population that always has to listen to the state.
Communism under Marxist political theory literally requires the abolition of private property- Marx argued it was necessary in order to have a truly equal society. When the USSR stopped COMMUNal ownership, they ceased to be COMMUNist
Marx never wanted equality in the scenes of every community being the same. He was never a globalist. He still believed in the free market. Authoritarian fascists used his name to create something different from what he was writing about. Communities. Once those governments strived for global domination and their leaders of the proletariat denied stepping down, that is when they stopped being a true Marxist government.

No communist nation has ever dissolved private property.

So that's how you get car stickers off. I've always been wondering about it...
I really love Overwatch. And Starcraft... And Warcraft... And Diablo... Activision is the worst piece of shit the game industry has seen.
Being an Overwatch fan, more than any other Blizzard game, watching this actually got me emotional... it was hard not to play OW anymore.


Fight on.
I also cancelled my WoW Classic.
Wet your windows first people!

The problems of buying tat. The thing they endorse is bound to change.

Imagine if that wasn't even OP's car LULW
Destroying stuff is cool but remember, it's not giving them any more money that's important.
Nice gesture !
put a team fortress 2 one and you'll get em
Turns out it's not his car
Respect
This is the kind of stuff I wanna see.
I have this really nice Overwatch jacket that's super comfortable and definitely the nicest jacket I own, as well as a wallet that looks like a pack of Hearthstone cards that is my only wallet and it's perfect for how much stuff I have. I wish I could just toss/burn them but they're items I use every day (especially with it getting colder), and I can't rationalize destroying them. :/
Hell ya brother.
Very random, but I really love that shade of blue.
Wish what a chad he took off his overwatch sticker what a prophet
Plot twist, this isn't even his car. He's doing this to all cars
Dude taking his stickers off... you know shits got serious!
Reddit freedom fighters, brave to the last man.
That'll show'em
Low key, I‚Äôm worried that if we all boycott Blizzard that just grows the percentage of the player base that is Chinese and that would incentivize Blizzard to listen to China more.

Not an apologists, hate how they‚Äôve conceded their values, but that‚Äôs just an honest consequence.
Modern activism at its best, a guy filming himself scratching a sticker from his car's window. What a wonderful time to be alive.

That for sure will hurt China and Blizzard.

Edit : For anyone wondering, i support HK, that said, i do not want childrens talking about politics in games, i support the bann on Blitzchung and i don't blame Blizzard in any ways for that. So don't ask me what i'm doing against Blizzard, i don't want to hurt them for that.
Where do I get a sticker like that? Honest question.
Nice car OP
Lovely color
im impressed you did that one handed while filming without accidentally scratching your car, lol.
Careful, you can see your face in the reflection. Wouldn't want to damage your social score
What is it that he says at the end? I can't quite get it. Nice gesture by the way, the video transmits a strong feeling.
A small price to pay for democracy
Insert toy story ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt wanna play with you anymore‚Äô meme
What tool did you use to remove the sticker?
You showed them!
SO MUCH COURAGE ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is that Kim dot com or bald john Goodman? I can't tell
I must have missed some new scandal.....to think they would drive a man to remove a sticker from his car, scary.
r/blizzard mods sorting your sub's comment sections by controversial default now? Every bit as classy as I would have expected!
Some people are ripping on you for this here, but I applaud you. I've been a diehard OW fan since beta. Last night, I uninstalled, as well as cancelled my WoW subscription. I can deal with typical video game business BS practices (eg. lootboxes, expansions, pre-release specials), but this was too far. And their half-assed excuse for an apology only made this worse. 

You people ripping on this guy. You have to realize... OW was life for some of us. I loved this game, it was part of my routine. I loved the characters, the lore, the gameplay (despite it's huge balancing issues as of late). I been playing (almost) every day since beta. OW has been there for me through rough times, through the death of my mom last year. I always had this game, a place to escape. And now... it's tainted. It's like the Cosby Show. You can't watch that anymore knowing what Bill did. That's the one thing I can compare it to with my level of disgust.
Poor guy, I'm sorry that ended up being a waste of money.
Thank you for liberating Hong Kong. True American hero.
So brave!
I've got that sticker and Hanzo's Dragonstrike. Thanks for reminding me to scrape them off.
Guess it's Over~~Watch~~ between you and Blizzard now, huh?
Thanks man, I know it hurt but it was the right thing to do.
Wow so beautiful and brave
Im glad Blizzard didnt cause you to scratch your baby.
This man is a true hero, a conqueror of oppression all around the globe. Surely we should all remove our video game stickers from our rear windshields - that is the only real way of stopping the big bad communist China. /s
Who‚Äôs car you guys think this is?
Get a Team Fortress 2 sticker!
I thought he had a hammer for a sec and I thought he was just bust the window!üòÇ
I love you
Brave man
shame activision is such garbage, i was really enjoying classic wow
Shoulda just smashed the whole window.
It would be funny if it wasn‚Äôt his car
The state of that blade leaving scratches on your glass really bugs me
So brave
people with tattoos feeling the pressure right about now.
That wasn't his car though right?
Probably someone elses car hur hur
Man, that hurt to watch. Thank you for taking a stand.
Tip: Soak er down with some hot soapy water first. Helps it come off easier
I like to think this isn't OP's car. He just found an Overwatch sticker in a parking lot and did them a favor.
Hey Rick, how's the pawn shop?
Stunning and brave
Surprised the window didn't scratch, thought I'm sure you would've seen marks at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7
Why is this sub defaulting to controversial sort
I really thought he was gonna smash his window
Should've set the car on fire at their HQ
*immediately signs into account when he gets home*
cringe to put it up there in the first place, cringe to record yourself taking it down
Did you throw your smart phone away too? It was made in a sweat shop
Should have replaced with a Hong Kong sticker
Blizzard getting hit hard and.. good!!
>Known as *‚ÄùThe Snowman‚Äù*, this serial sticky destroyer is lashing out at numerous victims across the tri-city area. Specifically targeting Blizzard stickers, the Snowman is still at large.
Man this comment section is a shit show
As bad as this whole shitstorm already was, they actually managed to make it worse with the news release earlier(friday evening).  Half-assed damage control with no actual apology, and a straight-up bold-faced lie about their motivations.
Bet this door handle feels that he has done something now
Putting a sticker from a videogame on your vehicle is cringey.
Just burn the car!
Well boys, we did it. Blizzard is no more.
Blizzard will loose some customers, but not nearly as many as if they stood up against China. Its all about the money.
Blizzard bad.
This comment section is...interesting...
... mine won't come off that easy... Issatattoo. After nearly 20 years of being a dedicated fan I figured it was a safe "I've loved them most my life. There is no way they'd disappoint me so much after all these years that I'd regret this."..... üò™
Can't believe how the tune has turned from yesterday to today on this subreddit. 
Where's the support? 

Are there so many Chinese agents here now?
*buys another overwatch sticker 2 hours later*
Filmed on a phone made in china, posted on an app owned by china.
Some people are being huge jerks. There is a point in posting this and doing what you did, it shows you care and it spreads awareness. 
We all have to do what we can to support real freedom and human rights even if its just a small first step.
That‚Äôll definitely teach them...
Don't let the haters  through, any act no matter how small is better than continuing to support any companies who bow to China.
This karma whoring is so cringy
Ah

This made me feel warm and fuzzy inside
Sweet ASMR
if you were really done with blizzard you would do that at the moment you found out about it , you shouldn't have waited to record it with your phone
Such an amazing sound that dull razer made all over your rear glass...
Should have left the "over".
I think it‚Äôs excellent China‚Äôs younger generation is taking a stand. But still just made a new character on Diablo.
This is the equivalent of someone changing their facebook picture to a picture of that country‚Äôs tragedy.
Should have kept OVER.
Future tip, use a blow dryer to melt the glue before peeling it off, less residue and chance of scratches!
thats how you remove car stickers???? :0
I thought this was going to be so dramatic, but then it was like, chipchipchipchip chip chip chip.
so brave, people in Hong Kong are safe now thanks to you, you really are the hero we deserve
imagine putting an overwatch sticker on your toy car in the first place. that video would be even more cringe than this one.
Bald people, no offense, are savages
I'm hoping that this was recorded on an iPhone : D
how brave of you, i bet that took so much effort to do, i mean you could have just done it and not posted it for points in a sub you know will give you points, you could quietly stop playing and only tell those you play way, but no those fake internet points will help out HK so much my hat off to you sir
Give you 5$ to smash the window in.
Best one yet
Wow so brave, truly inspiring.
This man has a life. cause he can stop playing Blizzard games.
This shit reminds me of when boomers were burning Keurigs and Nike's cancel your subscription and delete your account sure but the videos of people destroying merch I don't get.
I hope people start boycotting cod.
[Say the magic words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vyo4urabLw)
me uninstalling overwatch the other day
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Am I a pos if I still play overwatch?
uninstalled bnet several days ago... think i'll stick with private servers for diablo II + expansion from now on.

i'm sure a game that old has *some* somewhere out there...
Time to start getting the blizzard game tattoos removed.
Oh wow, you removed a sticker you already paid for from your car, that'll sure teach Blizzard
It sucks because I honestly love overwatch, but Blizzard Activision is trash
You done good but hope you didn't scrape the paint of your car over this.
So brave! We did it plebbit!
I feel you bro. Wore my Blizzcon 10 lanyard for work for the last couple of years now. Had to throw that garbage in the trash and get a new one
[deleted]
Well boys, we did it. Corporate greed is no more!
What a hero
I'm so disappointed in blizzard.
You will be back like everyone else will!
Ladies and gentlemen, China is no more. Look at this brave soldier doing his part. Rise up gamers. üò§üò§
Difficult to overstate just how dumb this is
Cool.  Pick up Rainbow  6 Siege and enjoy.
r/oddlysatisfying
This is so cringe, dude you're going to scratch the shit out of your car!
Now put a TF2 one on top
Goo gone!
I've always wondered how that scraper doesn't scratch glass, is it metal edged?
I think this man right here just finished Blizzard. Maybe Bernie Sanders can win now? Trump is finished.
Who made that phone youre filming on? üòÇ thats right lmao
Amazing

You are a real hero

I'm sure people in Hong Kong will sleep soundly now

Really, what is the reason you uploaded this? Showing off how cool you are by getting rid of an Overwatch decal, which isn't really something anyone should be proud of owning in the first place?

Well at least you got Karma, Gold and 3 Silvers, so congrats. Kinda ironic that people keep gifting gold and silver around here even though Tencent owns some shares of Reddit too.
I'm as pissed as anyone but Jesus people, give it a week before you destroy your stuff
No one cares.
So brave..... good for you for jumping on that outrage culture bandwagon. 

When in fact the guy broke the code of conduct and got penalized for it. But hey, gotta follow the rest of the outrage sheep to stay cool and relevant. 

Prime example of what is wrong with people today. No self thought and quick to jump onto the latest outrage topic.
was going to make a retort to how silly this is.

Then I noticed the reflection.
Wow I bet they felt that
I mean... They already have your money, you even bought a sticker. Christ this is pathetic...
Good job how is this gonna affect them business wise? Like seriously why don‚Äôt you go out and protest against the ethics of what they are doing with siding with China who regularly breaks human rights and the other companies that side with China instead of posting on a subreddit which upvoted  a whatsboutism that people who are lgbtq+ is somehow breaking their rules?
Omg u are SO HANDSOME!!
How brave of you
Then some Rubbing Alcohol to get the glue off!
Heat guns actually work the best.
TIL
Using a rusty blade is also how you scratch the hell out of glass.
Nothings faster than a bad ass pressure washer
I‚Äôm with you. I‚Äôm a huge diablo fan. I own D3 on every platform available but I can‚Äôt bring myself to play it anymore over this.


I was really looking forward to playing Overwatch on Switch too.
I agree that Activision is scummy af but lets not hide our head in the sand here, Blizzard has changed as a company and share equal responsibility in this. 

It was Blizz's game, Blizz's tournament, Blizz's sanctions, and Blizz's grovelling apology to China. They own all of it from start to end.
I never thought I'd see the day, where I could plainly state "I've played an EA game today" without feeling a little dirty.
same here, overwatch was one of my favorite games until recently
Really a shame cause like blizzard they used to make really good games.
A company is only as good as the people that work for it. The passionate gamers who created Blizzard's legendary titles have left the company. There are still passionate gamers at Blizzard but obviously they are not in a position to make any difference.
Then it's doing its job. Everyone handles things differently. I totally understand. I gave 20 years of my life to blizzards games. But I also need to be able to sleep at night. I can't sit there clicking a mouse thinking about how they are a part of the mistreatment of people.
Right there with you man, I miss the shit out of Overwatch but it just wouldn't be the same even if I went back and played it. What would Reinhardt say? :(
My gf and i were playing o.w together every night  until this happened.

It does hurt.  I just got to diamond as hanzo. But our world is worth fighting for!

Fight on.
Not as good but theres still smite and paladins for the fix
Quick question, how is not playing ow bad for them if you already dont pay for any micro-transactions anyway?
Replayed OW after the situation and surprisingly didn‚Äôt give a shit, all that happened was that I remembered how fun the game is.
You already bought it, just don't buy lootboxes and take up server space.
Refund W3 preorder
wow.. so brave
i can haz all your gold?

^^^^^but ^^^^^srsly, ^^^^^that ^^^^^took ^^^^^guts. ^^^^^am ^^^^^proud ^^^^^of ^^^^^you!
Admirable!
(For anyone not aware, the wow devs, or really any devs, had literally nothing to do with the recent Blizzard acts against Blitzchung. By protesting in this way you are doing nothing but protesting the hard working and creative minds of blizzard employees who work to bring you these amazing game worlds. Be careful not to conflate this with the nasty corporate stuff.)
Congrats?
Second that!
LOL that would have been Epic!
I thought this too

Saying corporations "feel" systemic pressure to ignore human rights, or anything other than their bottom line is like saying water "feels" like flowing downhill, or objects thrown up in the air "feel" like falling back down. Focusing on profit above all else is an inherent quality of a free market economy, and is by design. Any consideration of an individual's rights is either coincidental, or done to avoid backlash that could negatively impact sales.
I agree and I hope that we can make some changes. At the same time I have a hard time blaming some of these people, I wouldn‚Äôt do this shit but, it‚Äôs hard to say no to billions of dollars. Plus, In line with what you said, if companies didn‚Äôt outsource work to different countries and did everything in the U.S, stuff would be more expensive and when people have to pay more for their stuff then we would see how many people actually care about ethics and morals. It‚Äôs a slippery slope, I hope if I were in a situation where I was making big decisions I could keep a level head and not focus solely on profits.
And this is why for a while I've stood opposed to the open stock market on the whole. To the point of outright refusing to partake in anything that involves it, in any capacity.
The economic system doesn't need to change. Our system makes it so companies are driven solely by profit, which makes it very simplistic to reward and punish certain business decisions. They are driven by profit because they need to be competitive, because markets inherit our values of democracy and freedom. 

Society needs to be able to agree upon some universal set of morals, despite the fact that we all have our differences, and be ready to take action in response to defend those morals, even if it means something as simple as not playing a particular video game. Being skeptical such as saying "why even bother, everyone is going to forget in a day or two", or not participating is what lets these companies continue to operate and do so without any incentive to change. Skeptics and cynics will always look for justifications as to not defend these morals mostly due to ignorance. After all, they continue to live here and benefit from them.
Thats why I cancled my WoW classic.
I requested an account deletion. Not only do I not wish to give them money I‚Äôd just assume trash what I have and scrub my info.
Better yet, Battleborn
Kind of the same with my overwatch razer headset. I really like it even if it's practically falling apart now.

Thankfully I didn't spend a dime for it. Got it from that Taco Bell promotion.
I don‚Äôt see any stickers here?

Taking DECALS off is always an emotional time.
This won't. But your comment will!
[deleted]
Right? Guarantee this dude did that. Went home. Thought about it and still fired up Overwatch.

But whatever get that karma boy
Per capita I think Western gamers spend more than Chinese gamers.
Well then it can become a company that make games for China, I'm sure there are companies out there that still want to make money from countries other than China, it's not like they don't make any money here at all, you gotta choose your target audience, and in most cases, you can't have everything.
Yeah, but staying put for that reason is a losing game. They've ALREADY declared China is more important than human rights. They aren't going to suddenly do a 180 and start treating their employees well, letting them actually have voices, etc.
What values have they conceded ? Did they unfairly force a rule? It happens to go with a view you agree with so what you aren‚Äôt allowed to bring that up in game chat . It‚Äôs not like the guy said something outside blizzard and got banned no but you guys acts that‚Äôs how it is like blizzard went after him for his opinion
I see it as more of a "Call To Arms" ;)
Public/Virtual/Viral acts like these expose more people, keep more people engaged or updated, and spread the message further. Any little bit helps!
better than you doing nothing and crying about it
Surely this asshole comment will do more.
Thank you comrade xi
You‚Äôre talking about it... clearly doing something
You're just trying to justify your own apathy.
That‚Äôs the thing with this society. You‚Äôre so stuck up in big results. That you don‚Äôt even know anymore that all little bits help. That doing what you can is good enough. But no, you think way too big. And that hinders you if doing anything at all. 

Keep the focus on your locus of control bro. And the rest will fall in its place eventually.
I mean he's boycotting blizzard..??
Just like the rednecks burning Nike and Keurigs.
It's not about hurting them. It's about not supporting them, the hurt part comes naturally although slowly.
What are you doing?
Right, so what did YOU do? At least he did that much.

Go on, it's a simple question. Answer it.

What did you do?
They can't handle the truth
I have the same views as yourself.
Everyone who responded to you is right, and you‚Äôre silly.
It's funny because you just typed a complaint about someone complaining, saying that scratching a sticker from a car window isn't enough, when all you did was touch your keyboard. What a moron.
I made it on a vynly cutter.
We should force blizzard to ignore the rule on the gamer because it‚Äôs a view we happen to agree with that makes sense . The rule should be 

‚Äú all political and religious views are banned from being said unless it‚Äôs a value Reddit Americans like then we ignore it ‚Äú
Hey now this isn't a roast thread! LOL
A husky middleaged bald guy with a beard standing up for China by filming himself with a Chinese made smartphone

Reddit is truly the smug neckhair of unrighteous protesting
It hides upvoted comments and the majority of upvotes are going to comments that are pro-HK.

Sorting by controversial gives someone the impression there are many, many more people that don‚Äôt think this is a big deal. What that does is, for people who may not know what‚Äôs going on or not have strong feelings, foment apathy or even garner support for Blizzard. 

It‚Äôs another PR stunt the mods are doing and it‚Äôs sad.
Did his smart phone aid in helping a government silence a human rights protest?

Oh weird guess it didn‚Äôt.
Hey I am a busy guy I  did this on my lunch break. can't do it after work it get dark to soon!
I have never used those point and don't plan on it. I honstely don't even know what they are for. I don't really post much.
Thanks, I'd like to thank /r blizzard thread for the courage it took to acomplish this. It wa such an emotional moment in my life I will never forget where i was when i did the thing that I did and I did it well so very well, well I guess I will go play so Apex Ledgens now......

Posted on reddit, the app owned by China
It is important to keep this conversation on going so it doesn't get forgotten instantly.
So any post that does that is doing good work.
imagine being this upset by this post, lol
All of this reddit fiasco is e-warriors circle jerking to their karma whoring. Purely about boosting their √©go. All ignorant about the actual situation, but who cares? Let's just all farm.karma and act like we care about people in Hong Kong. We're great!
If I was an overwatch fan I don't know if I could personally stomach keeping memorabilia that is basically an advertisement for their product, but also, I also wouldn't film myself destroying it. It's basically virtue signalling.

But also...Blizzard should know just how upset their fans are. But also...the people at Blizzard who made the decision probably don't give a single shit and would sooner move to China than appease fans in the west.
Thats how long you hold on to your ideals?
Nike is the best example here. These folks are statistically more likely to play a Blizzard product in a few months when the 'negative press' blows over
A lot of people care. People are allowed to protest anyway they wish. There are countries out there (China) where they don't have that right. Keep it up anyone who disagrees doesn't care about democracy. Now go play your games and pretend everything is ok in the world. Because after all, ignorance is bliss!
You do - otherwise you wouldn't be here.
I wonder if this guy will be embarrassed about this video in another 15 years.
If he had gotten in trouble for breaking code of conduct, that's fine.

But the punishment has to fit the crime. Kick him out of that tournament. Have him forfeit a couple of matches. Fine him. But a year's suspension, his prize money taken away, and posting about the glory and honor of China is all too much for what he did.
"Herr derr large group of people agree on something I disagree with must be sheep obviously."

Most people acknowledge he deserved some form of punishment however also believe the punishment was much too heavy handed.  Much more important to people than that even is their handling of the situation after that and their willingness to play both sides of the field with their phony PR statements.  Their recent statements and even the rule he violated do not line up with their supposed ideals and it's not even that hard to see.

Accusing people of not thinking and being sheep while blatantly ignoring their side of the argument might be one of the most intellectually hypocritical things possible.  Also counter outrage culture is no different than outrage culture itself I hope you can see that you are no different than the thing you are judging here.
Imagine being such a garbage person to the point where you insult someone‚Äôs appearance.
True, but I think maybe the premise is no more advertising... I dunno.
Those items are advertising the user purchases. While they do have the money from the same they won‚Äôt get any future revenue.
Wow... a short video about someone showing that he won't advertise for evil while tending their activities of daily living and you try to shame them for it.

What's wrong with You?  Not everyone can be on the front lines.  WARS ARE ALMOST NEVER WON ON THE FRONT LINES.  What he is doing is small, but it takes MILLIONS of small actions in order to hit them where it hurts.  He is doing what he can, and you never know, he could be encouraging many others to do what they can.

Shame on you for trying to shame him.
In my experience WD-40 works best
Safer to use a razor blade (a plastic one for removing decals from paint).
Then some normal alcohol to forget that a once popular software company are now prepared to support the imprisonment, murder and organ theft from teenagers to suck up to their chinese masters.
Rub some Aloe Vera on it.
You should wet the surface before scraping. It will help prevent scratches from any dirt thats on the surface.
Shit*
I agree however I did want to run a cord out there!
Be careful with heat guns on glass I've seen them shattered from too much heat
You can't scratch glass with a typical blade (e.g. steel or iron).
This is what we use at work, with a temp set at like 180F
Maybe switch to poe instead of d3? I like it better anyways.
Blizzards board is to blame but the actual employees started walking out because of what they did
Where's the proof of this claim?
>The passionate gamers who created Blizzard's legendary titles have left the company.

There are a lot of old employees in Blizzard. For instance, Jeff Kaplan is in Blizzard since 2002, working as a designer first for World of Warcraft and now being the lead designer of Overwatch.
100%. 

Thankfully I have Bethesda to carry me through, and Warframe and No Mans Sky.

Ill miss Overwatch and Moira... I was starting to do well. But this is easily more important
LMAOOOO
Thats like saying you cant wear a Nike t-shirt because the workers that make them earn 1p an hour.
stocks, if a game loses its playerbase investors won't back it up anymore and it will lose stock power, so yeah, not playing the game hurts them more than paying or not paying the initial price of the game
Oh snap I need to do that also!
[deleted]
It‚Äôs not about playing the game it‚Äôs about not giving them money
Not really, I was having fun playing, but I can really only show my support of Hong Kong by not giving them my money. I guess I could write a strongly worded letter.....
One question: What do you do about saving for retirement?  My options are through company matching Simple IRA, and Roth IRA which use the stock market through index funds?
hahaha

the stock market is the most empowering economic system ever conceived

the biggest, most important companies in our economy, owned entirely by the general public. 

the biggest, most important companies in our economy, owned entirely by millions of people.

an abundance of economic and social mobility... and you idiots want to burn it down
I hate to break it to you but in the thousands of years of recorded human history, mankind has NEVER been able to agree on morals. That's not going to suddenly change because China's swinging its dick around and suddenly gamers noticed, despite them doing it for the past ten years.
There ya go
I'll be honest here. I dont have the balls for a full deletion
nah i dont think thats good
Okay I‚Äôm way too gay to understand the difference between a sticker and a decal?

How are they different? Genuine question.
Thoughts and prayers!
Remember, if you don‚Äôt immediately get the end result yourself you better do nothing.
China‚Äôs is actually already larger, mostly because they don‚Äôt have the same stigma on ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù games or buying addons like mounts or skins.

This is apparent as the next Diablo is going to be mobile to appeal to Chinese gamers and supposedly it was leaked that most of WOWs player base is actually Chinese. the WOW store even had a purchase exclusive Chinese style dog mount, way after MOP, so it‚Äôs hardly subtle.
> Did they unfairly force a rule

yes actually, if there wasn't political motivation to their rule enforcement they would have also banned the College team who held up a protest sign live on stream from competition, instead they were given their next match in the tournament.
Advocating for freedom against a fascist regime should not be offensive to no one but fascists. Blizzard‚Äôs values don‚Äôt include the rights of people.
See this is the apologist
Someone bought you silver for that instead of donating it to an appropriate charity.  Now thats funny.
are you doin anything about it except making a gain from people's temporary hatred to blizzard
Is it though
Most likely just about as much.
With this logic, I‚Äôm doing something right now that will eventually lead to Christina Hendrix walking into my bedroom and giving me a rim job.

Destroying your own private property that you've already paid for to own the Chinese government like a boss.
[deleted]
TBH it's good he commented, otherwise we'd all assume everyone understands why these little acts are important.

It's actually a great opportunity to share high quality thought.
[deleted]
Lol so you didn't even give Blizzard money for it? You basically just shit on your own product.  


Way to show em! /s
"Made" in this context means manufacturing, that's because of chinese sweat shops, the workers get paid jack shit for manufacturing the phones so businesses naturally contract them instead of paying a higher price for the same outcome. (in other words, contracting companies who actually pay their workers decently)

You really said a lot without knowing much about why so many products are made in china in the first place.
You‚Äôre so far up your ass. Do you feel like a hero yet?
sorry if my comment was offensive
I doubt anyone would buy Overwatch just because they saw someone with an Overwatch car sticker
Anyone who thinks taking off a bumper sticker doesn‚Äôt destroy the Chinese government must be a Chinese shill okay cool
Entire reddit is full of circlejerks about the situation. This one does nothing except for stroking his ego.
Thoughts and prayers.
What did Nike do? The Colin thing?
I hope you have stopped using *everything* that is china related in your life.
You clearly dont understand what care actually means then lmao. So jaded.
I'm sorry, who made you the punishment court?

Who determines the punishment? Oh, that was Blizzard, not some yahoo on Reddit. 

People world still be whinging no matter what the punishment was. No where have Blizzard stayed that they support China. This is just a fallacy propagated by the outrage culture.
[removed]
imagine being such a garbage person to the point where you judge an entire person by one reddit comment.
I didn‚Äôt insult his appearance. You did.
I am not shaming I am saying there is a lot more to do rather than destroying a sticker.
also works good!
A blowtorch is a lot quicker.

Sure, I concede, you might need some polish (or a new car) afterwards.
Funny story... WD-40 is the ONLY thing that will remove crayons from an LCD screen.

i.e. I took a nap around a toddler 10 years ago and learned this the hard way.
Found the engineer.
Just be careful with your cars‚Äô clear coat! WD-40 and iso are both solvents
Lacquer thinner is nice for it too
Goo gone also works pretty well.
WD-40 works on almost everything related to metals
Heat guns are no joke I melted the carpet trying to get some wax out. Thought it would be faster than using a iron.
Yes you can, especially if it‚Äôs rusty.
PoE is fully owned by Tencent.
Ten cen owns 40% of fortnite. Fortnite is owned and published by Epic. Epic made a statement saying they will not censor anyone for their beliefs. Ten cen owns 5% of blizzard I believe. Can you explain why they are okay with Epic‚Äôs statement but they‚Äôd strong arm Blizzard?
I tried it and I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan.
Warframe is also a good option. 

Almost always in top 10 steam games for 5 years. Game devs are located in canada and compamy was taken over by a firm based in hong kong. It operates a lot on the mainland as well but has always been kinda sceptical to china and often does things less appriciated by china.
There isn‚Äôt any. I‚Äôm not even a blizzard shill but I started researching this because it‚Äôs interesting to me. Turns out money probably wasn‚Äôt the reason behind it like everyone assumes it was. everything I‚Äôve gathered points to them basically trying to distance themselves from being a politica platform. They essentially had a gun pointed at them and had to pick which loved one was going to die. If someone can prove me otherwise then I‚Äôll gladly read
Indeed. We live in a time where the consumer has multiple options at any given time. All the more reason companies need to think about their customers and people. They need us more than we need them.
That's the thing, it's hard to give up on Overwatch when you've got barely any other games to play. The only similar title I play is Rainbow 6 Siege which sometimes simply tilts me and then I'm just stuck to being bored out of my mind.
Warframe is a good game. Its what got me to stop playing fortnite stw and eventually battle royale.
Ah, thanks a lot for explaining to my dumby brain
As Cartman said "When you pre-order a game you're just committing to paying for something some assholes in California haven't finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth."
Wube is.

Boycotts dont tend to work. This is just looking to damage the good side of blizzard.
Same position here. I was really enjoying the Classic grind. Oh well. If Blizz reconsiders their stance on HK I'm back in an instant.
Or if you enjoy playing then play, I am
Because it's incredibly flawed. You argue that these companies are owned entirely by the general public, but practically speaking the actual ownership and control falls under a comparatively tiny group of people.

People whose sole jobs it is to go around investing in companies to make shitloads of money.

People who *already had a lot of money to begin with*.

You see the problem here?

If it really was as simple as 'every company owned by the general public', we wouldn't be having this conversation. These companies do not serve the general public. They serve their shareholders. And themselves. That's it.

I don't like being cynical, but to think buying stock as a single person, or even as a large group of people, actually makes a meaningful difference in reality, when all the control still lies in the hands of a few people, who can just force their way in whenever they want, and give no shits about anyone else unless it makes them more money? That's naive *at best*.
Well maybe it's time, because we live in an age where you can get your message across to someone else in mere seconds and where we're all connected. There has never been a better point in time.

How exactly are you going to impose a change on the economic system without contradicting the idea of freedom? Everything you do is dictated by some sort of economic motivation. Relying on a businesses to uphold morals is naive and is what led to this situation in the first place.
I figure at this point I‚Äôve had my fill of the games I bought anyway and it‚Äôll be one less potential data breech.
tbh, you got a ton of other games you can play, and you could also spend that time doing something to improve yourself, there are a lot of other options, that not playing a game anymore is really not something that hard to do once you start thinking about it, of course, if you want to.
I believe it‚Äôs about how the image is being attached to the thing that you are decorating. When I think of a sticker, I think of an image that is printed onto one whole piece of plastic that is then stuck onto the item. Whereas with a decal (like for car windows) it can often come in many different pieces that require precision to place together properly, so if you‚Äôre not careful when attaching the decal it may not line up properly.

I could also be totally wrong, too, I‚Äôm not a professional so take this explanation with a grain of salt.
They are both just stickers. One just goes on a car
One is a sticker, the other is a decal. That's how I usually tell.
Are you weenies prepared to boycott Disney too?
But this literally does nothing. It‚Äôs not about giving up because you didn‚Äôt get far enough. It‚Äôs about doing something that is actually going to move you at all towards making a difference.
Don‚Äôt play that card . You guys were upset before that 


they didn‚Äôt do anything because  you guys make such a big deal about them fairly enforcing a rule  and PRESSURE them to pick what not to ban instead of just enforcing the rule by the booms they start to not be able to enforce that because if they banned them you cry babies would cry more

that‚Äôs facts
Bootlickers everywhere in this thread.
Sheep
lmao right
You know people don't have to buy coins right? I got platinum once so I had enough for one gold and two silvers (coincidentally, the same that that comment has), and I didn't spend a thing
and what charities have you donated to?
Its keeping the topic alive, and in the minds of our lawmakers as important to voters, so yeah probably
It is.
It's not
Blizzard just caved already. How much does China pay you per hour?
This only holds water if you have politicians and representatives who are willing to push legislation to get christina hendrix to rim you, based on populus support. 

Large numbers of people considering blizzards support of china over hong kong as an issue is already resulting in politicians making comments and taking it into consideration. 

I dont think there is a single representative who gives a shit if you get rimmed. Sorry mate
She‚Äôs more likely now than ever.  Good job!
I don‚Äôt know...personally I think it‚Äôs pretty petty to tell someone that they‚Äôre not making difference. They‚Äôre standing up for something they believe in. Criticizing them for they‚Äôre decision to do so is doing the exact opposite. OP‚Äôs doing every option available to him/her to make a statement.
I don't see what the edit has to do with my comment, or your original one for that matter.
Your edit means nothing. Keep whining though
> Destroying your own private property that you've already paid for to own the Chinese government like a boss.

Better than sitting back, doing nothing, continuing to swallow what they feed you, and keep paying for it like their servant.
>Edit : For anyone wondering, i support HK, that said, i do not want childrens talking about politics in games, i support the bann on Blitzchung and i don't blame Blizzard in any ways for that. So don't ask me what i'm doing against Blizzard, i don't want to hurt them for that.

So basically, you have no answer, not even something as 'inconsequential' as scraping a sticker off your own car window and having the guts to post it online.

Pardon my disbelief in your amazing valor and courage.
My point still stands even if you're a pro-censorship, "i do not want childrens talking about politics in games" is not a valid statement, you still typed your complaint with your keyboard and it's literally no better than him scratching a blizzard sticker off his car.
As opposed to destroying something when they already have the money?
lol what? he is taking away his public advertisement for them. why would he leave that on there after this? and why does it bother you that he posted it?
You're right, you should pay them money for something to destroy instead.  That'll truly show them. /s
Correct.

That is the meaning of the word ‚Äúmade‚Äù.
[deleted] LOL
I‚Äôm sure some do!
Reposts and upvotes.
Thoughts and prayers do nothing. How about you actually go there and fight side by side with the protesters? :\^)
Indeed. When Colin's commercial debuted, everybody "burned their sneakers" in protest to the terrible company doing terrible things to their terrible workers in that terrible country.

https://www.vox.com/2018/9/4/17818148/nike-boycott-kaepernick

But I guess what nobody figured is that these boycotts don't really last too long and the stock prices went up shortly after people forgot about that. Because you know, Nike got free exposure for months from idiots.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKE/history/

>Nike surged as much as 9.2% in early U.S. trading after its second-quarter results soared past projections, particularly in its two most important regions: North America and Greater China...The earnings report was Nike‚Äôs first to include the impact of its controversial ad campaign featuring quarterback-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick. The inclusion of Kaepernick in the line of ‚ÄúJust Do It‚Äù ads initially rankled investors, though they eventually applauded the move. Parker has said that the ads drove an uptick in traffic and engagement.

Don't forget, this also happened to Keurig when they basically said "Roy Moore is a disgusting pedophile" and Fox News went "No he's not" and all the Fox News fans broke their Keurigs in protest.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/keurig-boycott

Guess whose stock prices also coincidentally rose?

If you're breaking an item you personally bought in protest of a company and their actions, not only are you out the object you destroyed (shoes, coffee maker, whatever) but you're statistically more likely to repurchase that item once the hype dies.
Looks like you care as well
> I'm sorry, who made you the punishment court?

> Who determines the punishment? Oh, that was Blizzard, not some yahoo on Reddit.

Considering this is the biggest controversy in Gaming this year, and it's actually caused Blizzard Employees to *stage a walk out*, it's pretty clear that "some yahoo on Reddit" isn't the only one thinking this was over the line.
Responding to your comments in order.  First your response is almost as long as mine so I guess try not to exert yourself to much as well although it really doesn't take much effort to type things.  Second I responded to the one argument you seemed to provide so I certainly didn't ignore it.  Please feel free to correct me if I missed an argument in your first post.  Third I also looked at the situation from my own point of view which I outlined in the post above and came to a different conclusion than you it just so happens that in this case my views align with a majority of people's but that doesn't mean I didn't come to that conclusion myself.  And finally you accuse me of first agreeing with a majority of people and then follow up by saying I can't be seen agreeing with someone because that would look bad.  I even said I agree with you in my first post that he did deserve some form of punishment so clearly I can agree.
Calling someone a garbage person isn‚Äôt an insult to appearance, it‚Äôs an insult to someone‚Äôs character.
And not everyone is capable of performing every single thing that needs to be done.  But the bottom line is that he took a step in the right direction.  What is the purpose of trying to make him feel bad about it?
So does a hammer
A few pounds of C4 also works.
Many, many a night I craved some Polish.
NO NO NO NO.
What about playdoe?
Grim Dawn is pretty good and not chinese owned i think

also wolcen but its still in early access beta
The only thing I can say in PoE's "defense", on that front, is that at least it is completely and openly Chinese-owned. It's not an American company with only its toe in the water, still kowtowing to the Chinese in hopes they'll throw it some scraps. If GGG pulled some shit like what Blizzard did, they'd at least have the fallback of literally legally having to do that. 

Blizzard has no excuse at all.
Reddit is 20% owned by TenCent
Try [Grim Dawn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219990/Grim_Dawn/) instead.
Tencent doesn't fully own GGG. They only own 80% with the potential to own more in the future. Might see it as splitting hairs. But, still...
So far GGG hasn't done anything China support-y that I know of. I hope it doesn't come to that cause poe is my favorite game and I don't want to have to stop
To be fair, Epic's feet haven't been put to the fire in that regard.  Only if they end up in a situation like this will we find out if Tim Sweeney is talking out his ass or really means it.

That being said, I fully believe if Tencent is going to do this with a company they own 5% of, they sure as hell are going to try it with a company they own 2/5 of.
I don't think Blizzard even waited to see if Tencent would give them an ultimatum.  They reacted so quickly it was as if they were thirsting for the opportunity to prove how loyal they are to the Chinese regime.
Blizzard wants the chinese mobile market
Uh they had LGBT politics in their games, so they definitely have a political platform
I picked up csgo gun game for the time being lol
If youre looking for another hero shooter, you might try Paladins. Its not as polished as OW but its got alot of character and its free. Ive been really enjoying it in my down time from siege
Well, there is Palladins, I heard it's similar, I've played for about a hour, and it's ok, has heroes, card system...
...and there is TF2. It has a massive community, it's also class based, there are hats, friendlies, taunts, custom maps, random crits, fan animations, community servers and much more. The downside is that it's not that similar.
To be honest, I've never played Overwatch, so I can't really relate, but both of these games are free, so it won't hurt giving them a try.

And yes, I'm a TF2 player, but I think you should check out Palladins first, because the style of characters isn't that different, and if you're looking a replacement, not an alternative, that's your best shot.
Or watch "Meet the team" shorts. You'll see the style, the characters, that's what got me in this game... and meet the amazing pyro, this fan animation is gold.
Im only MR7 but I have a bunch of prime stuff.  That game on a 1440p/144hz is beautiful.

Nyx Prime and Loki :)
Go on‚Ä¶
Praise Geraldo
I was feeling that way, but this extended silence with no comment (to us, anyway) has shown me how little respect or even care Blizzard has for its player base.

If you look at the history of their responses to customer feedback about their questionable decisions, the response has always been "No, you're wrong.  We're right.  Just wait, you'll see how wrong you are," (e.g. "Don't you guys have phones?" instead of "Wow, we really thought our PC-dedicated playerbase would like this," puts the blame squarely on the players for failing Blizzard, not the other way around).  They've built up this extreme arrogance and disdain for their players, and it's really showing in the way they're basically ghosting American players because they're so sure that we'll all come crawling back at the next shiny event with new opportunities to give them money.  Why bother apologizing if you think your fans are just drooling idiots?  They'll be back either way.

They're holding up the people too addicted and locked into their games to care about anything else as "proof" that they're right, rather than looking at why people might be upset.  I have no intention of going back to a company that treats me like dog shit because it thinks I am dog shit.

And I'm really hoping that one day I have the emotional fortitude to stand firmly behind that and delete my accounts, because all I've had so far is cancelling a sub, getting a WCIII refund, and deleting the games and Battlenet from my hard drive.
You can't see any reasons people might choose not to do something they'd otherwise want to do?

A company provides a good or a service to the general public. They work to increase their market share and scale, trying to reach the greatest number of those in the general public as possible to maximum returns for their shareholders. If the general public stops using their good or service, their revenue drops and returns will drop for investors, making it less likely for them to continue to invest and for future potential investors to do so. The company will continue to run on what remaining money it has left until it goes bankrupt and ceases to exist.

Now the company is obviously controlled by those who buy into it. Anyone can see that. But there is also the idea that you and everyone else that can purchase their goods or services, controls them by dictating whether or not they continue to exist.
Oof. That's some pie in the sky ideas right there. The only way to have moral agreement is to force it, and the pursuit of utopia has been the excuse behind much of the evils of the twentieth and twenty first centuries.
If you think they ACTUALLY delete your info then you are foolish. You‚Äôre personal info is way to valuable to delete. They will just store it for now and sell it later, if they aren‚Äôt already selling it.
I've recently dedicated my time to learning Cubase and producing music again. You're totally right. There are much more productive things I should be doing with my time. I appreciate the positivity and wish you luck brotha.

So it‚Äôs like all decals are stickers but not all stickers are decals. I can understand that. Still think that leaves me with that decals are fundamentally multi part car stickers.

I feel like original ‚Äúactually those are decals‚Äù dude, has led me astray into thinking decals were some massively different thing. *shakes fist*
Thank you kindly although I feel I have been led astray by the original ‚Äúactually it‚Äôs a decal‚Äù, guy.

Yes.
Was that comment made assuming that boycotting Disney would be difficult? Lol
Yeah because US representatives are surfing reddit all day reading about neck beards jumping on the next hot thing to get their panties in a bunch this week. What China is doing is absolutely shitty but this type of shit is about as useful as a shit flavored lollipop.
This has the same affect as people burning their Nike shoes. Which is none.
Woosh

Only the so called biggest controversy because morons like you are making a big deal out of it.
No I knew that.

I meant , I wasn‚Äôt insulting his appearance.
I've been thinking, and I've come to the following conclusion:

Hammers and blowtorches might be a little excessive. An angle grinder, however... that might do the trick!
Or a belt sander.
And my axe!
I like to use my personal satellite that blast laser beams from orbit.
I played Grim Dawn in GOG. It's pure love and DRM-free.
You mean like Epic who is almost 50% owned by Tencent? I've played a lot of games owned by Tencent, people don't like to plaster their name everywhere because they're just in it for the money (Tencent).
But they know not to censor the /r/HongKong stuff, because if nothing else people would be pissed. It's possible to sell a non-majority portion of stock to someone and not let them undermine the values of a company - maybe Blizz could learn something from reddit.
5% IIRC not 20%.
Tencent has helped the Chinese government spy on people by allowing malware be installed with their software. Which is way worse than anything blizzard ever did. By playing PoE you support that company.
I didn‚Äôt play it much but I was surprised that the game had undead, skeletons etc. 

It didn‚Äôt come across like it had been neutered for Chinese audiences. If anything it was a bit too grim in places!
But they didn‚Äôt. That statement epic put out sets a potentially dangerous precedent for ten cen‚Äôs support of China. It doesn‚Äôt add up and supports the theory that none of this blizzard situation is directly involved with money and more on image and future representation.
You don‚Äôt need a fire before a company‚Äôs shareholders will want to put it out: that‚Äôs why corporations have so many lawyers.
It doesn‚Äôt make sense that epic would be allowed to put that statement out without ten cen shutting that shit down shortly after.
Companies do not wait for fires to start. They do their best to prevent it from ever starting. This is a case where I don‚Äôt think ever considered this and now they are dealing with it to prevent future cases of this
That‚Äôs so wild to even say. Listen to yourself. That‚Äôs some MAGA level shit
I wish our existence wasn‚Äôt inherently political
What do you even mean with that comment? I can‚Äôt even begin to rationalize it
Considering him getting banned had nothing to do with Hong Kong, no I don't get it
How am I trash for enjoying a game?
No one every said that, wtf is wrong with you
Where are you getting this idea of enforcement from? I'm simply saying that everyone needs to be able to hold themselves responsible and for those that feel they don't is the flaw that needs fixing, because of the fact that we live in a democracy and our markets reflect that, give us the power to also hold immoral businesses accountable, despite how cynical things may appear. And on a global scale, humanity at least can agree that we shouldn't kill each other, so clearly mankind can agree on some things.
I mean, if I wanted "cool" points I imagine I'd go with something other than a glorified dad joke, so... no, I think I'll stick with that.
[Um, buddy?](https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/policy/international/464990-lawmakers-criticize-blizzard-for-suspending-gamer-who-supported-hong%3famp)
except he literally made it himself and its sole purpose is to be an advertisement. so its literally nothing like burning a shoe.
Morons like the staff of Blizzard, who made the games you're defending as well, evidently.
Sure kiddo.
Better use industrial strength acid
Epic's playing a weird game right now, with Tim Sweeney speaking out against Blizzard while also having Chinese hands in his pockets.  I guess the best defense I can give Epic is that they're so gratuitously evil in such gross and overt ways that them being an arm of the CCP can't even damage their image.
They still let china invest and therefore profit from them, which just strengthens china.
Well idk I saw 20%
Hardly.  I've got family who've worked with businesses trying to break into the Chinese market, and it requires *years* of negotiations and strategic gifts to even be licensed to operate by the government, much less expand.  Blizzard's been pushing hard to get a foothold over there and it makes total sense that they'd be in panic mode if there was even a hint of that being threatened.

I'm not sure what's MAGA about that?  It involves actual knowledge of other cultures and how they operate.
Sadly, that's on Blizzard and other companies for using it as such.
They made many pro LGBT statements and supported that platform in their products, which is a political platform.  This disproves your point of them not doing that.

I'm not saying it's wrong, just pointing out their hypocrisy.
Tell yourself whatever you have to, little buddy.
Why are you a liar? Your parents were failures if they didn't teach you not to lie

Just pointing out the flaw in your logic. 

You enjoy supporting Chinese government, go nuts.
You instantly looked to the mans appearance.

I was talking about the phone.

It‚Äôs made in china.
I just use a nuke.
I'm inclined to agree.
We still talking about a car or Blizz .admin and Commie censors?
No I‚Äôm saying how you are able to just assume such a wild fantasy with nothing to back it up. There‚Äôs already hard evidence that this isn‚Äôt about money and more about image. Yeah it certainly could hurt their Chinese division. But there‚Äôs a much bigger picture here that people are choosing to ignore. I feel like you should see that since it sounds like you come from a business background just as my family does. Their global image is at stake now and it‚Äôs not because of the boycotting. If you can‚Äôt see that then I really do advise you look more into it. This is much bigger than the Chinese market at this point and I‚Äôm not talking about the western market
Are you saying the comments made directly from blizzards staff? The statements that were confirmed by a board? Was blitz part of this decision process or did he just excerise his right while taking blizzards away? Whether you like it or not, blitz doing this on a blizzard stream is making it political but not by their decision. There‚Äôs a huge difference and I‚Äôm honestly not sure how you can‚Äôt see that. I support LBGT but I don‚Äôt have to announce that unless I want to right? Have you considered how different it is to support LGBT and to support foreign affairs? Have you considered how different those two things are when it‚Äôs comingfrom a corporate environment? You‚Äôre still thinking from your own perspective. So is most of this sub. Taking his prize money was a little much. Everything else is fine. You need to set up a standard if you don‚Äôt want people to keep doing stuff like this.
It was courageous but also very misguided by doing this on a blizzard platform.
By your logic, blizzard should have never come out and supported anything because now it‚Äôs a requirement that they allow support on their platform that isn‚Äôt directly themselves saying it. So by your logic, it‚Äôs safer to keep your mouth shut which is pretty ironic. I‚Äôm outtie. This community is a bunch of morons
Supporting LGBT people isnt political, it's just being a good human.
Hence why I'm saying the truth
He broke the tournament rules, and was punished in line with what was in the rules he agreed to when he signed up, are you dense? Or just don't read and go with everything you hear?
What do you mean by "you people"?
Not supporting the Chinese government in any way
Proof?
From orbit, just to be sure.
Or maybe some of that shit Xi puts in the Uyghurs‚Äò water supply.
Yes?
But it HAS been polticized.

Preventing people from being murdered for protesting is being a good human too, but guess what? It's been politicized and Blizzard chose money over the people being brutalized. That's how the world is.
I don‚Äôt think truth means what you think it means. 

Enjoy your cognitive dissonance though.
Chinese apologists are first against the wall
Ok what about the Chinese cheaters in 2018 who were given a slap on the wrist and even brought back for all-star international ? https://dotesports.com/hearthstone/news/hearthstone-community-torn-over-cheaters-at-all-star-invitational


You know if the guy was just given a slap on the wrist it wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad but they came down on this guy hard, like it‚Äôs hard to not see it as a political statement from Blizzard
>and was punished in line with what was in the rules

A year, taking all his winnings, and **firing the two commentators on screen when he spoke**?? The rules you read in mainland China are obviously different than the ones we got in English.
 **Indifference** is not a response. **Indifference** is not a beginning, it is an end. And, therefore, **indifference is always the friend of the enemy**, for it benefits the aggressor -- never his victim, whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten.
You said your piece to instigate drama. You didn't need to respond to this post. But you just HAD to. Move on bro, go read things you enjoy. Contribute actual things to conversations. "Congrats?" Was a dick move.
It‚Äôs in the pudding
Oh I get it, but supporting LGBT people SHOULDN'T be political, it's a  neutral thing that is neither positive nor negative. Oh well at least I can boycott blizzard.
They didn‚Äôt do that though. You‚Äôve fooled yourself. How much have you actually researched?
Who in here is a chinese apologist? I am backing blizzard, not China
I've never heard of that incident, but it doesn't negate the fact that he broke the rules and was punished
No the ban was different and extreme,  the casters were literally separate, and the winnings were in the rules
Did I ever once say I didn't dislike the Chinese government or that I like what they do? No, didn't think so
And this post didn't need to exist, this fake anger over china is sad and doesnt need to exist either
about what I expected
Right, what they're saying is neither should supporting the people of Hong Kong
[deleted]
Blizzard's backing China.  Guilty by association.
Yeah and Blizzard didn‚Äôt have to come down on him that hard, by doing so it‚Äôs really appeared to cement their political stance against saying things that would upset the Chinese government. 


It‚Äôs not just the players haven‚Äôt you seen the Blizzard employees protesting as well?
Words and actions are very different things.
Just because you don't care doesn't meanothers are faking it. Even if they are? Why do you give a shit? 

You just wanted to come in here and be edgy. We get it. Very brave. No go log onto wow and understand thats where your morals lie.
Good debate. Appreciate you admitting you‚Äôre wrong
They really aren't though...
Ok, if you dislike China so much, get rid of your phone, your car, the clothes you wear, hell stop using reddit honestly. Otherwise you are no better
You do know it wasn't the protest that got him banned but breaking the contract, right?
Yeah, they really are.
My phone isn't from China. My car is European. My clothes are all American made, and Tencent owns a 40% share in Reddit and as far as I can tell Reddit isn't removing my pro-Hong Kong posts and comments, so I think I'm good. Your logic is hot garbage anyways, that's like saying you shouldn't try to eat any healthy foods if you don't plan on eating exclusively healthy food.
No shit. Does that make it right?
Show me a statement issued by them that backs this claim
What phone do you have and what car and clothes do you have?
It was literally in the contract he signed and the rules for the tournament.  So yea kinda does. Heavy-handed punishment? Sure, but he signed up knowing what the punishment would be
...the banning of Blitzchung and subsequent apology to China..?
Maybe you should look at this https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfkmp1/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/
Moto X and a Subaru.
Okay, Blizzard participate in gay rights activities.
That website is edited by china so it very well could have been made more china friendly.. and his banning was for breaking a rule he agreed to
That website is quite often edited by china to be more friendly to them.... not a source
So China and nothing
And? That was random
Whatever helps you sleep at night.
Motorola is an American company and the Moto X is manufactured in the US. Almost all Subaru's are made in Japan, with the only exception being some assemblies in the US. idk what you're on.
If Blizzard are allowed to pick and choose which political standpoints are and arent alllowed, they can get fucked. Your inability to join dots is quite impressive.
Drink soup
So maybe kudos to you but made in America doesn't mean American parts,  also Google owns Motorola so yea good luck with that
Well with minimal information to even know where you were going with that.

And fair enough,  so anyone should be able to use a tournament interview and blizzard's platform to say any political stance they have at will? That what you are saying?
Correct. *especially* if they are advocating for freedom.
Ok, so what happens when a klansman gets on there and spews his horrid views? You'd have to be ok with it and not punish him too
Correct, you dont have to punish people for dumb views, but you can condem them or at least say you dont agree and they dont reflect your views. Its pretty simple. What you want is censorship so you dont hear scary views. Hearing opposing views is good, it helps you maintain or develop your own.
No what I'm for is the appropriate use of a platform, blizzard's tournament is not an appropriate Avenue for politics of any kind
Lol, so what about the Gay rights and other political events Blizzard participate in? Weve already worked out that Blizzard are happy to use their platform for politics.

Are you against them being involved in gay rights activities?
I don't care honestly, it's their platform. If he had permission thatd be one thing, but he didn't
So you are for censorship. got it.
That's not censorship....
Only allowing certain views to be spoken and other views punished?

Hmmm.
It would be, if he didn't agree to the rules and then broke them, it's punishment for breaking a rule, not censorship

I‚Äôm glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family‚Äôs organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
Bring that baby down.
1 day trading down really means nothing. It's still at one of the highest points in the last 6 months and even in the last week the price has been lower.
The stock price drop has nothing to do with the protests.
This means absolutely nothing. The entire market was down today.
This reminds me of when Ea's stock went down slightly for battlefront 2 and everyone rejoiced claiming they destroyed the demon finally, zooming out the little blip was natural and barely scratched them. Don't jump to thinking you're destroying blizzard just yet,i doubt this will hardly be a dent.
It's down 2.3% last I checked now.
Great. Now zoom out to 5 days.
lmao 2% is not even remotely significant
The stock market does this all the time, sadly they‚Äôll recover and this will blow over in a week
Yes, so my all in ATVI puts will bring me tendies
The whole market is down today...
Yep, bought my puts today. I‚Äôm ready for the big catch
Gonna be real, their stock price likely won't move much at all unless a lot of people quit blizzard products, and even then we won't see much effect till  the end of quarter results.

It's best to not trade on emotion because the market probably doesn't feel the same way.
Blizzard is over guys! Soon they'll join the grave alongside EA!
I had about 10 stocks in it, and was waiting to sell till Christmas. Guess Christmas came early this year.
Glad many of the games I play moved away from that company looking at you destiny 2. Hope we make them think about this and to a retcon to their statements
I hope it drops like a fucking rock
F blizzard!! F china
I bought in before Classic. I'm selling tomorrow.
Investors are gone ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
lol i like that it went up a little bit for a second.... then 'nope we're still falling'

I will be protesting at Blizzard HQ in Irvine on 10/10/2019. Please come join me! Thank you! STAND FOR FREEDOM. LIBERATE HONG KONG.
I check this regularly since Diablo Immotal anouncement. Stock dropped by half after that announcement. Then they cut a bunch of staffing. Fake articles continue to say now is the time to buy blizzard. Its hilarious. This should take it to a new low. 

There was also great article from ex employee of blizzard. Talk about how they lay off ful time employees then hires them back with big cuts.
sadly that new modern warfare will probably prop their stock right back up. i doubt most people will even see activision games as part of blizzard when they 100% are
RIP my Activision calls :(
didn't these SCUMBAGS work with south park making that WoW episode? china should ban all their games for working with such an evil cartoon
oopise
Had me in the first half not gonna lie
Time to short swap contracts.
[removed]
 Activision/blizzard is down 30% this year still.
My friends over at r/wallstreetbets tell me to buy puts.
May not seem small, but it‚Äôs a start.
I think the idea isn‚Äôt to sell your stocks, it‚Äôs to make it less attractive for others to buy stock because of lower sales, etc.
Not only that but individual stocks go down with the whole market. Wake me up when they are down 5% on a green day. Also check out this order flow https://imgur.com/PxWBmLR.jpg. Seems to be greater on the buy side even though the stock price is dropping slightly. Not totally certain how this correlates with stock price but it could be that it is being artificially pumped by Chinese sympathisers.
Let them belive that if they boycott companies with China interest they have to boycott almost everything they owe even your mobile phone, TV even your cloth which is made from China. A lot of mobile phones has electronic parts from china. HK protesters orchestrating a hate train and hope that a lot of people jumping in try to move the mass. It's just interesting if you observe the bad China news subs.
You're not wrong, most stock dip this time of year, and most stocks dropped like this today anyways.

You'd have to get far more backlash than this for that shit to really drop, unfortunetly
why are you downvoting this guy?
[deleted]
Profiting from the dismay of the big evil corps babyyyy
Now that you told everybody your plan the stocks are gonna soar.
I'm not sure what you're looking at. YTD they are up. They started the year at 47.03 and the OP has them at 57.13
Why does that matter? Since the news story blew up they are down 2.31%. But the S&P as a whole is down 1.56% so it very easily could just be random noise.
Using /r/wallstreetbets for financial advice is like going to /r/funny for humour
While you're at it, go for some TSLA $420 6/9 Calls
Short the stock
Sorry but what is that app?
Stop gatekeeping. People can start taking positive steps slowly as they learn.
The amount lost is inconsequential (Im fairly close to even) and I want to show my intentions in the best way I can.
I win either way.
I'm looking from Oct to Oct. they were ~$77 oct 2018.
Could be. But every dip starts somewhere we'll have to see how it goes the next few days.
On it. Thanks fam.
I would recommend CD Red Project.
Looks like Webull I think.
Money over morals right?
Go grab your tendies out of the microwave oven spankle
Yes it bombed in early October when Blops4 didn't sell well and the stock was thought to be generally overpriced at that point. It took a further dent after last years Blizzcon and Diablo announcement but it's still performed well and today's blip is just that. It's meaningless in the grand scheme of things.
Then it's not "this year" that's the same time last year, year to year, or year over year.
Edit: my wording was misleading so i removed the first part.


 Its been a bad year for trading. *looks at trump*
The last time reddit got into a frenzy over a video game company there was a post on r/all about how EA was getting killed because the stock was down like three percent. It ended up hitting a new all time high a couple weeks after that. The stock market isn't going to give a shit about this.
Inverse him / her for fistfuls of tendies
Morals are subjective. I have my own. I morally object to this young generations want for a global police state that rules with an iron fist and intervenes in every situation they find morally reprehensible. Just because we have internet now doesn't mean we should be meddling in others affairs. HK will fight for their own freedom just like every other nation does. They are not being executed in mass. Its riots and protests. Just like arab spring, just like Egypt, just like Bolivia, just like Kyrgyzstan. You dont need to scream for intervention every time a country is fighting a civil war
I did
People here don‚Äôt know how or why stocks move or how stocks work. I remember last October the whole market was plunging and /r/gaming just about lost their shit because they were so happy EA stock was falling.
i really just blame last years diablo shit fest.
It hasn‚Äôt been bad YTD, but the swings were wild. You don‚Äôt make money buying in at $30 and selling at $50, you make money trading derivatives on the wild flashes whenever Trump yaps about his stupid trade war. If he gave me a heads up the day before every time he‚Äôd tweet something stupid, I‚Äôd be a fucking millionaire.
What in the fuck are you talking about haha?? Market is close to an all time high. I hate trump, but just saying stupid, completely incorrect things about stuff you obviously don‚Äôt know anything about is moronic.
HK activist try to create a spiral of hate trains and hope people jumping in!
It's just interesting to observe how they orchestrate that.
Omg I love tendies.
If companies are interfering, why shouldn‚Äôt we?

I mean, companies are people, right?
"I morally object to this young generations want for a global police state that rules with an iron fist and intervenes in every situation they find morally reprehensible."

are you being ironic or do you really not see the parallel with china lol
I'm willing to die for what I believe in and you're just a coward. History will show you're on the wrong side.
Yes and that was clearly because reddit said ‚ÄúEA bad‚Äù which is why it is almost bankrupt now right? Because Reddit has said ‚ÄúEA bad‚Äù for years now it must be a worthless company?
> [/r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming) just about lost their shit because they were so happy EA stock was falling.

Are they all teenagers? Do none of them have 401ks or IRAs? I had to stop checking my balances last year because it was so depressing.
But he is the brightest and best ever what do you mean? He reminds us of that at least once a week. 


Also /s incase anyone doesn't realize that
Tf you mean you don't make money buying at 30 and selling at 50?????
You know what, youre right, i worded it really badly. What i meant was in the past year and ytd the market has been very unstable, with wild swings happening every other week. Take a look at the past 100 days of trading and compare it to the past 4 years, and you'll see that ever since trump took office the market can swing over night (usually over a tweet). People have lost a lot of money. Though im guess if you are just putting money into an index fund and not check it. You wont notice it compared to short term traders.
Blizzard isnt interfering you halfwit. What they are doing is shitty and stupid but they are not interfering by penalizing a player for an interview.  Such a sensationalist.
Lol are you? Hop on a plane and head over to hong kong then big guy. Send a pic. 

I'm a coward based on what? The fact that I dont think foreign countries should interfere in a civil war unless it becomes genocidal? 

What side is it you think I'm on? I hope HK is successful and gets their freedom and china gets put in their place. That doesnt mean the world should destroy itself to save them. 

You're not willing to die for shit because you are sitting here typing with me on reddit. Go do something then you little chihuahua

>Are they all teenagers?

Yes
I'm not 100% certain and someone can feel free to correct me, but stocks don't typically move that much overnight. That's going to be time invested. I think he was trying to say daily trades are moreso where it can be made.

I wouldn't mind Activision-Blizzard's higher ups having to be locked in a room with this annoyance

#hijacking your comment to say: If you or anyone you know plans on deleting their account, don't just delete your account! You can request your Data from Blizzard and if they dont follow trhough within 30 days they have to pay hefty fines inside the EU.

Hearthstone player voiced his support for Hong Kong's liberation on a livestream, got his prize money revoked and banned from tournaments for a year.

Livestream hosts (who ducked under their table in an "oh crap" moment after he said it) have also been let go.
Oof. Damning.
One for the extra shame
Dude we shouldn‚Äôt fall to there level. torture is immoral
Wow that's majorly fucked. I hope Blizzard chokes on that chinese dick its sucking.
Big facts
Cruel AND unusual.
Like, it's not just the fact that they banned the player, but they came down so hard they *also punished the streamers*. That's some "shoot the messenger" shit.

You're damn right this won't be over quietly. Fill this subreddit with trash, delete your accounts/uninstall bnet. 

Blizzard died to me when they banned blitzchung.

#MEISUPPORTSHONGKONGPROTESTORS
Any apology will be nothing more than the PR department trying to salvage this. There will be no honesty in it, just angst to lose more stock value.
I doubt their apology will do any good at this point, they need to say something before blizzcon though.
This isn‚Äôt how you use this meme.

But that‚Äôs none of my business.
Blizzard is too busy making these new rules to give attention to the free world‚Äôs wrath:

1. Only #CCP Chinese players may win during tournaments.

2. Non-CCP Chinese players must repeatedly shout ‚ÄúAll Hail China‚Äù during games.

3. Should any Chinese players want anything, other players must willingly give it up to them or face suspension from the game.

4. Players must agree to forfeit privacy since China has the right to ask Blizzard to submit all gamer info in exchange for sweet sweet RMB.

Edit: Extra words
I hope they get nonstop heckled at blizzcon and it's a fucking trainwreck
At this point they pretty much have to say *something*. It's gotten to where now it's just not our outrage, but the outrage of American Senators. I have a feeling whatever they say is just gonna cause round 2 of gamer explosions though. This will not end well.
Good luck dealing with this at Blizzcon, Blizzard.  Whatcha gonna do? Call off the event? Photoshop every umbrella, gas mask, placard, banner, and sloganed tshirt in every photo? Eject anyone carrying such? Hire paid actors or staff to ask Q&A or simply cancel all Q&A? 

Keep hiding, you gutless fucks.  You can't hide forever.
They have already posted a response on Chinese Twitter (weibo). It's an apology, to the Chinese.
How have they not responded yet?

 A PR 101 student could figure this one out.
[removed]
Blizzard already put out a response. To China.

Have you guys learned nothing from the 1000 internet outrages of the past? Of course this Will blow over quietly. The internet has no attention span, will be distracted by the next big story and the apathetic will carry on handing Blizzard their money.
Nice message, but not the right meme.
can't wait for blizzcon.
[imgflip.com](https://imgflip.com) yikes , nice meme though.
I just picture Kermit saying this with a pistol on his lap ü§£ü§£ü§£
It's in their best interests to not respond at all, that is, if they don't intend to fully reverse their decision and apologize.  Without begging for the people's forgiveness, saying anything is just going to further dig a hole they can't get out of.  Honestly what can they even say?  They posted an apology thing to China stating "As always, We will defend the pride and dignity of China at all cost."  You can't really explain that away.  There's no reason to even open a dialogue with people, all they can do is hope it blows over.  

Thing is, this isn't going to blow over.  Blizzcon is in three weeks and people are already planning to protest, both inside and outside.  This is not going away, so just pack your things and get out now before they delete more functionality from their website so you can't cancel things.

They did apologize, "Blizzard's Chinese Weibo wrote:

"We are very angered and disappointed at what happened at the event and do not condone it in any way. We also highly object the spreading of personal political beliefs in this manner...We will always respect and defend the pride of our country."

Oh shit you mean apology to non-Chinese government. Yeah that won't happen.

#Free Hong Kong!
Have to agree with this post. The longer they take to address the issue, the angrier I get. Probably most people feel that way as well.
They knew there would be blow back. They do not care. Chinese market is far more lucrative the Western markets are.
I'm upvoting this post 2 days later, still no word from Blizzard.  This post is aging like fine wine.  

The shit winds are blowing, Blizz.  Delaying only makes them blow harder.
Blizzard are fucked.

Imagine being like 99.9% of the Blizzard employees who had no input in this decision. Within a work week they've gone from top of the world, perhaps even gods of the heavens, to wallowing in filth in the 666th layer of hell and they have NO IDEA how to escape.

LOL... more iced tea for me!
[removed]
I call bullshit.  Remember that billionaire that was in jail for diddling kids and mysteriously died?  Yeah, no one gives a shit anymore.  In 2 weeks Trump will tweet something that offends someone and no one will care about this.
There is no response, nothing they can say will speak louder than their actions. they're well and truly fucked.
They are in classic zugzwang (hat tip to Lodge 49 for the introduction). Anything they do is going to upset someone, and there are now so many people to please (people in Hong Kong, people in the rest of China, the Chinese and American governments, the playerbase, the non-playerbase that knows about this anyway as it's now been in the mainstream media, Chinese and non-Chinese investors, employees, partner companies - and aside from the Chinese government, none of those are monolithic with a single opinion throughout) there is no way to thread that needle. 

 I haven't cancelled my account yet, and am eager to hear what they say, but i have zero faith in a worthwhile response, and anything short of buying out the Chinese investment will ring hollow to me. For now, the silence is deafening.
But it will blow over. That‚Äôs the problem. This is just the latest PR issue for them
The fuse they lit last BlizzCon is about to reach the 100-Gigaton payload.

CAN'T WAIT to see heads roll at Acti-Blizz.
It starting to show how much control blizz has over channels.  
There are Facebook groups that are helping control the message etc.  
Along with the "MOD WHO LEFT AND TOOK THE SUB"  
Makes you wonder who all is on the Blizz Payroll.
Pitter patter let's get at 'er
TikTok.* FTFY.
Well, not like people are waiting with open ears for them.
At this point I would not believe anything blizzard says. Actions speak louder than words. If nothing gets done and all they release is a bunch of words then stop playing these games. When you think about it, YOU spent your money and made their fortune. YOU devoted your life to playing these games. YOU generated with your passion BILLIONS of dollars for this company. Now someone with a decent chunk of cash bought stocks and THEY become the main "voice" of the company? Fucking deplorable. Stop feeding this beast your life energy and switch gears people. Vote with your wallet. Stop spending money on companies that consider you a resource and nothing more.

Good point, horrible meme choice. Downvoted.
Apologies mean nothing without changed behavior
This isn't even the correct usage of the meme, and people will forget, trust me.
No matter what they do now it will be known that they do not stand for human rights and didnt even hesitate to show it and if they change their mind then it just proves that they still dont stand for human rights and it took mass amounts of backlash to even make them reconsider at all.
I woke up this morning to this bad news. Came back home this evening hoping to see a response.

 Very disappointed in them.
Doesn't matter what they will respond with now. It's probably best for them to silently stick to it at this point.
Can't wait to hear the very obvious PR statement from Blizzard with lots of "we apologize", "we are NOT doing this for China, you think we are, but we aren't", "we were only following our rules", "we listen to your feedback", etc.
Is it time for second dinner?
Didn't they already put out a response?

It was a bad one, but still a response. They made their views clear.
Any "apology" by Blizzard that does not mention that they will be reinstating Blitzchung and those two casters and giving him his prize money back can be safely discarded as meaningless corporate PR-speak.
But that‚Äôs none of your business.

Edit: spelling error
Pitter patter lets get at 'er
this is an interesting thread
do you guys not have phones?
What is everyone in uproar about with blizzard?
If you're from europe use this site https://shipyourenemiesgdpr.com/ to have a pre made gdpr request and then mail it to 	DPO@blizzard.com
It feels like the SWBF2 event again in certain ways. Already has politicians attention.
Apologise and piss off the Chinese  
Dont apologise and piss off every free, democratic western nation....  


The ONLY thing they will take into consideration is who contributes more revenue.
Low quality meme



























I agree so heres an upvote
And this is everyone's business.
Blizzard Won‚Äôt Hear You, They Will Placate You. So I Have Asked Fidelity, My 401K, Remove All Investment Into Blizzard / Activision / And Tencent. I hope everyone else does the same.
The fact that they haven't said anything yet screams "we have weak leadership!" A non-response indicates a lack of leadership in both the C suite and the board of directors. 

Activision's current leadership is taking their cues from Nero!

If you own Activision stock make your voice heard at the annual meeting and vote for a new board.
Hey I know. Let's make memes and jump on a "I Hate Blizzard" bandwagon, instead of actually being proactive with human rights organizations.
I call bullshit.  Just a matter of silent time.
I don't care if they make one or not. The fact that they already showed they don't care about human rights on American soil is a fucking joke. Uninstalled all their shit from my computer. Now i can fit more stuff on my SSD.
They put out a response. They apologized.

To China.
I'm just here waiting for the tweets and screenshots about infighting in blizzard hq lul
Ironically, TikTok banned pro-Hong Kong content.
They can fix this with action. Specifically cutting off all financial ties to China and brand themselves as supporters of freedom everywhere and backing it up with support for those movements.
[They did post an official response,](https://old.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfkmp1/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/) an apology to China.
It's bullshit, but it's totally going to blow over.  It's hot right now, but in a month?  Once it's dropped off everybody's various feeds?  It's exactly why Blizzard is staying quiet; they know the gaming community.  The vast majority of it is basically a collective 14 year old who thinks fart jokes and human rights abuses are basically the same; lulz.  The twitter mobs will get bored and move on, Blizzard will keep releasing tedious crap, and the addicts will keep playing (and paying) no matter what.
Fuck blizzard.
Bobby Kotick is in Jeffery Epstein's little black book.
Going down with Trump.
Only comment (besides the bootlicking to china) is this:

In a response to engadge a Blizzard spokesperson said that the company is, ‚Äúassessing the situation for now,‚Äù 

AKA Blizzard is trying to figure out which Corporate BS to choose:  
A) Hope this will all blow over in a week

B) Hope they can put out some US only BS apology

C) Reveal Lucio to be Pan Sexual 

D) Wait for some ass hat to publicly threaten a dev so they can cry Victim

Its already worse, evidently a US college team held up a free hong kong sign last night and they cut the video feeds and cancelled all interviews for the night.  


Its not a one off.
I can hardly wait for the next developer update, it will be a fucking field day for Jeff.
Well there's this... Not sure what it is though

 https://twitter.com/thebencheah/status/1182128750051250176
Actually it will blow over quickly, just like everything in our news cycle these days. Same reason we don‚Äôt see posts about the Amazon anymore.
I wish that was true. They're probably going to just stay completely silent and hope we lose intrest. And honestly, even if they lose their entire market in every other reigon of the globe... They'll still have china. Which is the biggest of all their markets. Hooray for capitalism. :/
But that's none of my business
I feel like ‚Äútick tock mfs‚Äù would have been a perfect close
I think Blizzard just made their overlords angrier with how they handled this lmao
Yo, I heard that Blizzard is selling us out to China so they can harvest our organs, where do I sign up?
Blizzard actually released apology already, for the Chinese government, from their official Weibo account.
Plot Twist: Blizzard villianizes itself to raise awareness for the Hong Kong Protest.

Like Doktor Manhattan in the Watchmen movie.

If this is not the case (most likely) blizzard can go to hell and die
Whenever shit hits the fan with Activision games, they literally just ride it out and ignore it until it goes away. Honestly won‚Äôt surprise me if they just attempt to do that in this situation.
The best apology we could get is Bobby Kotick's resignation, and the resignation(s) of the individual(s) responsible for this mess.
This post is gross. Yeah lets attack blizzard instead of actually Chinese government institutions, seriously folks? Uninstalling hearthstone will make a difference, just for Blizzard, not for China. If you want to do actual damage, why not mass petition, go to the Amnesty international website, they sure could use all this channeled anger to make actual statements!
thats not how the meme works, and this is already blowing over
Lol what are they going to say. 

*Hey guys this isn‚Äôt what it seems, I swear!*
I think they‚Äôve made their stand. They said they would do whatever it takes to protect China. We are the price they paid.
Why are people even wanting a response? Its going to be the standard company PR BS that has no meaning behind it anyway. What they did now is enough, why is everyone so keen for a follow up?
I think this is the wrong use of this meme right?
As my coworkers know, if you ever slight me, I will actively work to make your life a living hell.

I'd like the "Do you not have mobile phones?" guy to make the PR apology.
They've responded with censorship by deleting top posts. Save your content people.
Some would complain if the response was too quick.

But yeah, too long is bad.
This will only get worse for them if they don‚Äôt make a statement.

And if they do give a statement I‚Äôm 100% anything they can possibly say will be them throwing gasoline into the flames. They cannot win.

Grab your pitchforks and popcorn boy because I‚Äôm here for it.
This meme format is not used correctly.

But that's none of my business...
I swear the majority of you will go back to worshipping blizzard again when they make a half assed "sorry" post on twitter.
I support the message.  

I don't support your use of meme.  "It's none of my business" Kermit is the wrong message for something that should be every gamer's business.

Plus, you didn't even do the meme right, man...

Let's make it 10k by BlizzCon.
Sucks Activision had to be part of this. Please issue an apology before Oct 25.
I‚Äôve been a Blizzard fanboy since wasting years of my life playing WoW. 

For me, their reputation has been shattered. The damage they have done to their brand is immense. Once brand loyalty and trust has been lost, it‚Äôs just a matter of time before revenue takes a hit.

This black stain on their brand will become a cancer.
Can't wait for the shitstorm that is Blizzcon 2019, unless they cancel it, that is.
Blizz PLEASE respond and fix this.. a small fine or warning for breaking CoC is fine, what u did was not fine
Now we have the New York Times writing on it, this has gone beyond Reddit and into the press people. Historically this is when companies start to actually care and attempt damage control. 


https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/world/asia/blizzard-hearthstone-hong-kong.html

Also, Rubio isn‚Äôt exactly someone I like but he‚Äôs right on point here:

‚ÄúRecognize what‚Äôs happening here. People who don‚Äôt live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions,‚Äù Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúChina using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally.‚Äù
And i'm fine with that.

I've been waiting for blizzard to be taken down a peg or two.
Devil's advocate here, but why do they have to respond to something that is clearly stated in the ToS?
No1 cares
They put out an apology.

To China.
There are more PC gamers in China than there are people in the entire United States.  I don't think you guys are getting the outcome you're hoping for.
I‚Äôm glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family‚Äôs organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
If people are actually wanting to hurt them, don't delete your account and quit. Just stop spending money. Play the free to play games you already paid for. Just don't spend anything at all on them. Uninstall anything costs money to play.

Why not use up their server resources and get your money's worth out of them? And then some. The more cycles you burn in their data centers without paying them anything, the greater the impact to their bottom line. 

Running game servers is not free. Use that against them if you want to make a greater impact.
Blizz apology drinking game, bottoms up for each of the following

‚ÄúLet us say this: we hear you.‚Äù (nope)

‚ÄúWe need to do better‚Äù (they wont)

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll work harder to make our policies clear to everyone‚Äù (they wont)

‚ÄúWhile we appreciate the conversation that has been taking place‚Äù (they dont)

‚ÄúWe will never forget our core values and mission‚Äù (they already did)

‚ÄúMoving forward...‚Äù (everyone move along, back to business as usual)
I wonder which Overwatch Character they'll try to retcon to gay, trans or non-binary to cover this all up.

They did it in the past, chances are they'll try it again.
Your answer infuriates me, because I know you are right and it makes me realize also how things are not going to change and they will remain this money grabbing greedy entity that won't ever cease to exist. At least as long as the same people remain in charge.
Blizzard DID apologize, but just to China: https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfkmp1/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/
An apology would piss the fuck out of China though, and that's all the matters.

They wouldn't be able to use blizzard as propaganda anymore.
At this point I don't think anything but a full pull-out from China would satisfy anyone.
Any apology will be a condemnation of china, and even if not released in china will doom blizzard there. They can't have two differing messages for different territories.
Safe money on them using the phrase "In the future" or "Moving Forward" without doing ANYTHING to rectify the current situation.
[deleted]
Form response apologies are always transparent.

Might as well lead with "so our lawyers wrote this for us..."
I am thoroughly pissed at Blizzard but this I don‚Äôt buy. I doubt almost anyone feels good about this decision outside of Blizzard Taiwan.

They do have a lot to make up for though, and reversing all the decisions is just a start. What they should do now is provide material assistance to Hong Kong and openly take the right side.
Their stock has barely even dropped
I won‚Äôt accept anything less than a brutally honest apology with them admitting how cowardly they are.
So they either post one and it's viewed as PR bullshit and the outrage brigade marches on or they don't post one at all and the outrage brigade marches on.

Is it any wonder companies don't listen to their fan base when those are the sorts of options presented to them?
Bobby Kotick apologizing ....... yeah that's not going to happen
The stocks are coming down already. They lost (just) 2$ in 2 days. If we keep up the pressure more and more investors will abandon ship and the stocks will fall
Their currently doing the math on how far they can maintain Chinese support while minimizing losses in the US.
Short of them prostrating themselves,  Blitzchung a million bucks, and declaring themselves for HK and opponents of the Chinese state, it's not going to get better.

It's not like some gaming companies where they sell single-player games. Blizzard games are all about the community... it's a big market to milk but you don't declare war on it.
Why apologize when the majority of their consumers are from China? They‚Äôll just try and let it blow over.
If they apologize, reinstate the people involved, and promise to respect American* values, that would let a lot of us who want to go back to classic WoW do so ethically.

\* ^(We can argue about what that means, but you get the idea.)
Apologies mean shit, I want action.
I doubt there will be an apology.

Frankly, Blizzard has very little interest in a western market. They‚Äôre making Diablo Immortal a phone game simply because Chinese people are addicted to them and pour money into micro transactions. That‚Äôs why Blizzard is deep throating China‚Äôs dick.
Did they apologize? I'm seeing tons of pro-Blizzard posts on Weibo and I believe that Blizzard might have something to do with the Chinese propaganda department.

Because state-run media is praising Blizzard for what they did, and criticizing the NBA as a negative example.
This is gonna seriously fuck with Blizzcon. If you think their wont be people silently protesting with shirts or questions etc etc, then i think people will be in for a huge surprise.
[They apologized to China](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfjldg/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/)
Are you the meme gatekeeper?

I'm the meme keymaster.
I see what you did there
I hope so too.
Sending my energy to make this a reality.
Everybody in attendance should have air horns and blast them at random times during every event.
Blizzard is staying silent because they're hoping this will all blow over and gamers will forget about it. Don't let that happen.

Keep their games uninstalled. Keep #BoycottBlizzard trending. Keep the Mei Hong Kong memes coming. *And most importantly, don't let them forget what they've done.*
Which senators?
Do you have a link? Preferably to a translated version?
That was netease, not Blizzard.
Because not responding is the best response. There's literally nothing Blizzard can do or say that would be beneficial to them in the long run. If you condemn your actions then you run the risk of losing your Chinese demographic (a demographic so large that it prevented the WoW movie from being a complete flop). The sad reality is that Blizzard can risk losing a tiny bit of their western audience in the long run.
How would your presser read? Bearing in mind either ccp or western market is going to be alienated no matter what you do since both are actively demanding you take action against the other
Not with that attitude.
No they didn't, that's Netease not Blizzard..
Oh you mean like when EA screwed up so bad with Star wars that actual law makers even in other countries have started making anti loot box laws? That totally blew over.
On the other hand, internet outrage forced Google to pull out of their big project to help China censor the internet. It's been 10 years and still no deal between the two. Google did try to sneak back in quietly with Dragonfly but that, too, got shut down.

So no, real change is possible if enough people stay pissed off and stick to their guns. If it can happen to Google it can sure as shit happen with e-sports.
No no no no, the last twenty seven thousand internet outrages weren't real, this one is different!
100% FALSE.

when blizzard tried to make using their REAL ID system with your literal real first and last name as your account name, everyone flipped out, called blizzard (i did) and demanded they change the policy.

they did, its now entirely optional and changed to "real id *friends*"

they do listen, they do change, but now?  

all i have for blizzard is a loss of confidence.
I only wished it were happening sooner
What should I use next time
I wonder how long it'll be?
Well, I wont be playing any of their games anymore, and I'm somebody, and I dont consider myself anybody special so I think a lot of other somebodys will also do as me, and that's something.
>The subscriptions will come back after the karma farming ends

Mine will never. I already quit 1 game that began bending over backwards to Chinese dick (Path of Exile) and right after doing so it became a total shitfest and I lost all and any interest in playing. Just like I lost all interest in Blizzard's games.

In fact I'm seriously thinking of dropping gaming altogether, seems like there are far more productive ways of spending my time than trying to figure out which game dev doesn't (yet) support a genocidal regime.
fan since the 90's here.

i have 10k matches of sc2.

i dont play anymore.
The billionaire who had Bobby Kotick in his little black book of pedos, in case anyone forgot.
You can't unsubscribe or boycott a secret pedo ring, you can with Blizzard. Look at what Epic put out recently. Blizz's competitors are already circling like vultures to take advantage of this little fracas. The market is speaking.
His name is Epstein, none of us forgot, he's dead.

If you're suggesting blizzard is going to fold up and die then yeah you're right, people will stop caring.

Hong kong has been in the news, even here in America, consistently since the protests started. An American company acting favorably towards China and against a HK protester is not going to disappear.

The frenzy will die down. But people will not have forgot of this, especially by Blizzcon on the 1st.
Yea sure like a bilion dollar company is going to buy out the most important gaming market. Us player base in total of every game is 1/4 of the chinese player base, and there are a lot of people who live and jobs depend on blizzard games in eu and us that are going to keep playing blizzard games, this change nothing and inaction is action, this thing is gonna blow over in 2 monts
> anything short of buying out the Chinese investment will ring hollow to me. For now, the silence is deafening.

The Chinese investment isn't even the important part. It's the revenue they make from China and their expansion into that market. They wanted more growth, China was the place they feel they could get it.
Indeed. And the best option in that situation is just pick a fuckin side. 

If they want to be a Chinese company, godspeed. Let them pack up their offices, move to China and start producing shitty mobile games to make whales addicted. Until the CCP decides to steal all their intellectual property and boot them back to the US on some pretense, while keeping all their equipment and facilities of course.
only if you let it
I'm disappointed too, but I get it.  They're walking on eggshells here.  An insufficient response will just make things worse for them in the West, and any significant mea culpa could destroy their relationship with China.  

Their response will be out "when it's ready", just like old-times Blizzard.
I feel like this is the longest i've seen a company not get out in front of an issue like this. I hope their stock tanks some more and people keep cancelling their accounts.
Yeah, a lot of PR speak and no actual apology, change or restitution for the 3 employees they fucked over. That's a safe bet.
China, unfortunately.

Chinese gamers spend $$$ on MTX like drunken sailors in a whorehouse finally getting shore leave after it was delayed twice and don't give half a shit about the quality of games like the West (or Japan/Korea) does.
Its simple really... They dont know what to fucking do. They cant/wont cut ties with China and bite the hand that feeds them. and they are getting publicly fucked the world over.. I guess they are just going to have to lose one or the other.. Since China is a whopping 14% of their earnings I think we all know where they side.. 

And yes I am a shareholder and I am fucking pissed becaus enot only did I lose money. but it was the worst possible way. By the company I trusted backhanding Democracy and America. Shame on them.
Sadly, we all know that isnt going to happen. I dont know what they are going to do. But it wont be cutting ties with China.. Too much is already invested. Diablo Immortal anyone?
And I tried [posting that to this subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dfm5ow/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/), but for some reason it never showed up in /r/Blizzard/new/
A single corporation is easier to tackle than an entire dictatorship. And it sends a message, Blizzard is made an example of for other companies (or their shareholders) to look at. Damaging Blizzards reputation over this will have a bigger effect than just harming Blizzard. Isolating and weakening China‚Äôs economy will take time, but will do a hell of a lot more than ‚Äòmaking statements‚Äô
Well played
Time will tell, friend
I know I didn't but I wanted a dapper frog sipping some tea so Kermit had to do
If Blizzard is owned by Activision, wouldnt this kind of order had to of come from Activision? Or does Activision let their owned assets do what they please?
Activision already fucked Modern Warfare on their own. They had possibly the best CoD in a decade or more on their hands, and they pissed it away for greed and MTXs.
Oh please, they're not going to cancel it
I wouldn't exactly say it is "clearly stated", I think the rule is extremely broad, and they chose to apply it in this way.  As Mark Kern, the lead dev for vanilla WoW, said: "It‚Äôs one thing to keep politics out of games, which I am still a proponent of doing. It‚Äôs another to unfairly and harshly punish voices that speak out against corruption, against abuses of human rights, and freedom."
Damage control.

Look around, there are countless cancelled subs to WOW for example.
You keep making these broad and sweeping statements, have any sort of actual numbers or stats to back this up? And having more anything doesn't directly translate to more profit.  Not everything in the world is directly proportional.

&#x200B;

Edit: Since you don't seem interested in self educating I'll lend a hand. There is some truth to what you're saying, the industry is certainly MASSIVE in China, and in fact there are more PC gamers there than there are people in the US. But that stat alone doesn't provide a lot of insight into the market there. So lets break it down a little. For reference, China PC game revenue was about 16 billion, which is over half of the 30 billion that the US gaming industry made from all platforms (console, PC, Mobile) combined.

&#x200B;

The gaming market there is very different from the Western market. In Chine, not a lot of Western games see wide spread success with the exception of PUBG. The major markey goliaths are free to play, Chinese developed games i.e. Ring of Alysium, Fantasy Westward Journey and Westward Journey 2, Perfect World, etc. There are 2 main reasons for this, nationalism (China good, everyone else bad), and because in the early 2000's China banned all consoles and console video games, PC games however were not banned. (Not sure what the reasoning was or if it was just oversight of the Chinese government here.) At the time in China computers and computer parts were extremely expensive, and so resource light and free to play titles rose to be the kings of the land.

&#x200B;

Within this genre you also have to acknowledge the success of esports titles in Chine, think League of Legends and Starcraft 2, esports games alone account for 6 billion of the 16 billion dollars of revenue generated by PC gaming in China. Which are both free to play. (Starcraft 2 having gone free to play on 11/14/17, so before the 2018 earning stats were compiled.) Another factor that likely played a large part in the success of these games is that Riot is 100% owned by Tencent and they also have a 5% stake in Blizzard. Tencent is a major gaming giant in China and has an incredible amount of influence over the market there.

&#x200B;

Now that we've covered how different the markets are, lets take a moment to talk about how that relates to Blizzard. To put it bluntly, Blizzard is hardly a gaming giant in that market. During the last revenue report for the company, the US accounted for 55% of the companies profit, while China represented 15%. The US dwarfs China in revenue when it comes to this particular company. With that said, 15% is no small number when you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. So with so much more of their revenue coming from the west why would they risk losing some of that? To put it simply, they gambled and lost, or at least it's looking that way, we can't no for sure until their next revenue call. ( [https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-second-quarter-2019-financial](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-second-quarter-2019-financial) )

&#x200B;

This bit is going to be my interpretation of events, not facts, so grain of salt and all. I think Blizzard took a risk, it's no secret that China is pretty quick to ban sources of entertainment from foreign companies if they find that it doesn't conform to their standards, and Blizzard knew that, and they didn't want that. They knew if they took a hard stance on this China wouldn't crack down on them, likely fully aware that their would be Western backlash, but not enough to account for the potential 15% dip they would see if China blocked them out. At least that's what they believed, but reality may play out differently. The West and specifically the US may be very divided right now, but if there's one thing that can pull everyone together it's the suppression of democracy and human rights, especially when committed by a domestic company.

&#x200B;

I was bored at work and felt like writing a documentary. Don't @ me. (lol at me thinking anyone will read this far.)

&#x200B;

tldr: Blizzard took a calculated risk in an effort to appease Chinese censorship, and might have lost.
LOL

You almost had me for a second there, comrade.
Whales only spend money because of the free to play people, do not play their games
Active monthly users is a huge metric for valuation
By playing a multiplayer game you generate content for other players (yourself as an opponent).

Even if you're only playing single player Diablo or Starcraft if suddenly lots of people stop opening the Blizzard launcher that sends a bigger message than people only playing single player games.
I am not for being destructive towards a business due to potential legal issues that would emerge.

But if I waaaas... file hosting can be pretty expensive as well. Downloading to ram and dumping it could, in theory, cost them some miniscule amount of money. Depending on how load balancing works it might also disrupt their other services hosted out of the same network.

I would not suggest doing this. It is very likely illegal where you live to intentionally disrupt normal operations of a business.
Ill do both.
Quitting the account shows the intent right now and makes it WAY more easy to pull through with it
Having a playerbase to show to their investors and shareholders is going to be more valuable than server costs, so... don't play any of them.
Not only that but you could try to set standards about how cancerous the community is...
This is so on the money it's hysterical. This is like the standard template of very broad meaning words that convey a sense of you reading an apology letter but in fact they never actually apologise or even refer to what they're they're trying to apologise for.
Can I print that to play with my friends ?
"It was not our intention..." - Classic Apology 101
I just find the silence deafening.

They could have said any of the above by now and haven't. 
Why?
The Mark Zukerburg defense does work sometimes *unfortunately*
This won't be much fun, because Blizzard ain't putting out any more statements. It'll be radio silence until who knows when. I don't even think they'll talk about it at Blizzcon
 You trying to kill me here? Oh, well I guess that's only 6 drinks.
RemindMe! 1 week
You forgot synergy and communication.
Hilarious, and 100% accurate
And don't forget "to anyone who was offended, we are very sorry".
Make a bingo card with these on them and we can all play when they finally release their CCP approved apology!
This is brilliant :D
Someone Gold him
This isnt a drinking game, we will be dead

Yo yo yo you got all of it! Well done
Inb4 McCree isn't interested in Ashe because he turned gay.

Inb4 gay robot Bastion or Zenyatta.
They did this in the past?  I don‚Äôt remember that, but it does sound *very* characteristic of Blizzard.  Was that the ‚ÄúSoldier 76 is gay now lol‚Äù meme?  And what were they covering up?
Everyone's a gangster until actual profits are on the line. Then all this socially aware bullshit that corporations try to feed us gets exposed for the mere lipservice it always was.
I believe that's called a Rowling.
It's a fundamental problem with capitalism. Corporations need money to survive, so they will always bow to who the money comes from, whether that's the CCP or outraged consumers. Shifting the field so that supporting human rights is more profitable doesn't make companies fundamentally ethical.

We should make games ourselves, leave the shits behind.
Which explains why theyve been absolutely silent. Anything they say will cause either americans or chinese fans and government to be pissed off. But if they say nothing they will continue to get shat on. A PR nightmare you could legit use as a case study for someones masters thesis.
Englishman here. I cancelled WoW, uninstalled 3 other games; will not buy anything from Blizzard again.
Not just America though. This is EU too. 

I hope the eastern markets not controlled by China are speaking out too.
I'm from Germany
Of course it's a 'financially sound decision'. The reason it is sound is because the West doesn't punish for bad behavior that we don't like, but China absolutely punishes everything they don't like. So in the end they upset the west but nothing happens so they can appease China. 

So, it needs to be made a financially unsound decision. We need to force them to not do business with a country that oppresses its people, that stops free speech, that puts people in concentration camps and harvest their organs, that demands companies that work with them follow its direction. While it is certainly a good thing to boycott these companies ourselves, we need governmental action. These companies entire existence is in the end owed to America and the west enforcing its rules and norms. Multinational companies are basically children who like to think they are adults until dad gets home and starts taking off the belt, and it's about damn time. Yes, it will cause short term harm and the companies will scream the entire time while we're doing this but it's the right decision. China has had a free hand this century as America turned inward and we -- America and the rest of the West -- needs to put her in her place. Our current solutions to try and bring about change in China have only strengthened and emboldened the communist party, which is now literally committing genocide.

These things are all symptoms of serious problems that will require government action. Yes, we can boycott activision-blizzard, or the NBA, or whomever kowtows to China. But that does not address the ultimate problems. We need to be lobbying politicians to really take it to China hard. Forbid companies from doing business in America if they do business in a country that suppresses freedom of speech, for example.
Give it time. Remember that the majority of stockholders are not gamers or plugged in to the gaming community. The news hasn't hit them yet, the *outrage* hasn't hit them yet. Once the story gets around, you'll see that stock plummet, hopefully.
Well now Overwatch is banned in China, so...
Nobody in the US is arguing that it isn't a financially sound decision.  They are arguing that Blizzard made a financially sound decision over the morally correct one.

I think your assumptions on what Americans are thinking are objectively incorrect.
This is about more than america vs china, its core western values of freedom of thought and expression vs repression, authoritarianism and censorship. Everyone, from the people in this comments thread to the CEOs calling the shots has an inescapable moral duty to stand up for our values and stop taking shit from the CCP. Shit on America all you want but you have exactly the same conundrum as us. Better decide where you stand soon.
Awhh poor baby I'm upset
Thry already fucked up.
They killed all good options for this themselves.
Yup.

"gameplay first" my ass
They're not tho: https://www.statista.com/statistics/269665/activison-blizzards-revenue-by-region/
They don't need it to blow over to be honest. If they release a cool game, 99% of consumers will still buy it.
The reinstatement is the key.

Corporate apologies are meaningless, as evidenced by the fact they all use the same tropes.

Tropes and sincerity aren't very compatible
That's the only apology I'd accept, love it.
humanitarian values*
FTFY
Pretty sure the Chinese market is much more enticing to them than their American audience tbh. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they completely avoid the controversy.
> promise to respect American* values

r/ShitAmericansSay
I think you're looking for the term "Liberal Values".
Betraying morality for profit is the most American thing you can do, my guy.
Yeah they apologized for the statements made by the Hearthstone player and they will defend the pride and dignity of China at all costs. So they have stated they support the totalitarian government and are against the people of Hong Kong.
Yeah, this makes me damn excited, I'm so happy that gamers are uniting over a cause like this. HELL YES.
You really think they will let people ask questions this year?
Now kith
Two republicans and one democrat so far. You know its bad when even US politicians are united in telling you how much you suck.

No, because it isn't true. What he's referring to was a post by Netease on Weibo. Blizzard still hasn't said anything.
Step 1: force ceo to step down and fire everyone involved.

Step 2: undo the ban, etc.

Step 3: release public apology, assure everyone that blizzard is proud of its employees who stand for human rights, etc, and that everyone involved in this has been removed. Be careful to not explicitly support Hong Kong, emphasis that blizzard is not a political organization and is compromised of people of many beliefs and ideologies.

Step 4: have a closed door meeting with your chinese investors and suck as many metaphorical dicks as needed. 

Step 5: don‚Äôt worry about the opinions of the chinese general public - their internet is so heavily censored they‚Äôll hear about this anyway.

Step 6: quietly wait for the next outrage to happen when everyone will forget about this whole thing.
Yea, this is by no means easy from a pure business standpoint, although it is easy from a moral standpoint. Arguably, Blizzard is in a rougher position than the NBA.
It's still the official hearthstone account not Netease. Blizzard licenses the game, they surely have control over this.
I can't even remember how long it has been since I last purchased an EA game.  The only exceptions might have been something that came in a humble bundle along the way, but an actual EA game I purchased on its own has to be at least five or more years old now.
Except that EA is doing all right, still trying to introduce greedy mechanics whenever they can. Nestle is doing fine, Facebook is recovering. Net neutrality doesn't look good with the recent court ruling. And this probably will mean nothing by the next week or so.
[imgur.com](https://imgur.com) its free, easy to use, and no stupid watermark. dont support anyone with a watermark. (by spreading their name)
I never would've guessed over 24 hours.  It's hard to imagine no response by close of business Friday (today).  Yet part of me thinks it could be deep into the weekend or early next week until we hear something official.
The gaming community's outrage seems to be more legit than the typical news cycle screecher's.
what did PoE do?
You could just not bring politics into your hobby as well
Because of this scandal?
interesting, got a [source] for that claim?
FYI, Asian revenue was roughly 12% of Blizzard's takings, last call.  If they take a big enough hit to non-Asian revenue through cancellations, they WILL write off that income.
No doubt the Chinese revenue is important to Blizzard, and perhaps of utmost importance. And the Chinese investment may not be THE important part, but i don't think we can dismiss it as AN important part. 

I would not be at all surprised if some of the Asian market infrastructure was being run buy Blizzard's Asian partner companies. How high up the chain did the Blitzchung matter get before a decision was sent back down? Did that verdict come from US executives, well aware of the knots that the NBA had tied itself up in at that very moment, or did the decision come from the partners, also well aware of the NBA situation.

Unfortunately for Blizzard, they find themselves in an untenably imbalanced relationship. While Tencent only owns 10% of the company, that 10% appears to be a controlling interest. While we don't know the behind the scenes, what everyone sees is 'Blizzard' doing what Tencent wants them to do. If Tencent gets what they want in this case, they will keep going until they find the line Blizzard won't cross, and it may well be too late. 

Blizzard cares very much about their relationship with Tencent, because of the potential revenue down the line. They want the money. Tencent doesn't give a flying fuck about Blizzard. And as an unofficial arm of the government they don't care about money, either. They want control. I'm sure Blizzard execs would much rather that China was an open market where the strength (ymmv) of their games was enough to insure market position. I'm sure that they would rather not be partners with Tencent, and would rather keep all that revenue to themselves. But to get the access they played the game, and now they have had their first hint of how that game ends. It won't be the last. Whoever made the Blitzchung decision is definitely handing over notes on how the American University team should be handled. 

Blitzchung was an incident, but by flinching (and at this point Blizzard hasn't just flinched, but curled into a fetal position) Blizzard is opening the floodgates to everyday censorship. China is going to keep asking for more, and will that Chinese revenue ever materialize, or will it always be just over the horizon, always 12% and forecast to go up next year because Tencent decided to push their own game instead? China isn't going to help Blizz or Riot or Epic, they are going to use them. 

So yeah, Blizz wants all that revenue, but to get access to it they had to partner with a company that has completely different goals and would leave Blizzard's corpse in a gutter to prove a point. This may have just become clear to them. 

On an even playing field, maximizing revenue/profit is the 'right' thing for a corporation to do in a capitalist environment. But no playing field is ever truly level, and an ability to navigate that uneven terrain is what separates the good execs from the bad.
They don't have to cut ties, they just need to say something. The NBA was able to make a statement (on their second attempt) that took a stand while still extending a hand to China. I don't see why Blizzard can't do the same thing. 

There was an opinion piece in Bloomberg that argued that the NBA isn't at that much risk in China because it's too popular and the people will circumvent any blocks put in place by the government. I wonder if ot's possible that Blizzard could also be insulated to some extent. Particularly because, unlike the NBA, Blizzard doesn't *need* a physical presence.
[deleted]
Agreed. I hope it hurts them badly.
Blizzard is about 5 percent Chinese, good move.

Try.. i dont know, Tencent, the phone game producer with hundreds of games actively against the Hong Kong movement? Bet you have games they made on your phone!
I still gave an upvote, the message is more important
According to Wikipedia, Blizzard owners Vivendi still maintains control.

>" Around 2006, Kotick reached out to [Jean-Bernard L√©vy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Bernard_L%C3%A9vy), the CEO of the French media conglomerate [Vivendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi). Vivendi at that time had a small games division, [Vivendi Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi_Games), a holding company principally for [Sierra Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment) and [Blizzard Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment). Kotick wanted to get access to Blizzard's [*World of Warcraft*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft), a successful MMO, and suggested a means to acquire this to L√©vy. L√©vy instead offered that he would be willing to merge Vivendi Games with Activision, but only if Vivendi kept majority control of the merged company. According to those close to Kotick, Kotick was concerned about this offer as it would force him to cede control of Activision. However, after talking to Blizzard's CEO [Mike Morhaime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Morhaime), Kotick recognized that Vivendi would be able to give them inroads into the growing video game market in China.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard#cite_note-forbes_kotick-15) "

Note that last line....
Cancel it all? No.

I can see all the Q&A segments being completely cut or cancelled though.
Good, shitstorm it is then.
"Countless".
This is a good point, but does not apply in all cases. For example, if somebody is playing D3 solo, whales are not spending money because of that. There are cases where you can cost them money by using their servers.
Install a boy that only playa tavern brawl with a friend!
Does that metric generate value? Not if the users aren't paying for anything.
Exactly. We‚Äôre in for the classic abuser‚Äôs ‚Äúapology‚Äù of ‚ÄúIm sorry if you found what i did hurtful‚Äù without actually admitting wrongdoing. At most they will apologize for not communicating better about what they were doing to us players ‚Äî also known as ‚Äúits your fucking fault for being too dumb to realize we‚Äôre in the right, now shut up and keep giving us your money‚Äù.

The only thing that blizz can do to fix this imo is undo the ban, undo the firings, give back the prize money and make a REAL apology which explains exactly what theyll be doing to respect freedom of expression for oppressed people who are under threat and fighting for their rights. But of course we arent going to be getting any of that because blizz wants to make shitty yet profitable exploitative skinner-box mobile games for chinese markets.
Btw lets remind ppl that many of the points made here were poibted out from time to time in varius subs...

Its been a long time to listen to the community...

Seems nothing will change
Sure although you may want to add some lines depending on how much you usually drink. 6 guaranteed drinks wont be enough for some.
Genuine fear of reprisal from China if they apologize or back down in any way. 

Internal conflict over whether to side with usa and western markets after all.

Trying to negotiate an out with China behind closed doors or work something out with the player/casters (the latter is somewhat doubtful).

Just general panic/incompetence and terror of making a bad situation worse - which is *always* a possibility.

Take your pick. My vote is a combination of all 4. 

If they are extremely dumb then they are waiting and hoping it will all blow over but honestly not even a company in decline like blizz is that dumb. With blizzcon coming up blizz is in for a total PR shitstorm if they dont appease their ‚Äúcore players‚Äù (westerners).. so we cannot go much longer without a response from blizz unless the company really is on the verge of just totally imploding.

I almost feel sorry for blizzard because the timing just happened to line up in such a way that they have no good move, including doing nothing. They are fucked almost no matter what.
I doubt they'll be able to not talk about it at blizzcon.  I certainly hope that many attendees will be wearing Hong Kong flag shirts under outer shirts and such, ready to reveal at inconvenient times.
Hopefully the majority of Blizzcon attendees don‚Äôt give them the option to be silent about it. I want everyone at Blizzcon to be there for the sole purpose of trolling/protesting. This company needs to be made an example of.

Loool the classic ‚Äúim sorry you were offended (not sorry for what i did)‚Äù
I mean, you're joking but Bastion having a relationship with anyone would be kinda interesting since he can only communicate in "beeps" and "boops".

It could be a nice allegory of a deaf and mute person trying to experience love. But alas, we'll probably never get something well thought out like that from Blizzard.
A Blizzard Employee, Jules Murillo-Cueller to be exact, got racially profiled, treated like a "punching bag", was diagnosed with clinical depression as a result, and apparently considered suicide (with at least one unsuccessful attempt). Shortly after he went public with this, or even at the same day even, Blizzard made the "76 is Gay" announcement.

EDIT: Apparently Murillo went public in *response* to Blizzard Virtue-Signaling, not the other way around. The two events happened.so close to one another, I kinda mixed it up.
Yea it was 76 and it was for the whole Diablo Immortal/"Don't you guys have phones?" fiasco.
Part of me shares your cynicism but the other part is hopeful that the huge reaction from fans shitting on blizzard WILL have an impact and cause them to rethink their behavior and complicity with the CCP. Maybe american consumers can reign in our corporations. It worked with google (at least for a time, we‚Äôll see if they try to resume helping china censor stuff in the future).
Ok I actually Lol'd at this one
Oh but thats where you're wrong they haven't been silent. They made a public apology to china, yes to **china**.
until the next diablo or the next blizzard game? Between you and me... We all know when everybody around you will play the next game from blizzard you will be with the sheeps too...

Gamers doesnt have any principle, except when there is an outrage, and then they forgot about it.
[deleted]
Very well said and entirely correct.
You're going to quickly find out that nothing can be done because the entire planet's manufacturing base has more or less been moved to countries that engage in these sorts of abuses.    Not that I don't agree with you in principle.
Quick follow up questions: How do you feel about workers rights, and also, where was your computer made?

Where do you stand when it comes actually inconveniencing yourself vs just not playing a few specific games?
But that's exactly my point. It's 2 days since the event blew up and if people are already saying "it's too late, there's no coming back from this" why should they even bother? Why expend the effort?

For people that think like that, no amount of good will or trust building from Blizzard is going to work, so why even bother addressing the situation again? People will burn their discs, unsub and then the outrage will shift somewhere else in a week or twos time when some other company does something shitty.
That's because they haven't released a mobile game \[specifically meant to capture the Chinese market\] yet.  \[We'll have to wait and see the impact of CoD (not competing with Fortnite) and Diablo (actually directed at China), but that's not on these numbers.\]

Edit: For everyone trying to take me out of context.
I disagree.  These days there are too many cool games that most people don't have time for them all.  You can have a never-ending supply of good gaming without ever having to touch Blizzard, EA, etc.  Sure, some people will fold if Blizzard puts out the next cool game, but it's becoming easier and easier to stick to your guns, and that means more people will choose to.
I want them to admit their cowardice. No spin. Come out and admit that they sold out their morals for Chinese money and beg for the world‚Äôs forgiveness.
I want more than just a reversal because "we didn't think people would get this upset." There needs to be some form of reparations as well, such as a donation to a relevant charity.
China is not even a 1/5th of their current market. This is entirely because if they go against the CCP they get banned completely. But if they go against human rights they get a boycott but still operate openly.

The only real solution here is US gov sanctions on China. Blizzard and other companies need the US government to flex its muscles against China to even the field.
With even us senators breathing down their neck? If they dont get their ass in gear and address this soon they may get regulated out of China entirely. Wasnt long ago that chinese werent allowed to own stake in US companies. You know you fucked up when even the likes of republican legislators and their fatcat lobbyist handlers in washington are affronted at your unethical behavior
It's well past the point of 'avoiding controversy' if they wanted to avoid controversy they wouldn't have issues an apology to china and essentially told the rest of the world to suck it.
I'm absolutely not.  Way too much baggage implied there no matter how you *want* to try to define that.
Who says they have to "let" anyone. Smuggle in a bullhorn to ask. I'm sure it can be done somehow with enough bribery money to someone watching doors. Thena gain i've never been to a blizzcon so im probably talking out of my ass.
Rerorerorerorerorero
That's Netease, not Blizzard.
They could do that... if it werent blatantly obvious blizz had explicit orders from its chinese partner NetEase to come down hard on the player and casters. They cant undo that without pissing off the CCP but its required to make the ‚Äúapology‚Äù genuine. Catch22
No, it's Netease not Blizzard. You don't gain control over a company just because you license a game to them. Take TERA as an example. Bluehole Studios has no control over what Gameforge, Naver or NHN does. Just like Blizzard has no control over what Netease does.
Sadly that kind of defeatism (while also being wrong and claiming things without any proof) is an epidemic that needs to be cured. Its one of the biggest issues of our generation.
I agree. CCP censors gaining control over the gaming industry directly effects my quality of life, so of course I actually give a shit.
I think that's because theres something immediate that most of us can do in this situation, which is, stop using their services and products, since well, those are just games so we wont lose anything truly important or convenient
Tencent owns 80% of GGG.
It's far easier to do so in hobbies that do not involve such huge sums of money as gaming does.

There are other factors I've considered too and ultimately gaming is just a huge waste of time for absolutely no gain whatsoever. I could start painting and eventually become good enough to earn money from it. The chance that happens with gaming, while it is there, is astronomically low.
yes, exactly
5 seconds of google will do it for you.
Well good luck keeping WoW afloat without the chinese Money 70% of WoW player base is Chinese, and i think your estimation of 12% is wrong but i dont have the exact numbers so it doesnt matter, Blizzard didn't have any other choise, they could have been a little less harsh on the punishment, but in reality it doesnt matter that much, company when push cone to shove they are gonna always chose profit
$.70 is pretty significant.
I am expecting it to dip further.

No I didnt sell therefore I know I technically didnt lose money but I was purchasing from way back at 74 and it has never fully recovered. The last annual report boasted gains from e-sports. Well... considering this is at the center.. I am not so sure. Also with this whole Allegeance to China vs US stuff going one I am not sure how they will rebound... I am in no rush to sell. But I can usually see some kind of path to recovery.. Here.. not so much.
See you‚Äôre still not looking at the big picture. You‚Äôre looking at ways to directly and immediately affect it, this is a longer process. The idea here is make an example of Blizzard because of their actions, it sends the message that no matter the size of the company, there‚Äôll be pushback and hopefully it‚Äôs the starting point of more companies getting torn down because of it. It‚Äôs a mixture of economy and influence, not one or the other. And it‚Äôll be a long ass process
I wasn‚Äôt speaking literally but sure.
Count em then
Make a few dozen f2p accounts on virtual machines?
It...it does make sense...hmmm
If it generates investors it generates value.
Blizz should have just come out with a blanket statement and distance themselves without agreeing or disagreeing with anything

something mundane and boring like

Blizzard prides ourselves with our core values and respect peoples opinions. We are proud that our platforms reach such a broad and diverse audience. With this diverse audience it is important to keep our message related to the games that we play and out of political or other unrelated topics. It is important to remember that we abide by all laws in the countries that we operate in. Happy gaming.

Punishment should have been disqualification from that one specific tournament, not banned from any for a year, and let him keep his winnings.
Well you drink every time you hear each phrase, they'll be uttered more than once I'm sure lol.
[deleted]
Terror and incompetence sounds about right - they are probably taking a look at how the NBA's actions has caused reprisals by China. 

At least their stock price is taking a hit.
I anticipate that there will be plenty of such attempts, but Blizzard isn't changing their stance so they're just going to avoid talking about the issue. I feel they will try their best to deal with the jeering and taunting, and cancel any Q&As to avoid giving any protesters a microphone. 

Still will be a good show though
More like "please I need your money I'll say whatever you want to hear to get it back short of actually admitting to any wrongdoing".
Non-binary too, since you know... he's an AI/robot.

But yeah, assuming Blizzcorp would even dare SUGGEST something like that is thinking too highly of them.
Insultingly lazy, too.  Like, they didn't even make a *new* character that the community could relate to or had some sort of *relevance* or *connection* to LGBT rights.

They just pointed at random to the character lineup and said, "that one there, that one likes dudes.  You're welcome." 

Tokenism at it's finest.
Blizzard's censuring of Blitzchung is contemptible, but this is just pitchfork waving. Jules's entire blogpost was a rebuttal to one of his coworkers accusing him of being sexist towards her (without hearing her side of the story at all), and includes such memorably convincing moments as his wife yelling,  [‚ÄúGTFO inside, can‚Äôt you see you‚Äôre triggering him.‚Äù](https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sqp7gi) because his coworkers were asking him to come inside instead of crying and screaming outside their office building. 

This was all delivered with Jules's advertising for his upcoming book.
What I find funny is that the page where you delete your account was updated yesterday...  
Oh... And you need to show them your Government ID to delete your account...  


Something doesn't smell right.
> Shortly after he went public with this, or even at the same day even, Blizzard made the "76 is Gay" announcement.

I just looked into this, if this source is correct then I think you have the order of events reversed:

https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-01-09-former-blizzard-employee-alleges-racism-and-discrimination-drove-him-to-leave

>Murillo-Cueller finishes by adding his decision to share his story was in part triggered by this week's revelation that Overwatch character Soldier 76 is gay, continuing Blizzard's long-running stance that the multiplayer shooter can be a beacon of diversity.

This makes a little more sense imo.
They'll rethink their stance with the CCP... If it turns out to be more profitable to rethink it.
Link it so I can read it bro
That was in a different territory, and it was for china. I'm not saying don't read it, but you know who it was intended for. Now to not compromise that message, the best damage control message to the west they can send is silence.
Probably gonna get downvoted for this just like you, but here goes:

I suspect a lot of the people on this subreddit posting about how they cancelled WoW or deleted their accounts, even posting "proof" via the message that conveniently says they can still cancel it within the next few days, do just that. Cancel the deletion of their accounts, or resub, right after they've reaped that sweet reddit karma.

I'm not gonna say gamers don't have any principle, because being a gamer doesn't define who you are as a person. However just like any other group of human, people who game have a lot of assholes without principle. Selfish people who crave attention and whore themselves out for karma, not believing in what they post. So maybe a few of the people on here are being truthful about boicotting Blizzard, but I doubt many Blizzard fans will unless it affects them personally.
Project much? My close friends play CoD type games; I play these games because I enjoy them. My pride & principles > my desire to continue playing. I have a deep wallet and absolutely zero loyalty to a developer/publisher. I played the division, and when my friends tried to convince me to play the division 2, I said no. Still haven‚Äôt touched it.
This is the attitude Blizzard is counting on, that gamers will just forget controversy when the next bread and circus combo gets introduced. It's different this time, though. This time, it matters.
Not sure if you are a blind fanboy or even stupid AND blind fanboy.....

Heh, probably both.
Just because you're weak willed doesn't mean the rest of us are. Go be a small little man somewhere else.
For me it's an issue on general terms.

I don't just buy games. I also buy visions and values.

Blizzard started to look for me more like a moneymaker priority instead of gamer fun priority vision when the D3 auction house hit us and blizzard tried to make it work by brute force for way too long.

Since then I have felt less and less represented in my nerdy gamerness and kinship with what blizzard represent in the past.

And so this was just the end of a long decline.

And I don't see how this feeling is connected to any nationality?
Many countries buy and play Blizzard games. Many countries have people who are upset about the decision Blizzard made. This is literally an international situation. I mean Blizzard is in America and everything but there is no nationality tied to people being upset about what they did (unless they‚Äôre Chinese, but even then there‚Äôs probably plenty of people who support HK, just not outwardly)
Oh I know it has, and look at what it has wrought. Which is why there will be screaming the entire time, but it needs to happen.
Quick question for you: why is your participation in these issues revolve around telling people they arent ‚Äúreally‚Äù helping or dont ‚Äúreally‚Äù care about issues? I guess there is always some poisonous mentality pushed by the status quo that everyone who protests is actually just lazy and hypocritical, dont listen to them, theyre just punk kids who need to get jobs and so on. Makes it easy to keep people divided and suspicious of each other and fighting amongst themselves so that everything fizzles out.

Good luck to you, i wont waste my time and energy further trying to convince you of my sincerity. I know who I am and thats good enough for me. Enjoy the rest of your week.
Yea, they lost me, but they had it long coming. This was simply the last straw.

They might be able to salvage some hotheads though.
You mean like Hearthstone? Or Call of Duty Mobile? Or, you know, fucking *Candy Crush*?
Revenue growth 8% in the Americas and 6% in ALL of Asia Pacific (including lucrative markets of Japan and South Korea). China is a drop in the fucking bucket of their revenue, mobile game or no.
They just did. Cod
I bet you Blizzard is setting all sorts of financial records by simply bringing back old world of warcraft. If they release a Diablo game, it will probably make a shit ton too. As long as it isn't a mobile game again.
The US government has nothing to say about how Blizzard responds to an authoritarian government censoring its content around the world. 

Its Blizzards decision to either stay in the Chinese market and allow them police their content globally, or to tell them they aren't willing to play ball that way.
Even Ted Cruz has called out the NBA on this issue. You gotta be pretty far in the wrong for him to be on the right side of criticizing you.
I'm not using liberal in the same sense that it's used in modern American politics. What I'm talking about are the common values that the US was founded on (freedom, democracy, free speech, basically the bill of rights). This is not an uncommon use of the word liberal.
I dunno I just know if I was involved in a something as big as this, and I had a big event coming up that involved Q&A, Id make sure there was no Q&A
r/unexpectedjojo
Who're Activision-Blizzards partner in China. Anything they say, I'd say is on Activision-Blizzard too, especially if they keep their mouth shut still and say nothing themselves.
So you're saying that's not the official hearthstone account? 

edit: Ok more reading does show it's not the official hearthstone account, it's "NetEase's PlayHearthstone", so ok.

Even if that's the case it's not quite so simple, we don't know what kind of contracts were done in terms of what editing / publishing capacities Netease may have in representing hearthstone in an official manner.
Thats honestly an option regarding ANY outrage displayed towards a corporation, celebrity, or even in some cases politicians.

Gamer shut-ins just seem to have more legitimate values.  It's not about the social cred, but about legitimately being pissed at a betrayal.
It sounds like blizzard isn't losing you because of this "scandal" and it's more that you are using this as a reason to make a life change you've already been considering. So you wouldnt really fall into the category of people I'm talking about.
5 seconds of backing up your claims is on you, not on me.

you made the claim, you provide the proof.

this is called: Burden of Proof.
70% of the player base doesn't translate to 70% revenue. The stats are all over the place for you to view because Activision-Blizzard is publicly traded, but https://www.statista.com/statistics/269665/activison-blizzards-revenue-by-region/ should give you a bit of an idea what we're looking at - noting also that Asia-Pacific includes Oceania and other big-spender Asian nations that DGAF what China restricts, eg: Korea & the South East islands.   It varies by game, granted.  Hearthstone, for example, would be hit hard by losing China, as 30% of Hearthstone's revenue comes from there, but hanging on to that at the cost of global income elsewhere dropping from protest boycotting in other - more lucrative - games is a losing proposition.

For as long as they could have their cake and eat it too, being in China was a no-brainer.  But if China's going to put their foot down and make ActiBlizz decide between China and the rest of the world, ActiBlizz is going to choose the rest of the world. ...So long as the rest of the world does actually cancel/stop spending.  

I'm sure there are a lot of number crunchers in Blizz right now trying to figure out how much of a hit to their global reputation they can afford to take before having to write off Chinese money, or vice-versa.

So then again, you make an example of a company who did something like as number 300 in a line, but you only target them? Its silly mate. I apreciate your bigger picture but at the end of the day this does nothing compared to writing to a local politician or actions via amnesty international. This is just one thousand keyboard warriors destroying a company for barely a reason.
Yep. Don't delete unused accounts, instead leave the data on their servers forever. DB and file hosting aren't free.
Might've worked early on. But now I think it'll be too little, too late. Only way that pill goes down now is if they pair it with a Diablo 4 launch, lolz.
Careful dude, we dont want to send anyone to the hospital here
This is nothing. You shouldve seen us when they announced that diablo mobile game.
I dont even think one of those typical weak corporate pr-speak ‚Äúapologies‚Äù is going to cut it at this point - blizzard waited too long and let the player base work themselves into a frenzy. I legit cant wait to see what their next move is. We‚Äôre watching gaming history unfold.
Wouldnt he be be the definition of binary though? As he only thinks in ones and zeroes? Robot humor, am i right?
Something I'll NEVER issue to them.
Forcing you to have a government ID to get instantly removed is a good policy to prevent hackers from being able to delete everything they've ever bought from Blizzard just by gaining access to the account. Waiting 30 days with multiple warnings without one is a good security policy.
i have 3 separate accounts i need to delete, if anyone finds an answer on how to do this WITHOUT SUBMITTING ID, because FUUUUCK that. pls respond
So, basically he called out Blizzard for essentially acting like hypocrites, rather than Blizzard trying to cover it up? Yeah, that makes sense. I'll edit my post accordingly.
Which really puts the obligation on us to continue making life uncomfortable and unprofitable for blizz until they very publicly perform said rethinking.
Here ya go https://i.redd.it/3innty5cmjr31.jpg

Official response from Blizzard's Weibo account.
Yeah, and they're making a hugely political statement on an official Blizzard channel, representing the companies values and politics.

HMMMMM, SOUND FAMILIAR?
Easy to check that. Firstly, I‚Äôve had a reddit account for about a year and I‚Äôve posted once which was critical about the Chinese government; in fact , it‚Äôs a post about why I got banned from the Chinese subreddit (written incredibly badly, as I was about 7 pints into my night). I also have low karma (as far as I can tell), for an account that‚Äôs been around for little more than a year. I assure you that I‚Äôm being sincere.
Im not, but i know a lot of gamers here who say "i will not blah blah blah" are driven by emotion and when the cowards at blizz will release diablo4 or a new game, the same ppl who said that will buy the game anyway.

Same for those who cancelled their sub to wow. Give them a couple of week and they will re sub.
Like I said, I don't disagree with you in principle.  But there's a whole lot of consequences if your iPhone and your Playstation and your shoes and your canned peas are all made by people getting paid 15 usd/hour.
You're telling me it's my moral duty to do something, but refuse to answer a question regarding your moral authority.
None of which are directed at China, COD mobile isn't in those statistics, and isn't Candy Crush purely marketed at American and European women?
I'd wait and see 2019, 2020 numbers.  You're thinking about the past.  Activision is thinking about the future.
Is that popular in China?  Something tells me no.  Also, those numbers are 2007 to 2018.
Its not released in China yet.
Parts of the us govt has already weighed in, so this is false. The usa is not going to sit back forever while our corporations aid repression in china. Regulation will come down the pipes at some point given that both sides of the aisle are united in disdain over this
It's like siding with NAMBLA in a debate around age of consent. There's no possible way you come out as the good guy on that one.
Doesn't matter.  40% of the US population will see that word and instantly hate whatever idea it's *supposed to* represent.
That's not how that works. Tencent are partnered with both Discord and Reddit, so according to your fucked up logic anything Tencent does is Discord and Reddits fault as well.
"Ok, so according to the data we have, Blizzard didn't say anything. But I want to hate on Blizzard right now so I'm just going to pretend that Blizzard controls Neteases Weibo account and blame them over what Netease said."

That's literally what you sound like right now.
Well, I have always tried to act in support of my values, I try to reduce my meat intake more and more, I try to save energy, and stuff like that...but I'm also a gamer shut in, so, I guess I'm supporting your theory lol?
Yes, I know this category of people. The kind who stir up drama yet do not follow through on it at all and just quietly suck up their pride and continue business as usual.

But yes, it's likely I would have made this decision even without this Blitzchung shitshow. Just made it a whole lot easier I guess.
It's not a claim, it's called the news. Do you need a source that Trump is President too? But since you're too lazy, [here you go] (http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=bobby+kotick+epstein+little+black+book). Chillax.
Well this was a good talking thanks to share actualy usefull information, i think you are wrong in one particular step of this analisis, you assume that the rest of the world would cancel every blizzard game from their life, putting aside the people that can't because they made those games their life supporting revenue, there are tons of people who are going to ignore this thing and in the long run is gonna blow over.
That shows a lot of faith in politicians who already know the situation and haven‚Äôt acted
Shit good point, gotta add \*Please drink responsibly\*

Give me a min... I have to make a meme for this comment alone...

Edit: https://imgur.com/BMZN6La
Badum tss.
Just cheat or play with hacks, they eventually will delete your account ?
I cannot delete my account any other way than issuing a gov. photo ID currently. I have no other options on their website.
The thing is, this bit of revenue they lose in the west is nothing compared to the revenue they gain from China. If Actiblizzard has to choose one, they will choose China- And its clear they already have.
Wow. Pretty overt Chinese nationalism there, but a player protesting against the CCP's brutal regime is too political? Very hypocritical.
With that kind of attitude? I just don't believe you. You're weak willed and you have a defeatist attitude, people like you are why things don't change for the better.
Im not going to spend much time convincing anyone that standing up to a totalitarian regime that harvests organs and crushes all dissent is a moral duty. There isnt time to get everyone on board. If you dont see that standing up to repression and organ harvesting and genocide is the right thing to do, I cant do anything for you.
That is the *exact* point of all this: Hearthstone (the game in question here) is directed at Americans, and yet still caters to Chinese censors. It's an example of a broader trend for all media to avoid pissing off China, even if the Chinese aren't the biggest target market. 

This can happen only because people in the rest of the world don't care or aren't aware that it's happening. Companies lose nothing by catering to China because it doesn't hurt their reputation anywhere else, so why not do it? If people *did* care and notice, then the companies might think twice before censoring.

And normally a movement like this doesn't do much, but it comes on the heels of many other high-profile censorship cases (the NBA, South Park) and weeks away from Blizzcon. People are primed to listen and care, and there's a good reason for it to stay in the media for a long time.  These are historically the big things needed for a boycott or protest movement to succeed. Blitzchung probably knew this and was acting strategically.
It's still a mobile game they've released, and King has released numerous other mobile games alongside it.

Call of Duty Mobile just came out and is like the hottest mobile game right now so you just look a *wee* bit misinformed.
The future which will consist of bending over to ccp censors and helping them crush dissent while the west turns its back and even your even your own employees get fed up and start slinging their resumes, apparently.
lol k
They're the only Activision-Blizzard associated entity to give a statement. While Activision-Blizzard sits quietly and lets the whole thing blow over so they can return to business as usual. So until then, it's basically Acti-Blizz's stance. They stand with China and defend China's pride, so they can have a pretty penny out of China's market.
No, that's not what they sound like.

What they said is an objective take on what we can currently observe right now, based on all that we know. Not one word twxxx said has anything to do with what you suggest.

Now, if you want to talk about what people sound like, you on the other hand ...
Keep on keeping on, fellow shut in
No.   
burden of proof is always on the person who makes the claim.  
you cannot shift this to someone else.

"who is the president" is common knowledge.   

"did X person diddle children?" is not common knowledge, so you should provide a source.

especially if someone politely requests it.

you need to chillax and learn that something can be "news" and also not "common knowledge" and also be a reasonable request.

im not lazy, YOU"RE lazy, you made the claim, YOU PROVIDE THE PROOF.

thats how talking to other people works.

your original response was very short, in the same "5 seconds" it took for you to be a snarky dickbag, you could have provided proof, but no, you wanted to be rude and lazy.

thats on you.
> putting aside the people that can't because they made those games their life supporting revenue

They already made the money from making it and aren't making more from us playing it, that money goes to shareholders and CEO's...  Go suck Winnie the Xi's dick elsewhere.
Acting on Blizzard vs doing nothing with politicians because they havent done anything out of themself?

Maybe if you wrote that letter you'd get some actual answers and movement instead of waiting for Blizzards PR department to mess up again, like some kind of game. Doesnt show much support to those being hurt and harmed in Hong Kong that you delete your videogame, but it would show support if you stepped to your local politicians and made a point of it.
[deleted]
Kek
Country?
Im not sure about that though. Seems more like they were trying to dip their fingers in both pies and hoping they would not get forced to choose only one. Now that they have been put on the spot, itll be interesting to see what move they make.
You see, that's why we make the chinese government uncomfortable with working with Blizzard by associating all their works with the things they don't want their people to see.
The defense is "b-but thats not Blizzard its Netease, they control communications in china for Blizz"

Yeah, and they're making a hugely political statement on an official Blizzard channel, representing the companies values and politics.

HMMMMM, SOUND FAMILIAR?
Mfw when the real card game was politics all along
Nice try Cap'n Pedant, but what the OP meant was that they haven't released a mobile game directed at the Chinese market yet.

You know that's what he meant and you still insisted on this nonsense, pointless argument over a point he didn't make because you think that makes you "win" when all it does is make you look like a teenager.
Okay, none of you are following the logic here.  The link (if you clicked it, which I'm guessing you didn't) shows 2007 to 2018.  A bunch of you keep telling me "COD Mobile just came out".  Well, if it "just came out" then it's not in those numbers.  Is it?  And even if it was in those numbers, it's not directed at China.  Is it?  

I'm unfamiliar with King.  Please point me to the pre-2019 mobile games from King that are directed at China.
You know he's right though, China's market only continues to grow and it is much much larger than the western hemisphere combined. Blizzard can give 0 fucks about America's butthurt feelings when they are due to make billions in the coming years.
What we can currently observe right now is that Blizzard upheld their rules of no politics during tournaments. Doesn't matter if the politics are about democracy, revolution, nationalism, communism or whateverism. He would've been banned, DQd and lost all prize money no matter what political view he had. What we can also observe right now is that Netease wrote on THEIR weibo account and Blizzard hasn't said anything other than their announcement that he was DQd and banned. Netease isn't Blizzard.
lol no one is litigating here, you're soapboxing "burden of proof" over a one line comment that takes 5 sec to verify. Looking at your history it's clear you love inventing drama where there is none. Glad I gifted you the most self-satisfying moment of your angry day, lmao!
Ideally, people would do both. But with how society works currently targeting the corporate side rather than the political side will be more consistent, reliable and effective even if it‚Äôs less immediate. ‚ÄúTrust in the system‚Äù is how you end up with a clusterfuck like brexit, it doesn‚Äôt work.
United States.
I would not be shocked if Blizzard headquarters is literally airlifted from California to Beijing
The logic is here: you saying they've never released a mobile game and everybody else showing you that's provably untrue and has been for a long time.

King has made a number of games but their most prominent ones are all the games in the Candy Crush series. Which are also available in China, as they were localized and released by Tencent over 5 years ago.
No it's not, learn to do a google search: https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2180471/how-badly-chinas-economy-doing-look-behind
Or china just takes blizz intellectual property and employees and kick them back out of the country because a local industrialist bribed the ccp to facilitate it, like what happened to GM. Pure short term greed and selling out to communists isnt always a financially sound strategy
you made the claim, you provide the proof, nothing else matters.
Brexit came from independant newspapers lying to people, attacking companies over politics is nonsense if they arent political. And blizzard arent political.
Lmao
[deleted]
Are you being pedantic or just disingenuous?  Clearly, when I said mobile games, I was referring to mobile games directed at China, as that was the subject of conversation.  But I didn't literally say that, so you have me on a technicality.   You're the best.

Candy Crush.  I've said it before, I'll say it again.  Not. Directed. At. China.  In the context of this conversation, Candy Crush doesn't show Activision's attempt to grab a massive chunk of China's mobile game market.  You can't just translate Candy Crush and expect to grab 40% of a market.  This conversation is getting ridiculous.
lol GDP.  One of the worst indicators for how well a country is doing.  That stock market move he mentions isn't really an indication of failure to grow.   It was a bubble.  Much like our own bubble in 2007.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316\_Chinese\_stock\_market\_turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_Chinese_stock_market_turbulence)
Doesn't matter how their economy is doing when they have potentially 20x the playerbase than America does. It's simple math dude, China is a much more lucrative market to game developers than the US.
Zzzzzzz you are the boringest flavor of insufferable. I hope you get well, really I do.
Thats what I'm saying, CHina takes over Blizzard and just moves their HQ to Beijing.
GDP, *and* every other major economic indicator: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49791721

Can't tell if you're actually this dense or just a well-paid communazi troll.
it 100% matters if that playerbase can't afford to buy their games because their economy's tanking.
Deeper pockets in America.
Eh most companies don't have the foresight it would require to dig deep and plant roots in a tightly controlled market like China. China would rather use the US companies to dig those roots in their home countries. Companies can go bankrupt, China isn't going anywhere. The math might be simple, it's predicting how China acts that's the difficult part.

Who ever is going to Blizzcon should totally print hundreds of these and pass them out.
 No one told me he was *handsome*! D:
I don't have a problem with blizzards  supporting China but they shouldn't be trying to impose their feelings on all of their customers. Surely deleting that guy acounts based on his  personal opinions political otherwise must have broken some consumer rights laws. 
And taking his prize money away tells future competitors that if they do win a competition they might get the prize or they might not depending on how blizzard are feeling I suppose pro gamers will still compete for the love of the game but it going to make it harder to convince them to travel to competitions and invest in the hardware thay nead to compet at that level.
Other Friendly Minions Gain **Enrage: -1 Customer**.
Death rattle: Shitstorm. Your opponent can no longer mute emojis.
You forgot his Deathrattle:

*Start a fucking revolution.*
Wasn‚Äôt there an addendum: this effect happens when you win the game.
change it to battlecry: an army of people who support hongkong
You forgot the death affect is to come back strong and louder than he ever would have been if they didn't try to make an example of him.
Except even the rule they used says they can use it at their discretion. Blizzard had the choice. They didn‚Äôt have to do this even by their own rules.
Yeah, this is one of the reasons why I like how the NFL handles issues like these... the nfl takes a hard line in the sand (which is perfectly reasonable) but the fines start off small and gradually increase (first offense is 7k and I think it doubles everytime after that).

This method allows the NFL to try and stay out of divisive topics, but still allowing its players a pretty easy avenue to speak up on whatever topic they want and not get overly punished.  I have no problem with Blizzard not wanting to get involved in such a heated topic... but to effectively take away someones entire salary for the season and then fire two people who didnt even try to ask Blitz to bring up the subject is totally over the line.

I would like to thank blizz though as I was about to preorder the new CoD game and drop some more # on Overwatch for my switch for when I travel... guess that $$$ is going to more beer from my local brewery lol
Is this why Eloise gave up hearthstone?
Instead of overload it just forfeit the coin from all your games.
The online version of Magic the Gathering is really good too.
That's cool and all, but seems a bit PR-y
And most deliciously, that rule exists to protect Blizzard's public reputation.  So if a player said something that caused harm to Blizzard's public reputation, they could penalize them for that. 

The wonderful irony is them using that rule has caused far greater damage to their public reputation than allowing him to express that sentiment ever could have. 

Womp womp.
What you said hits the nail on the head.  This is my stance on it as well.  As a company you need to maintain a level of neutrality.  That's fine.  

If Blizzard wanted to fine him, OK.  I don't *agree*, but if their tourney rules said, "discussion of politics will result in gradually increasing fines," I get it.  That's neutral, they're trying to make it about the game and not immerse themselves in politics.  Fine him a portion of his winnings, makes clear they're not endorsing his sentiment. 

I would even understand it if breaking the rules resulted in something like a tourney winner forfeiting future interviews.  Like, you can still participate, but, you just don't get any TV time.  Still a jerk move, but, I get where they're coming from if they do that.

But that's not what Blizzard did.  Blizzard *expressly* took a stand and they took a stand *with China* and *against* Democracy. 

What I'd love to know is, if a tourney winner said, "my respects to the People's Republic, I am a big fan," would they ban him and take away his money? 

I highly doubt it. 

So Blizzard is making an expressly political statement with what they did, and on precisely the *wrong* side of things.
Beer is better
Look at the guys comment history. It's just spam of the same comment
Well, ignoring it would mean China would block all of Blizzard's games inside China, which is a considerably bigger market than losing some of their western audience. I think Blizzard thought this as an acceptable loss. Especially considering a lot of westerners are weak willed and will just come crawling back sooner or later anyway. As for losing the Chinese market. Once you lose it, you're done, that's one of the benefits of having a centralized totalitarian state.

Disclaimer, I obviously am not on the side of Blizzard, but the direction they chose is understandable when you take the money argument. Emphasis on understandable, and not agreeing.
Check the link as well, its a promo-link.

 While this game might be good, this poster is using this opportunity to get free stuff with his link.
Damn leaches. They're everywhere

Haha haha choose Chinese restaurant.
I love when algorithms get confused, it's funny seeing the neural net trying so hard to figure out what Blizzard is when so many references of politics and china are going their way.
Chinese restaurant it is
I did the same thing reported it as a political group! Haha
Chinese restaurant seems likely as well.... (/s)
I actually just went to their page and suggested new tag as a Political Organisation.
It should be Chinese political party
I just tried to post about the issues in wow classic community and was told no politics is rule 3. I don‚Äôt see this as a political issue I see it as a moral one.
[LMAO didn't expect it to work](https://imgur.com/2QwDmUm)
All of the above.
Me too!
I think puppet would be more suitable.
Google maps have them listed as a "Chinaware Store"
Definitely Chinese restaurant, they have the best egg rolls
Gee can't wait for the next controversy to completely overshadow this one
https://i.redd.it/xb4ixjxe7rr31.jpg
Why not both?
THIS. IS. GOLD!
Is it really greed that makes Blizzard side with China?  I think its Blackmail, otherwise Activision/Blizzard executives are some of the dumbest people on the planet.

As large and attractive the Chinese market is, Activision/Blizzard cannot get paid from the Chinese market without Hong Kong, don't they realize that?  A lack of a stable Hong Kong means Activision/Blizzard can't get paid, millions of people in the street with 5 demands, and CCP is doing everything to make Hong Kong more and more unstable by not fulfilling them.  Are people at the top who made the decision to turn Blizzard against Hong Kong really that blind?

"But the Chinese market!!" Millions of Chinese gamers pay subscription fees, loot boxes, and microtransactions using RMB (which is now at a decade-low), but what use is RMB to Activision/Blizzard? NOTHING! It's monopoly money that continues to be printed to prop up the debt-bomb created by Shadow Banking (look it up along with Ghost Cities). Activision/Blizzard wants USD, and in order to get it every RMB transaction needs to go through Hong Kong banks because China doesn't have international banking infrastructure on its own.  Again, Activision/Blizzard needs Hong Kong more than CCP because Hong Kong pays out the checks and those checks are getting smaller as RMB continues to slip.  There's no alternative to Hong Kong because unlike Gaming IPs century-old international banking relationships are something that cant be copied or faked; Shanghai doesn't come close and Shenzhen isn't an option. Anybody who does business in China is aware of the fact that western companies use Hong Kong's legal status as a buffer-zone to make sure they get paid.  Hong Kong is protesting against the destruction of One Country, Two Systems which is how western companies are able to make money in China.  Activision/Blizzard doesn't even make the majority of their revenue in China, its bone-headed stupidity!

So why is Activision/Blizzard shooting themselves in the foot in every which way possible?  Still silent? For what?  Greed has limits, but pride does not.  People want to believe that money is capable of corrupting all principles, but money can only go so far because there's plenty of other places to make money.  This kind of hard-line stance seems more like a knee-jerk reaction out of fear because there was never a scenario where Activision/Blizzard can make 'more' money by siding with the CCP

I believe Activision/Blizzard employees are being threatened by the CCP through violence and blackmail to do things to destroy the games we love, and they're cowards for succumbing and keeping silent
Did I get shadowbanned?  Can anyone see this?
Why is there no option for both?
I suggested: business: Undertaker
They aren‚Äôt half wrong...
Panda Express
Shit.  I went to see it for myself and accidentally hit, "Report it as permanently closed."  Never did get to see the category options, and Pending Edits is unclickable.
Lu Bu.
Trashbag
Is it too much to ask for both?
Why not both?
lol not to be a jackass, but people like me have been saying this stuff for years and all that‚Äôs happened is we get called conspiracy theorists or racist lmao
I just went on Facebook and suggested an edit to add Chinese restaurant and political organization to the page.
Chinese restaurant because they are serving bullshit
I knew Blizzard was just a subsidiary of PF Chang's.
[deleted]
Peking duck is delicious.

They serve the chinese so you aren't wrong.
Can you see this?
Do they serve Xinnies?
Looks like FB disabled Blizzards edit catagory now
Poor thing is trying its hardest.
Perception really is everything.
On Facebook you can tag business pages as certain categories, and people have been tagging Blizzard's page as a Chinese restaurant or political party.
as another person said in this thread

They serve the chinese so you aren't wrong.
I reported them for violence
Most political issues are moral issues.
Isn't Blizzard's whole argument that the ban WASN'T political?
Literally cannot read that

Needs more jpeg
technically..

(i'm using 'ware' as software)
Doubt it, but possible. Hk has been brewing for a while, and now with lots of mainstream subs catching up and even politicians... Well it'll be interesting to see
Activision leadership has always been hostile to both its employees and its customers. I‚Äôm surprised it took as long as it did to become adopted as part of Blizzard‚Äôs corporate culture. It could be pure cowardice sure, but the way they are behaving given their history makes me feel like they‚Äôre making a show of force. I don‚Äôt think they have any qualms with siding with China because their values are in line. Activision has been bullying their customers for years, and now that their stock market is finally starting to reflect a fed up demographic, they‚Äôre meddling hard into Blizzard which has remained successful because it has been considered off-limits (publicly anyway), and they are dead set on breaking into a market where the population actually CAN‚ÄôT speak up. 

I believe this is why they consider this matter dealt with and that the original statement they made is the only one they intend on making. They have gone way too long without capitulating to public outcry so I suspect they‚Äôre continuing the time-tested Activision strategy of ignoring the issue expecting it to blow over. I‚Äôm personally done making excuses for Blizzard, it‚Äôs not the same company of Morhaime or Metzen *et al*, it‚Äôs just another Activision property. 

Having said that, I definitely feel for the employees who joined believing in the lip service the company parrots about being a force of good. It‚Äôs hard enough to make it in this industry so I can‚Äôt imagine how difficult this must be for them.
Not only is everything you said true in terms of the economy piece, but the irony of blizzard being so political in this situation is mind blowing  (instead of simply saying ‚Äúhey guys, can we not say political things in gaming broadcasts). 

The second this tips over into loss of profits, they will take back everything. Unless they are planing to become an outright Chinese company I‚Äôm not sure how this works out well for them...? 

Ironically this event is making a lot of gamers aware of the CCP vs Hong Kong conflict, which is seriously not helping Blizzards case internationally. In fact, they‚Äôre educating people on an issue so serious‚Äîwhile being complicit within that issue... it‚Äôs just pure ignorant gold really.
They make like $1 billion of revenue off of China. Was a recent thing where a Blizzard employee said 70% of WoW concurrent players are Chinese in a stream, but couldn't give actual numbers besides that, as they were unsure if they were allowed to say.

A corporation isn't gonna just give up $1 billion over a short-term hit to their reputation (which they no doubt see this as). They'll wait it out, keep quiet, keep their heads down and let it blow over and people cool down or forget as the next controversy comes out.

Corporations are always about appeasing Shareholders/Investors. They need exponential growth year after year to keep them happy. And if they lose China, that's a 10-11% drop in revenue they're not gonna get back.

And China is absolutely using it's influence to force these companies to keep quiet, or they'll be banned out of China. It's part of their "Belts and Roads Initiative" to gain economic influence in countries to do stuff like this.
This comment should be at the top.
Hello
if you're shadowbanned it's not redditwide and also not on this sub
You are good.
Doesn't seem like an impossibility.
Human rights are politics. It is the duty of every good person to prevent that from being the case.
Moving from MLG to MSG
hahahahaha this is hilarious
damn savage
But they're wong for doing it.
Algorithm: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why but thousands of people are talking about this Chinese restaurant‚Äù
as another person said in this thread

hahahahaha this is hilarious
Thanks
Thank you for your service
That is not really true though.
All moral issues are political issues.
I started an edit on blizzard‚Äôs facebook page a few days ago, added ¬´¬†chinese restaurant¬†¬ª and ¬´¬†tai chi¬†¬ª to the list. 

Glad to see it‚Äôs actually been appearing on the page and the modification is still in process.
I can't read it because it's in a language I don't speak, but the image looks pretty clear to me!
Indeed, How difficult is it to have on their conscience that the ones facing tear gas, beatings, shootings, and rape are their siblings, friends, and children?

There's a clear right and wrong. It is fear that justifies inaction
Activision/Blizzard does not make $1 billion dollars out of China without HK, go reread my post.  All the money made off of Chinese players might as well be toilet paper because Activision/Blizzard cant pay bonuses or salaries in RMB.  No matter what the rate of chinese playergrowth is, Activision/Blizzard won't make any money when the currency weakens at higher rate, and Chinese wages continue to stagnant while debt increases wont see that trend reverse.


Go look it up, Belt and Road is a fake.  All there is to show for is a bloated bridge project in Kenya that collapsed in a couple years and seaports without logistics.  Why was the bridge in Kenya so expensive to build? Why are Belt and Road projects build in areas without ANY DEMAND? And why are Belt and Road projects only contracted to Chinese construction companies rather than an avenue to build partnerships with foreign nations? Because it is a money laundering operation, not an infrastructure initiative, its a scam.   

Whatever you think you know about Belt and Road are just propaganda videos, those construction sites are either empty or have halted for months (even years) even though $1 trillion dollars ALREADY exchanged hands.  China is short on foreign capital to purchase material to continue those projects, and no amount from debt traps are able to pay for it otherwise.  It was never meant to be completed.  So the most expensive infrastructure initiative in the world, where did the wealth go? All that money printed, where is the wealth?  It is all in oversea accounts like those discovered in 2016 by the Panama Papers, Xi's brother is a great example.  Why else do you think the CCP has been scrambling since? Why else does CCP need HK in 2019 rather wait until 2047?

Just watch the algorithm figure out the only way to stop getting confusing answers is to enslave mankind. I hope you're all happy now.
Oh you..
as another person said in this thread

Edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger!
Interesting, thanks for the insight. However, I'd still maintain that ActiBlizz will keep their mouths shut in order to keep access to the money from Chinese market, no matter how small or diminished it may be. Any amount of money as long as it helps them grow and please investors/shareholders at the end of the year is good enough.

They laid off 800 employees in order to have a short-term gain in order to please investors/shareholders. They'll bend over for China for a dime.
Joe :|
Is there anybody in there?
No you don't. Hong Kongers are being shot by their own police, and you aren't willing to give up video games?

I love it. Well done!
Good!
This is impressive as shit
Blizzard now is my hero
do you a twitter or somewhere i can follow your stuff?
waiting for china to ban OverWatch because of that, it would be so funny
This is awesome, and you should feel awesome
She cant do it at all if she's chinese
Now that Overwatch has been banned in China... use a StarCraft character. Once Starcraft gets banned, use a Warcraft character. 

For the Swarm! For Azeroth!
Bastion for Hong Kong
This is everywhere on Reddit rn
This is so good! Would make a legit sticker on anything really, even just the drawing itself has the flower, you could sell many versions (full, partial, drawing only) online as T-shirts n mugs etc and make some money

She's fighting for her right to freedom of expression and we must too. This is our last chance to prove that we value freedom over money.
Not yet, but soon.
They may not ban overwatch but they may end up disowning mei, which would also be interesting.
Mei is being turned into an icon for the Hong Kong revolution in hopes it will cause Overwatch to be banned in China.
We can only hope.
a-mei-zing!
I could do the template, but i would be unable to sell lol.
Shits like this and the other one would be amazing.  I wish there was a way we could use them raise money for Hong Kong protestors.
Thought this was trash spam but the links the dude provided are legit. Holy fuckin shit.
Banned a hearthstone player for 12 months, revoked his tournament winnings, and fired the casters who did the interview because he spoke in support of Hong Kong.

A punishment of some kind would be reasonable as blizzard doesn‚Äôt want their tournaments to become soapboxes for politics, however this was an extremely heavy handed move clearly done to appease China.
Going back to the British one?  Or something homegrown like an umbrella?
I have no problem with it.
Yes, It was used in a protest
Sadly no :(
Wait, it's banned now?
You can't sell them?
SidAlpha is very good at providing all his sources
Shit like this is why I only play indie games (and also bc my laptop cant handle high budget games)
Not to forget their public apology to China.
I seem to have jumped the gun on this one. It's not banned yet. But the Mei memes have made it to Hong Kong, so it might only be a matter of time. But it is not banned at this moment.
Have you played hollow knight? It‚Äôs a fantastic  game.
Yeah, especially putting out different statements in English and Mandarin (in the latter of which Blizzard said they, an American company, would "always defend the pride of our country").
Aw man, got me excited.
Yeah but my ex gf ruined it for me so I never finished it lol
Good, then you can spend your time playing CrossCode instead.
I'm gonna need a synopsis on that one
Ah it's nice to see another CrossCode player in the wild as it were :D
Short version: It's an action RPG with excellent combat, surprisingly solid platforming for a game with no jump button and a top down perspective, great writing, memorable characters, and a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor. Think the combat of Ys meets the puzzle solving elements of Zelda.

so wtf is going on with hong kong and blizzard? i dont watch the news
Very few HK use reddit so they will not notice this. We should post it on LIIH or the reddit equivalent of Hong Kong and on Facebook
We don't need this support but still thank you. 

Protesters could not represent HK but now they dont allow us to speak out.

If you want to support HK, please support the real Hong Kong people.
Alright, next characters. Atleast one or two from wow. Maybe jaina and thrall?.
Perhaps Jim raynor and kerrigan from starcraft and one archangel from Diablo. 
Maybe?  New skins lets go.
So post it again, until the chinese censors take note of it
That's right
Breathe it out
Didn't know that.  This just makes it even worse.
Do you have a source that's not youtube?
Great idea!
Wow. A real chinese bot.
Bad bot
Do tell, who are the real Hong Kong people?
We get it, you do not want your organs harvested. Stay safe comrade.
Yeah normally I get annoyed by reposts but for once I would be happy if every single post on the front page was this image for a long, long time.
He has his sources in the description
If you call all different opinions are bots. then you have 360 degree difference comparing to China Government.  i thought people can understand the basic but i am wrong just waste time. You protesting guys just doing too over in recent weeks. we are ENOUGH. we want to speak out instead you speak by using our names.
360 degrees would put you back at the beginning.
Would you dare to post in your weibo account 8964 to prove your authenticity my self proclaimed Good Samaritan  Hong Konger?
Start your own instead trying to hijack this one!!!
glad to see you fully understand what i have expressed. and made my day.
What you were looking for is a 180¬∞ turn

360 would put you at thinking the exact same thing as b4. Meaning nothing changed

But really is just hard to understand anything you said, not trying to be rude it's just really rough.
It's broken English but the meaning is there. They are saying that by calling them a bot just for posting their opinion, there is no difference to what the chinese government are doing (360 difference == exactly the same).
Right... there‚Äôs gotta be another term for GCP supporter... hm...

 Visit your bank in person or call them up, and tell them you need to reverse all recent charges and payments to Blizzard. Cite them breaking the contractual obligations related to tournament prize winnings and how you spent this money due to wanting to get involved with E-Sports on a professional level. State that you consider your freedom of speech important and cite the plaque at Blizzard HQ for your thoughts as to why you believed your freedom of speech would not disqualify you from your E-Sports career. Now that you are disqualified, you feel that the sale was made in bad faith, and that you demand the charges to be reversed.

Chargebacks put a bad mark on a company. Enough chargebacks, and they will be forced to pay higher fees when taking credit and debit cards, from less than 3% to upwards of 10-20% per transactions. This would only eventually happen if enough people did this together, citing this incident, however even a few chargebacks are enough to make a company sweat. I feel like we have valid grounds and the banks will in most cases side with the purchaser.

Good luck.
I'm just really hoping for you all to keep up that Boycott when they show off D4 next Blizzcon.
Don't know who he is? Is he a Blizzard worker that supports CCP?
That‚Äôs good meme work right there

Damn, I was trying to think of a way to meme this guy and relate it to this China stuff... Good one.
I'm against this, this guy is just an employee who was put in a difficult position. i don't think we should involve him in this like this
Now, this is an out of season June 4th joke.

Bro you just posted cringe you are going to lose social credit score
I always wondered if gear score was a precursor to social credit.
You think you want freedom of speech, but you don't.
....Still ***very*** punch-able.
Do we know know Wyatt Cheng's actual opinion on this or we assuming everyone in blizzard is in support of the ban? This would be borderline slander if anything and racist for just choosing Wyatt because he had a bad show at blizzcon and that he's Asian.
Blizzard can‚Äôt do anything about chargebacks ‚Äî they deactivate the users playable accounts of those who perform chargebacks via their bank, which is a useless strategy if the people requesting refunds don‚Äôt need or want their accounts and digital purchases anymore.

Obviously if your bank notices you are regularly charging back items, they will know you‚Äôre cheating that system and would investigate the  numerous refunds. But if you do it honorably, the banks have incentives to get your money back ASAP to keep you onboard their ecosystem.

Use this privilege, but don‚Äôt abuse it.
it doesnt sound like a good reason to me get a charge back. Idk, i never asked for a chargeback but i would be surprised if "i dont like how blizzard acted recently" is a reason to get a chargeback.

I alway thought it was more if you didnt get your product you asked for or something like that. I highly doubt a moral reason is a reason to get one.
This is pretty good advice except for chargebacks - they don't really do much.
Does this actually work?
Yeah, don't do this.
A few things. 
1. You can file a dispute for service not rendered or service not as described. 
2. If I remember correctly, you can go back about 90 days and still have chargeback rights. 
3. I can't wait to start seeing Blizzard disputes rolling in at my work.

Blizzcon starts 1st November. They apparently have a lot of stuff to announce. Aside from the normal, new Hots hero, new Overwatch Hero and new Hearthstone expac. They should announce the next Wow expac, along with some details about the final patch of this expac. There might be another Overwatch game, more PVE focused. There's Diablo 4 which will probably be announced too. 

People will instantly forget and be like "The real Blizzard is back" " See they do listen"
[deleted]
From what I remember he was one of the guys answering a Q&A at blizzcon after the reveal of a new diablo game on mobile (of which diablo fans were very dissapointed with). One person questioned if it would be available on PC, to which they said they had no plans to put it on PC. Whole crowd booed, to which he then responded "do you guys not have phones?".
Wyatt Cheng
a guy who work at blizzard and announced diablo immortal on Cellphone at blizzcon

The reaction from the crowd was horrible and the guy said something like "dont you guys have cellphone?" 

It just show how these people are out of touch, the issue wasnt that we didnt have cell phone, the issue itself was because they announce a diablo (which will probably be a money pit) on cellphone.

Diablo Immoral, fixed it for you!
No no, you see instead of being mad at the CEO and marketing teams for following awful profit-orientated PR procedures to maximize profit while minimizing the humanity of both its workers and professional players, we should photoshop more funny China memes.

I honestly wish people got more mad at Blizzard for [laying off a tenth of their employees early this year](https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/12/activision-blizzard-layoffs-800-employees-record-2018/), that was much shittier, and actually affected hundreds of working class lives.
It's not. A good reason is to state that goods and services were not delivered as promised. Source: I work in the payment card industry.
Yes, people do it every day.
It works, it‚Äôs been done, and people will do it. 

Just don‚Äôt abuse the chargeback system, and in situations they will honor the request.
You have no idea what you are talking about.  Banks will honor chargeback requests in many cases simply upon the word of the customer.  I have about 9 years experience in this space.  So don't waste my time with your aggression and insults, okay loser?  Your post history is enough to tell me what type of angry and insecure person you are.  Please just keep it to yourself, and maybe you will learn to leave the cycle of hate you are trapped in.
Some of us will stick to boycotting Blizzard. Not all of us, but I can guarantee that some of us will. If enough of us do, then the movement can keep its traction or even grow. Each and every single one of us is responsible for making that happen however.

I know that personally I'll have no problem finding other games to play with. I've uninstalled the Blizzard launcher and I don't intend on reinstalling it.
It's honestly pathetic how many people aren't willing to stand on their principles these days.
See my other reply to the user "Cornfapper", where I point out that Blizzard in recent years really went for the "easy to impress with shinies" crowd, especially if they are easy to exploit. So without the shadow of a doubt will they make some phat pre-Order bank with whatever shit they announce. 


And people will conviently forget, because is how the systems supports itself. Howeever if there is one thing I learned in over 17 years of consuming Blizzard products is that they definitely do not listen. Not even to the impressionables they try to appease.


Blizzard has real issues with long term planning. Their content policy is like a child in a candy shop. They will casuallize their games, flatten the complexity, push loot boxes and in general go for the quickest strongest cash grabs possible, they will absolutely dig down on the candy in front of them. And then they sit there with a hurting stomach, with people that do not stay in their games unless the next piece of candy is hurled at them cause that is what they conditioned everyone to expect. And that just isn't what leads to a healthy playerbase. Which is how you get to Blizzard Fans that mostly mention their old Blizzard-Love in relations to Nostalgia, cause that is all they have left. A spouse they vaguely remember to have been someone who they loved many years ago.
I mean I must admit I have a super deep seated hatred for D3 (any Version, reaper is still garbo to me) as I played and enjoyed D2 for years, so understandably I moved on to Torchlight, Grim Dawn and Path of Exile. So take that into account when I say that I hope D4 fails super hard, cause that in my opinion is kind of what they deserve for the shit they produce these days. 


Let's be honest, D4 (and I think it will come) is gonna be marketed to the same people that liked D3. Cause: 

a) D3 works so similarly to many of the other current Blizz games, they are not gonna return to integrity 

b) the D3 demographic is either already easy to exploit or has been trained over the years to be easily exploitable (you live with the market you get used to it, it's not actually that different over here in PoE, you just get used to the shitty side of businesses, that is how capitalism survives so well) 

c) It makes sense to cache in the same audience that bought and enjoyed the previous game 

d) There is no chance to compete with the other ARPG audiences in any way, as they cannot beat PoE and Grim Dawn on depth or Torchlight modability and ease of use or any other ARPGs, they can only compete in fast food instant gratification fodder with a casual bias cause that is both - as explained above - easy to exploit and also not sufficiently supported by other ARPGs on the market.

So they'd be stupid not to make D4 kind of like D3, just with new shiny graphics and other features that I'm sure will entice a lot of players. Which is why I hope people will remember Blizzard's shitty moves when D4 rolls around - cause if there is one thing Blizzard is good at, it is creating hype.
Ahhh. I see the joke now. Thanks. 

I thought he was an actual Chinese Citizen that is in support of the CCP that works at Blizzard. Its sad to see Pro-Democracy Chinese people get suppressed by their fellow citizens. But not also suppressed by an American gaming company. Blizzard is trash.
This guy was so into mobile. Like people
Actually wanted a mobile diablo game. Lol. The real reason is China has the biggest smartphone market whereas it doesn‚Äôt really have a console/ PC footprint.
This whole post is a stereotyping him as chinese, since as far as I know, Wyatt hasn't chimed in an opinion on this situation anyways. I support HK, but I don't support shitty memes.
*Chinese origin,  happy snowflake
I have experienced chargebacks for hundreds of dollars when the product was delivered with a signature and tracking number.  In most cases the request is honored without anything else needing to be said, aside from "The associated company failed to follow through as per the terms and conditions, and/or engaged in deceptive or malicious practices".    


If you are involved in politics, and purchased the games so you could also become a professional gamer, but now are unable to participate due to your political involvement, you very well are deserving of a chargeback, especially when the company itself has stated that "Every voice matters", which can easily be interpreted as the ability to express oneself.    


You purchased a product from a company that is now banning people for behavior that otherwise was presented as acceptable.  That is ALL you have to say.
so what you are saying is 

1. Go on Blizzard Platform like World of Warcaft and Get banned for Supporting Hong Kong

2. Go to bank and Cite that your subscription is not being deleveired as promised because you were banned in bad faith

3. Profit???
I just don‚Äôt believe that you can legally take all the money you have spent over years from blizzard. With no legal problems
Ok sorry. Ignore my decade of experience. Go with your gut. You utter womble.
Your defiance remains important.
no shit he was into it. you don't go on stage to present a new product and not act like you're really into it.
East Asian origins is ample enough (even though that would be again misleading considering Indians and arabs do come under asian)

Can't be too politically correct nowadays, i wish we could get over talking about race thing and judge people on their character and ethics
what if my last purchase was a year and a half ago? would that be too long of a timeframe?
Well you don‚Äôt profit, but you do make Blizzard horrifically suffer for what they‚Äôve done
Uh... no.
Over the years no, recently (past few months) yes
These are digital products, the bank, or even paypal really doesn't care that much. They'll initially always side with the consumer against the shop. Don't do this for actual merch though. That case isn't made as easily.
Well, the thing is, *you* aren't doing it, the bank is.  If the bank is really willing to do a charge back because "The company I bought from did a political thing I don't like", that's on them. 

But if you lie and make up a bunch of shit about the game not working because you know they aren't going to do a chargeback over political stuff, then that's fraud.
You basically file a complaint, tell the bank your reasons, and they decide what to do.  Nine times out of ten they simply side with the consumer.  Simple as that.  As long as you do not present false information, you are fine.
You have a decade of experience, and you don‚Äôt know how chargebacks work? You‚Äôve got more experience sucking blizzards balls by the sound of it lol, good luck defending their honor while people get refunds. 

Blizzard can‚Äôt do anything about chargebacks ‚Äî they deactivate the users playable accounts of those who perform chargebacks via their bank, which is a useless strategy if the people requesting refunds don‚Äôt need or want their accounts and digital purchases anymore. 

Obviously if your bank notices you are regularly charging back items, they will know you‚Äôre cheating that system and would investigate the  numerous refunds. But if you do it honorably, the banks have incentives to get your money back ASAP to keep you onboard their ecosystem. 

What exactly do you have 10 years of experience in...? Sounds like you don‚Äôt even leave your house man
Thanks for echoing what I was saying lol
up to your bank
Sooooooo, profiting then
anytime chief

Something something inclusivity blah blah blah
Doublespeak
Yeah fuck blizzard I'm done with their games
It was a nice run Activision
Done with Blizzard, BEEN DONE with Activision. I'm so ashamed of these decisions.

Blizzard: "Of course you are free to express your individual thoughts and opinions.......*IN HELL"*
"As long as those opinions make us money!"
I'm conflicted if I'm still buying modern warfare honestly.
...If he's still able after we're done with him.
I'm still confused. Every big company kowtows to China. Why should Blizzard be any different? 

If you're going to boycott them then you might as well boycott Apple and a ton of other companies for doing similar things in different mediums.
only when corrupting western kids. makes you wonder who was paying blizzard when trash like that is forced in to games ü§î
Tracer is a lesbian.
I can't figure out how to play this freakin game. The client doesn't let me login despite my credentials being absolutely correct. The block chain nonsense makes no sense to me either. Idk if I'm just old or stupid
Seriously? Where can I see this?
Eh not really. Sometimes it‚Äôs more effective to target 1 or 2 companies and really, really make them hurt to make and example and send a message to all the other companies.
Producing in a country and outright saying ‚Äúyeah fuck human rights gimme MONEY‚Äù are two very different things
Man what?
Not in the chinese version of Overwatch lol
 [https://twitter.com/GodsUnchained/status/1181487505180258304](https://twitter.com/GodsUnchained/status/1181487505180258304)
I'm OK with that actually. The way I see it is every business above a certain threshold starts to believe they are invincible. It's good to knock them down.
'Producing in a country' sounds so innocent. How about 'moved production to a country with known human rights issues, and turning a blind eye to said worker abuse, while knowing this would result in wealth being taken from the American people and sent to China, all in the name of literally making more money than they know what to do with.'
When did they say that?
Huh. Might join then
I can‚Äôt be asked to explain everything wrong with what you‚Äôre saying. It‚Äôs simple economics, they are a business looking to make money so they produce in a country with low wages due to a surplus of workers. So yes ‚Äúsounds innocent‚Äù is correct, as the company is not the ones who are corrupt, they are just acting as a company should.
> they are a business looking to make money

No matter the consequences. That's the problem. Even big business CEO's are starting to write articles in Forbes along the lines of 'Maybe this whole philosophy of profit before everything else wasn't a good idea. We're ruining everything.'.

Well,  you must have translated "free Honkong" with Google translator. The right translation should be Ëß£ÊîæÈ¶ôÊ∏ØÔºåËá™Áî±in Chinese means freedom,  it's a noun.  Ëß£Êîæ is the correct verb.
Free the Uyghur people in China while we‚Äôre at it.

I missed the moment when Blizzard became responsible for Hong Kong
I think guys,  who drag politics here should be permanently banned
Many of us creating these image have been using google for translations. It's very inaccurate unfortunately. It would be very useful for those that make these images to have maybe a list of phrases in English, with their proper Chinese translations so we can copy them directly.
Plus, they use Traditional in Hong Kong.
The above is correct. Having said that the specific  wording for the same slogan in HK is  ÂÖâÂæ©È¶ôÊ∏Ø , ÂÖâÂæ© Ôºàgwong fuk) roughly means liberate but also carries connotations of reclaiming fallen/invaded territory. 

Ëá™Áî±ÔºåËß£ÊîæÔºåÂÖâÂæ© are all similar words for the same concept. But local HK would never use Ëß£Êîæ (gaifong) (exact translation of liberate)  because of association to the CPC (people's liberation army / Ëß£ÊîæËªç)

Slowly but surely people are catching on to the fact that China is our 1940's Germany.
Red is color of luck and prosperity for people of chinese descent. Just because the Communist party took it from us doesn't means we gonna let them have it for themselves.
It's also the color of Hong Kong's flag.
Dude, colours don't matter. It is us who give them meaning.
I don't mind :)
They don't have to be responsible, but they also don't have to actively support suppression of freedom of speech, and less human rights. This is a free market and the market has decided it doesn't want a media company that puts the beliefs of a foreign country over its own.
We're not calling on Blizzard to free Hong Kong. We're simply asking them to do what is right and they didn't even do that.
I missed the moment people tried to cover up Blizzard toeing the Communist Party Line too but hey, we can't all be perfect.
It's not just about freedom of Hong Kong. This is our last chance to prove we value freedom - of speech, of expression - over money.
China forced them into this mess by telling them to suppress free speech.

They then chose Chinese money over human lives.

Now we are upset.
its disingenous to boil this down to "politics"

There are not two equally arguable sides here 

The people of hong kong are literally fighting for their fundmental human rights , there is no counter argument or valid political reason to be *against* that 

you ass
Protesting is supposed to get in your way, and stop you from easily ignoring them.

They are fighting for their lives. Sorry that gets in the way of your fun.
So you support the Chinese government?
And this, kiddos, is what chinese propaganda looks like.
We still appreciate it :) This is actually kinda cute. I will try to make a list and post it in r/HongKong

Edit: [The list is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dg1lc2/a_vocabulary_list_for_mememaking_since_people/)
Hey thats exactly how china creates stuff with English text. Maybe they'll get a taste of their own medicine.
And the Falun Gong
Whatever it takes
Same with swastika
Because of the government, which is still against the people. The fight for Hong Kong is not for Hong Kong, it's for it's people. It shouldn't even stop at Hong Kong, it should be for all people in China.
Most people I've talked to who are involved say to use the black and white flag. The red one is used by both sides, but the black one sends a clear message.
I wish it was, but again, if they really didn't, people in Hong Kong would probably be wearing red instead of black. As I told before (probably not commenting you xD idk), this is a minor thing, the message is what is important. I just find odd to use the colour of the government as the color for this fight. 

For example, people were painting the blizzard logo in red to make it closer to the government colours, to make them seem more as the bad guys. But now we're using the same colour for freedom? Doesn't add up much to me at least xD but again, just a minor thing, the point is to protest against this behavior of the government and the decisions made by Blizzard, not the colour.
I just don‚Äôt understand why it was necessary to introduce politics into the game. You can come to the pancake-eating competition and shout political slogans there, but this event is not for this. The player violated the rules of the platform, and now blizzard is to blame.
>I missed the moment people tried to cover up Blizzard toeing the Communist Party Line too but hey, we can't all be perfect.

You have problems with the cold war
What kind of freedom are we talking about? People downvote me because my point of view does not coincide with theirs. There has never been real freedom. Democracy is the power of the majority.
> their fundmental human rights

to destroy private property?! Man, go home, please
> Protesting is supposed to

no any protesting there. Don't use the "protesting" word for mass crimes.
you said it in such a way as if I support Hitler. I think you're totally inadequate in this matter
It's very interesting - when the opinion of normal intelligent man, who respects the law is the same as the opinion of Chinese propaganda. But maybe you, guys, are just crazy? Or you support criminals... Respect to Blizzard and Chinese propaganda too, it seems this propaganda teaches us to good things.
And my AXE!
And yet you can‚Äôt use it without people losing their minds
You're right, I didn't know the flag was different before it went back to China. Looking back, it's always been occupied by some country or another.
That does sound like a better choice.
Black is also a color often used by ISIS, is it not?
> Blizzard is claiming that Chung has broken one of their player agreements by, "Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard's sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute."


I read that in an article earlier today. Even without criticizing the incredibly vague wording of their "rule," they could have just given the guy a slap on the wrist for making a political statement. Instead, in their zeal to punish him, they inadvertently made a huge political statement themselves. They put themselves in the spotlight. They did this to themselves.


Edit: reworded some things
They made the call to become political with their overreaching punishment of Blitzchung and the casters, followed by their bullshit stance and following actions. They had several less overly punitive options and chose to wildly swing the ban hammer to appease China. That's political.

Politics influence everything. If you really believe that companies like Blizzard can just "not bring politics into my games, bro, its just video games" then you're naive.
I mean, he literally said "freedom of expression." You can express an opinion in the States without being beaten in the street. You can also visit this webpage without having to use a VPN to bypass a nationwide firewall. You can play video games without affecting an imaginary social score that the government tracks. You can even choose whether to participate in democracy, or just be a hermit.


There are so many ways that China restricts freedom. This is about way more than a game tournament.
You're on the wrong side of this.
>private property
>china



Pick one moron
LOL! Oh man, someone is getting a paycheck. 

>no any protesting there

That is not the right way to say that. You need a better translation app, it is giving you away.
You don't get to be the victim when you are the one doing the expanding.
Are you suggesting that the request for human rights is a crime? Or am I not reading this correctly?
>as if I support Hitler

More like Stalin, comrade.
Didn't answer the question, are you scared to say yes?
I really hope you're not a native English speaker because your English is trash.
'Support criminals'

?????
It has come to our attention that you seem to be expressing *opinions*. Please refrain from thinking, expressing or in any other way entertain personal *opinions*, as they are to remain exclusive to the Party.

If you hear, read or in any way suspect an individual to have *opinions*, please inform the Party and cease interaction with them.

Thank you for your cooperation.
Yeah, pretty sad
Because *a whole color* is not as easily co-opted as a symbol plastered on the flags and uniforms of the best-known mass-murderers in history.
Yeah, protected from China itself. Now that's back to China is that these things are happening. But the people outside of Hong Kong, they're under that mad government for too long.
Time to hoist the black flag and...well, you know the rest.
Not in this context though so that's not relevant.
As I said in my comment, colours involved in *this* fight. Is ISIS involved in here? No. If this was a protest against ISIS, I would say for people to wear white as it is also often related to the meaning of peace. But this is not a fight against ISIS, is against the China government, or did I not get things right?
Oof, looks like that article didn't take the entire quote then.

Blizzard then went on to say

Edit : Don't quite understand why I got downvoted, I'm just literally posting the quote in its entirety and posting a link the Blizzards post about it.
We are not entitled to take appropriation of their fight in this way, though. We shouldn‚Äôt misuse their language by typing our statements on google translator nor misuse the color scheme that represents what they fight against.

I‚Äôm all about supporting Hong Kong, but let‚Äôs do it correctly. Because the way people here are doing it is just backfiring on them because of their low effort to get on their moral high horse, or worse, farm karma.

People that had nothing to do with this decision will be probably left on the streets, as this decision was made by either one person really high up or a board meeting that absolutely has nothing to do with the developing of games.
But it was not Blizzard that brought politics to the game. The player brought politics to the game. Why did he do this if I just want to play good games from those who make them and do not politicize them.
The fact that Blizzard thus distances himself and defends himself from politics in games does not make them bad. The fact that this did not coincide with your position is another question. This is pure bullying.
arguments are over. It's time to move on to a discussion of grammar :)
Anyway, I began to respect Blizzard, a good position.
so Hitler is fine for you, comrade? Only Stalin is not lol

Man, if you hate now Blizzard so much, just uninstall Blizzards games and that's all. Don't write all this shit in the Blizzards subreddit, be more intelligent, comrade?
yes, what is the problem?! sure
you know, the big bad criminal who get 3 years in jail for burning a chinese flag for protesting
dude, what is your IQ?
Neither did the casters but they got banned too
I began to recognize a shill, a bad position.

What's the argument? That protesting by the vast majority of a people is criminal because the autocratic rulers don't care about their freedom? 

It is painfully obvious want is happening. Hong Kong wants freedom, China does not care what Hong Kong wants. China will rule with an iron fist as they have for decades.
Hmm, if you don't see the problem, you are the problem.
Oh no, what horrible person would fight for their human rights.
Have you seen the video? The casters were well aware of what was going to happen. They hid behind their monitors.  


Sure, it was partially as a joke, but they encouraged him to say it.
>majority of a people

let's stop here. They are not majority. And you know it very good. Stop to lie in so primitive way.

They are criminals because they committed crimes (destroyed private and public property, they attacked the other civilians, cops, etc). Man , are you a criminal, ah?! If yes, then I have not more questions.

Btw, why can't China rule own people in more preferable way? After all, no one imposes sanctions against the United States for executing people in gas chambers, right?
Mahatma Gandhi?
>They are not majority.

Oh! Really?

I guess you have a super easy solution to this whole thing then.

You say q majority of Hong Kong residents don't want freedom from China. Then just run a vote then.

Since they are not a majority, it will be easy win and solid proof.

Problem solved. I'll be looking for the results.
Keep drinking the cool aid, it‚Äôs pathetic.
> Oh! Really?

yes, sure. The city is alive, there are drivers, police (which have rights too, not only criminals rioters), doctors, lawyers, office workers, bakers, sellers, different staff and secret services even and many-many other people. Rioters are about 300-500 thousands. Do you really think that the majority is rebelling? Then the city would starve to death. You are probably infantile and romantic "democratic" child, better go to play PC games LOL
Lol, get back from a reeducation camp? That why it took so long to respond?

How about responding to the main idea. If it is a tiny fraction of people who are against China's control, then run a fair election.

I bet all of those "doctors, lawyers, office workers, bakers, sellers, different staff and secret services even" are sure tired of the 'infentile pro-democracy' protesters. Let them shoe their dissatisfaction with a vote.

Once the protesters get obliterated by the very thing they are fighting for, they would totally lose hope and give up.

Why not let the people vote?
yes, I was in the camp. Shitty Communists returned me freedom with the condition that I should continue to troll you lol
Then your freedom relies on my continued replies! Don't worry! I will feed the troll long into the night!

Sooo... About ignoring the election question twice in a row. Ever not going to ignore that question?

Democracy: The HKers now have more democracy than the colonial era, where governors during the era were appointed by the British government, and I believe all the governors were British. Now they can pick from candidates selected by China.  


Freedom: Look at the link I have linked above.
I stand with Mei! I stand with Hong Kong! I stand against Blizzard! We all do! Liberate Hong Kong! You cannot silence us!
Democracy is always worth fighting for whether Hong Kong or not
OOOOH RAHH
HK Mei doesn't have both eyes.
And she was never heard from again.
Easy karma? Easy karma
Sorry, no way I can bring myself to support this

Blizzard doesn't though
Quick, does anyone know if imgur have Chinese ties?
The person who posted that deleted it himself/herself. Reddit didn't remove it. I'll link the original post in a second https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dg2hat/this_picture_showing_the_chinese_flag_with_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

No one cares. That's not what this post was about lol

ROFL.  Spot on, well done!
i wouldn't be surprised if activision is saying "this isn't official, it's just HK terrorist doing this".
I hadn't seen that so im not sure.

Finally some smart people in here!
We're trying to get Blizzards games banned in China. Starting with overwatch
Thats the point!

I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm confused, I never said any of this wasn‚Äôt important
To be fair, that is correct. Blizzard and the voice actress behind the character are both opposed to this. And Mei as a character is from a completely different part of the country, farther from Hong Kong than Miami is from New York.

It's a minor form of it sure, but it's not really any different from Isis taking a vaguely middle-eastern character and using it for propaganda.
[Oof](http://imgur.com/a/8P039Ws)
Give me a sec. I'll look it up.
I expect this comment to be downvoted to oblivion just like what happened to all my comments with any of these links followed by the usual accusation of being some paid Chinese internet censor(I'm not fromChina BTW I'm from Singapore)

I'm beginning to think the only reason why anyone is still supporting the riots is because no one knows about the riots. Only news censoring police actions out of context to make them look bad seem to be getting through

This riots made me loss all confidence in western media, they are no better than Chinese propaganda
Oh hell fuckin yes.
Hmmm interesting. I'm not familiar with the website you linked but if it's right, it's even more fucked up that the mods would delete it and then make a reply saying the person did it themselves. Like at least have some self respect and let it be ambiguous.
I don‚Äôt think they understood my intention with the post
I didn‚Äôt wanna be THAT person to point shit out, thank you stranger lol
"She is a game character.  She stands for science and climate change in the game from what i understand. What she stands for in the game has nothing to do with the movement. the residents of China and Hong Kong that play overwatch like Mei as she is a chinese character."

"Well Mei is really a popular representation of the chinese people and is simply being used as a way to backfire on blizzard anyways.  The beliefs of the woman that voices her character in the game is irrelevant to this situation.  Though i believe something should be said that the voice actress has not received any backlash from Blizzard (that i know of) from her support of China."

Sorry im not reddit savvy and i was also too lazy to retype it all lol but i believe this could help explain the use of Mei a bit better.  She is a symbol for Hong Kong and whatever her game background is irrelevant.  Her voice actors opinion should have no bearing on the situation either.
Gotcha.  Well Mei is really a popar representation of the chinese people and is simply being used as a way to backfire on blizzard anyways.  The beliefs of the woman that voices her character in the game is irrelevant to this situation.  Though i believe something should be said that the voice actress has not received any backlash from Blizzard (that i know of) from her support of China.
yuck
I agree except for one point: China is REALLY bad at propaganda. I think they either don't care about winning the international propaganda war or they think it's a waste of money.
That‚Äôs why people are even more upset. Just letting things be would have been a better move
Yeah lol it was too clever! Read downwards!
I dont think the VA will unless she uses the blizzard network (stream or official social media accounts), so long as she does it on her stuff, she'll be safe.
That makes sense, it just seemed weird to me because I thought there was some canon about Mei being a protester. Didn't realize it was just using Blizzard's own character against them.


**Edit:** I'm fully in support of HK. I just misunderstood this one.
It's really weird y'all wanna use her likeness to say something completely opposite of what she believes in.
I think they know the western media hegemony is too effective where they already reach, so yeah probably they think it's a waste of money.
I‚Äôve had way too many comments taken down lol had to get around them somehow
All good.  Theres a lot of misinformation out there!
She is a game character.  She stands for science and climate change in the game from what i understand. What she stands for in the game has nothing to do with the movement. the residents of China and Hong Kong that play overwatch like Mei though as she is a chinese character.
The voice actor has no morals. The character she plays does

Just cancelled my WoW subscription. Just came back to the game after a couple years.
I'm a long-time Blizzard fan and will be joining the boycott. It's a shame because I was enjoying classic WoW but, unlike Blizzard, I actually value freedom and don't think the CCP should be controlling our speech.
Boycotting Blizzard after decades playing their games.  They have made clear their intention to become a corporate censor for the PRC.  They are an enemy of free speech.
Not a golden legendary, should have been a turd hued common
 I wanted to unwind and play some OW after work last night, instead, I uninstalled the game.  Nice work Blizzard, some things are more important than protecting profits.
You need to add Activision to the front of this as well

oh and Apple too
I just got an update on my "Data Protection Request" to have my account and information deleted. For those that don't know they will automatically fail your attempts at using SMS Text or the Authenticator verification to submit leaving you with the only option of uploading your ID. I did so but redacted my DL # and other information not used in creating my account, so they had my name, address, photo of my ID...DENIED. Claimed it was illegible which is BS
Btw guys don't forget to boycott Activision products too, since they're merged with Blizz.
Would you happen to have any hunny?

I feel a bit dumb not getting this one
It's Laogai, not gulag in this case.

Why should an American based company bow and fear what they say about another country?
Oh...you must know...Money is king, anyway i removed my account.
The company didn't say shit about another country though. The player used their platform to push a viewpoint that yes i agree with but it was not the place for it. He knew the repercussions of his actions and he knew he would be putting blizzard in a bad spot. 

All blizzard did was enforce their own rules and people went apeshit.

If someone in a US tournament did the same thing and said fuck trump the same result would happen so i don't get why you people don't see that. They obviously have this rule in place to not have any political or other things that could damage them in their events
What was it that leftists love to say? Speech has consequences? This is a good example of it. We all know that a "rule" is not a 'must always do' kinda thing in these situations and in this case where they not only canned the guy who did but also two unrelated casters there is only two three things to say:

China is Asshole

Blizzard is Asshole

Fuck China
Literally an official Blizzard statement:

 *‚ÄúWe are very angered and disappointed at what happened at the event and do not condone it in any way. We also highly object the spreading of personal political beliefs in this manner‚Ä¶We will always respect and defend the pride of our country.‚Äù*
The caster's were in on it. The caster's prompted blitzchung to make his statement. That is why they were canned.  


NFL, NBA, MLB all have similar stipulations for their players. They are welcome to their opinions, but may not use the league(S) as a platform to project those opinions. And while there is usually more incremental repercussions in those leagues (relatively small fines, shorter suspensions, and grow from there for repeat incidents), the penalty handed down from Blizzard's APAC office was consistent with their contract with this player.  


Blitzchung was welcome to use his personal social media to make his statement. He and the casters chose to commandeer the hearthstone webcast to give their message knowing that they would likely be penalized for it and still considered it to be a worthwhile endeavor.
That was less official and more that someone on their blizzard taiwan team made. Also that's not the full statement

Wouldn't they just remove Mei from the game rather than lose China playerbase, I mean if Blizz asked CCP nicely and they were allowed to do so.  Lets make DF and Sigma the next mascots for Free HK

Thanks for the platinum, kind stranger!!
People need to find out what company runs blizzard's servers and start boycotting them as well. A company like this should receive 0 support from consumers or other companys.  Don't just stop there or using video game characters as well, also find out who produces their merchandise and who sells it. Boycott ANYONE that supports Blizzard. The whole HK situation is showing what pure evil and good really are.
Dont worry Blizzard just officially  **apologized** on the chinese Weiboo account **to china** that something bad happened and that they stay strong with the dignity of china.

&#x200B;

so yep. blizzard is choosing china they dont care.
"Time to start a blizzard!"
Did they really ban the commentators too?
i really hope this happens
wrg, smile any no matter what
did 4 acutally happen? that would be so tasty
I hate outrage culture 
So many idiots blowing things out of proportion of what's reality.
wow so china also banned overwatch what a shocker they despise videogames and shouldnt have ever allowed videosgames back in the country because now our games are being shitty and we have shitty movies due to china
"..who did nothing wrong."  
Yea, lets pretend that he didn't break the rules or lets just assume that breaking the rules is fine.
Oh I will be so excited if number 4 happens.
I thought for a moment it had happened.
They miscalculated badly and will suffer because of that.

They already locked the option to delete battlenet accounts and now require sending them photo of ID. That's almost certainly illegal in EU (you can't ask for personal information in order to let people delete the personal information you already have), and they will likely be hit by a big fine (Microsoft and Google got fines in billions of dollars for breaking EU law). EU is a bigger market than China despite less people.

So yeah, it will hurt them. Maybe it's still worth it, but I doubt.

Xi Jinping does looks like Roadhogs bellybutton
Hey! That‚Äôs an insult to Roadhog!
That's going to screw with their OWL league or w.e.
Is Mai going to be banned from all OWL events? What about the next character that's picked, and so on. It's a losing proposition for Blizzard and that's a huge win for human rights.
That's why Every Overwatch character needs to be used in some way, not just Mei. Mei still needs to be the leader of this.
If they removed Mei from the game because of this, the backlash would double what it is now.
Unlike Blizzard, he did nothing wrong!
You've posted the exact same comment on pretty much every thread.  I wonder if it'll flag you as a bot.

!isbot
Should've is a contraction of should have, not should of.
Everyone in that subreddit already knows about it. If you really want to protest, then other protestors aren't the best audience to target. If you want a lot of people to know about it, then your best bet is to post about it in subreddits not directly related to Blizzard (but stick with that subreddit's rules and try to submit it in a way relevant to them). There you'll find and inform a lot more people who haven't heard of it yet.

Activision, their reputation has already been shit, this is probably gonna be the final blow
Just boycott amazon, I bet they will run out of money soon.
Pretty sure they are relying rather heavily on amazon AWS servers.
any source for this?
More like "end a blizzard"
They were giggling under the desk after they told him to say his eight words. Seems like they knew a rule was about to be broken. Not that it's right. I unsubbed, still love a lot about most of their games but would rather stand with Blitzchung and HK.
4 and 5 are the stretch goals
That hasn't happened. That's the goal of the people trying to turn Mei into an icon for HK protestors.
I don't believe that actually happened. Or I can't find any corroborating article on it.
Did you ever read about the Civil Rights Movement ?
>rules or lets just assume that breaking the rules is fine.

Sometimes rules are bad and need to be broken. What is moral isn't always lawful.
Taking a step back, that does not seem like a good thing at all. The ideal scenario is that China does not ban games just because they criticise the CCP. Yes, Blizzard deserves to face consequences for this, but I fail to see how the CCP censoring a game could be a good thing.
Hah! Jokes on them! I used an old Student drivers liscence from the US! And I'm a Canadian citizen.
Idk if you've seen but people have been mass unsubbing and deleting their account.

Chinas revenue to blizzard is around 6% atm. They did this too soon, and if enough people do something, it WILL hurt them.

Pretty hard to boycott Amazon.
All over reddit where the posts don't get censored heavily (most subs)

https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfkmp1/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/
On principle, of course China censoring a game is bad, but there is a certain irony and justice for Blizzard to bend over backward to support China only for the whole controversy to result in them losing the very Chinese market they fought to keep
It's not that, it's the fact that because Blizzard never acknowledged the fact that what they're doing is wrong, they won't have the support of the rest of the Blizzard community. As a result, it's gonna hurt them that much more.
I think getting OW banned is a very good result.  This would make any other corporation think twice about bending over to China if the people are willing to get the company in bad terms with them.
The point is to force Blizzard's hand. If Overwatch is banned, then that throws a wrench into their financial calculus -- if one of their big titles can't be used in the Chinese market, does it still make financial sense to support China despite the backlash from Americans and Europeans?
yes it would seem that way on reddit, but is that the case in reality?
They could always say fuckit and just shift everything to China.
There is. I've been hit by it too many times
They recouped some rep with Crash, Spyro, and CTR.
Thank you.  Exactly this.
I totally get that there would be a sense of satisfaction in Blizzard's censorship backfiring against them, but when you fight fire with fire, everyone burns. Nobody wins in that outcome, but Blizzard deservedly loses.

I think a better outcome would be for Blizzard to embrace China completely, only to be shunned by the West and see their revenue plummet when they realise there isn't as much money in China as there is in the rest of the world.
In reality there are people unsubbing and/or deleting their accounts. So yes, in reality this may have an effect, the impact of that effect will depend on the numbers. I unsubbed and deleted my account. They wont see a cent from me, in the end my decision alone wont hurt Blizzard, but that doesnt mean I have to support them. Fuck Blizzard.
No lmao there are still over a million active users on WoW alone
Ain't gonna be that easy by a long shot
Or burn them out of the market completely, it's almost given that you lean towards money as a business, but if the direction of the company has no morals other than money, it should burn down completely.
You do realise forest fires are often fought with controlled fires, right? Fighting fire with fire is exactly how you stop said destructive fire from spreading, snuffing it out.
The problem with that is that there frankly is more money in China than the rest of the world. The amount of potential gamers in China to get money from is many times every other major country. You think they would be doing this if they only got 5% of their money from China? They‚Äôre doing this because they can potentially drop their entire western audience and still make more money than before off China. 

The only way to actually punish blizzard is to remove that option from the equation. We have to get the games banned in China.
You're an inspiration!
Only a Million not two million?  i remember 12 million in WotLK xD
blizzard get 12% of their revenue from the whole of the asian region
Idk the exact numbers, this is just the lowest possible guess. And I'm talking about who's online, not active subscriptions

I forget if it‚Äôs in the original comic, but the halo getting removed in the fourth panel is a nice touch.
No king rules forever.
Should have been OW reaper taking it away.
They sorta went full Arthas.
Metzen be like Imma dip out before this China thing blows up.
Overwatch was one of my favourite games. But the time has come until blizzard sort shit out...
Was my favorite dev when i was young. Now theyre dead to me. Rip Blizzard 1991-2008.
Even after this fiasco blizzard wasn't a good company,This time they just showed their true face when they we're pushed too far.
Tell me ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, when was it that Blizzard the Wise abandoned reason for madness?
If we want to really hurt blizzard, Sony and Microsoft need to join in the boycott, not allowing them to connect to their platforms.  Literally force blizzards hand in making a statement.

Edit: grammar
It‚Äôs almost 2020, what blizzard needs to realize is that consumers aren‚Äôt morons are we do care what happens with other humans

Equation equals: play another game that isn‚Äôt aligned with giving a bj to China
Good company

Chinese Government and Money ruined
Oook, but, Activision-Blizzard‚Äôs stock has dropped exactly zero points since this controversy began.


Not that the outrage isn‚Äôt meaningful; I think generating awareness, shaping public sentiment and issuing a warning cry for the inevitable future wherein we contend with this again are valuable.

But.

Activision has walked away from this essentially unscathed.

Edit: that‚Äôs it children, downvote things you dislike hearing independent of whether or not they‚Äôre on-topic contributions. No chance at all your petulance is also why Activision is going to ignore you for a week and then keep spending your wow fees.
25 years of being the best of the best, wiped away in just one year

That IS impressive
Good-bye blizzard. You have your head up your money. Pathetic.
How to win us back:

1. Reinstate Blitzchung and casters.
2. Take the financial hit with China.
3. Apologize to literally everyone and tell China to eat a dick.

Sad that probably none of these things will happen
I grow up with blizzard and it‚Äôs really sad to them go out like this. This company has no chance of redemption in my eyes.
We can't let this die. This is so much bigger. America should not bend the knee to anyone for the alrighty dollar. These corporations forgot where they came from. They have lost their way. It's up to us to regain the morals they have lost. 

Keep it up.

Blizzard hasn't been a good company since they sold out to Activision.

Selling out further to China just sealed it.

‚ÄúYou lied to your employees and betrayed the customers who paid for your products, What is happening to you, Blizzard? Is China all that‚Äôs important to you?‚Äù

Yeah, full Arthas.
"I'll take any risk to protect my investors"
I was having a similar thought the other day.  The game company that loves making good characters go bad or have tragic endings seems to be following suit.
"This entire fan base must be purged"
"You have crossed a terrible threshold, Blizzard."
"This company shall fall. And from the ashes shall arise a new greed, that will suck the very cock of China."
I had the same thoughts, that's why i made an Arthas drawing, quoting Terenas Menethil  
' *Remember, Our line has always ruled with wisdom and strength.*  
 *And i know you will show restraint when exercising your great power*, **Blizzard '** [**https://imgur.com/a/e7tW5SJ**](https://imgur.com/a/e7tW5SJ)

Same here. I took a little break from it and was seriously itching to come back, ready to drop money on some fresh loot boxes. I reinstalled it the night before this started going down.

I re-uninstalled it the following morning.

I feel ya. Even though I don't spend any new money on it, I got to the title screen the other day and I just couldn't...  Going to need to find a new hero shooter
What happened in 2008?
I feel the last panel was unnecessary.
Blizzard aren‚Äôt going to make a statement. They picked their side, they‚Äôre going to stick with it. Imagine if they changed their mind and lost the Chinese market, they‚Äôd have to come back to their Western market which is currently in an uproar
I'm convinced they will never make a statement because they're so freaking arrogant and convinced they're in the right.  Look at how they defended their design decisions of the past:  no backtracking unless forced by dropping numbers and a flat, "No, you're wrong," style response.  If people aren't excited about a new thing at Blizzcon, it's because the player base is too damned stupid to know they're supposed to have phones and get behind Blizzard's vision no matter what.  It's not because they took a bad read of what the players wanted and made a mistake in pursuing it.  Of course their approach is the right one.

They're not making a statement because they're convinced their playerbase is a bunch of whiny, entitled idiots who will never leave for good, and they're able to hold up all the people still populating their servers as "proof" that they're right.  The only way Blizzard will ever backtrack from that arrogance of believing they're always right is if their games completely tank and stay empty.

And unfortunately, there are still a number of people who have so little else going on in their lives that they can't (or won't) disconnect from the game.  Each one who logs in boosts Blizzard's hubris a little bit more.

We're making a moral stand, and I think we're making a difference, but we've got years of Blizzard having an insultingly low opinion of us as disposable addicts to overcome with this before they consider us worth the effort of a press release.
Eh, I don't think unrelated corporations will get involved, nor should they.
Stocks don't move that fast....  Nothing short of an Enron scandal or global recession will cause a stock to crater within one week.

Stocks represent the best guess of the value today for all future income.

Is destiny being boycotted?  Is call of duty of being boycotted?  No?  Just the blizzard properties that are already mature and have limited room for growth?  What evidence do you have that sales are changing?

These are all things that financial pros care about, since their job is mostly math and a little bit of emotion.

Give it some time, and be sure to compare them to their competitors (if EA gains 15% and Activision gains 2%...)
You're right, a week long protest does nothing.  But if people actually stick to their guns and boycott for even 2 or 3 months, we will see some changes.  Everything is monitored, so if there is a big drop off in active players, stockholders will notice when those numbers release
This isn't even true, they are down 3.2% this week and are down 27% for the year...

What is most disheartening about all of this to me is the fact that Blizzard honestly had no say in this. Everybody has completely glossed over the fact that Blizzard literally doesn't have a CEO, as Activision did not replace Mark Morheim when he stepped down last year or so. Quite literally Activision is calling all of the shots, and they are letting the Blizzard name be tarnished while also simultaneously placing pressure on Blizzard to turn it around. It's honestly disgusting.
[deleted]
I've been wondering if this is a case of chinese buying up the stocks they are happy with what happened, while everyone else is upset.
It is actually up 2,72% today. So no it won't affect blizzard at all.
Too soon to say, if people actually are following through with canceling subs, it likely won't hit stocks till the next quarterly earnings report.
A lot of people probably have standing buy orders they haven't deleted, or Chinese investors could even be buying up the flagging stock to make it look like a profitable decision for Blizzard to have made.

You're right, it isn't the immediate landslide victory everyone was hoping for, but a plummet in subscriptions should still make a difference at the next annual or quarterly meeting.
Their stock wont really change until the next game comes out.
Why would their stocks drop? It's obvious to investors they are prioritizing China's market. This means, more money...
Stocks ebb and flow constantly. You won‚Äôt see any changes til the next fiscal quarter if it shows a large decrease in customers and revenue. Til then it‚Äôll be business as usual for them.
unscathed so far...we want to hurt them we need to not buy their next game in several months or years  


this is the start, not the end
>Do you want to know why Blizzard's stock hasn't gone down like EA's did?

>Because EA actually launched a game that crashed and made a ton less money than it was supposed to. Blizzard hasn't done anything that the boycott could be felt with, and the only thing that Blizzard has coming up to show it is Blizzcon.

>If you look at the Stocks for EA back in July of last year, they were at a massive $148 per share. Then Battlefront 2 came out in August and did abysmally, causing it to lower to $76 by December.

>The only thing that pulled EA's stock out of its slump was a very successful game coming out, which was Apex Legends, and if you look at their stocks, they still aren't above $100 again (They did peak into $101 twice, but that was because of Anthem).

>Blizzcon and the next Blizzard and/or activision game will show massive damage to their stocks, if the boycott holds until them.
I'm gonna make an educated guess and say that China is buying their stock in the same amount as the sales, so the price keeps being stable. I'd have to check their market volume and activities but too lazy right now as I'm off to bed. if someone wants to have a go perhaps we could find rough numbers of short hands that left the sinking ship in these last few days.
You havnt even said a thing of substance. Why shouldnt we do what we can? Even though it may be small.
They're a company. If they weren't concerned with money they wouldn't still exist.
or make Diablo 4 a good game.

Lets be honest here, gamers have a very short memory and gaming is an addiction. So when they need their next fix they will take it. As much as I want them to crash and burn I doubt it will make a difference in the long run. If gamers had some conscience and self respect EA wouldn't exist.
I for one am not interested in being "won back". All I actually needed to know about Blizzard is the fact that they are associated with Activision...that's more than enough for me. This whole debacle is just icing, and a cherry.
Same here brother. I will always remember and cherish my memories of the Blizzard of old. It's important to understand this is not the same company. They only share a name. All of the greats that made old blizzard what it was are long gone.
Protesting at Blizzcon is all well and good, but you're basically paying them to protest. Why not just not even go?
Nope. If they change their ways the boycott ends.
Blizzard was going to shit long before activision bought them.
Blizzard knew what they were getting into, its not like Activision bad rep wasn't popular knowledge back ten.
No, not these days. Blizzard is far from a good company, even without Activision. Time and time again they keep proving their target audience isn't the people that carried them to fame anymore. They couldn't care less about those who have played their games since childhood. 

They've alienated those who care about their games in favour of the mouth breathers from twitter. The same type of people they've steadily been hiring to replace those that they fire.
Like "most people" don't even know what Diablo: Immortal is?
Silly me for forgetting how the fourth panel went. Seen this comic used as a template so many times, it just gets fuzzy when I tried to recall how it looks.

acquisition
Blizzard depends on corporations like Sony and Microsoft to disseminate their games, potentially eliminating a platform would be detrimental to sales figures.  But neither would do it because they need China too.
You mean how blizzard was involved in an unrelated event? They really should drop the title of game publisher and just get into politics since that‚Äôs what they are known for now
Point of order, Bungie have since separated from Acti. Destiny 2 is no longer on the Bnet launcher but on Steam.
Just FYI, stocks can move pretty quickly- Roku dropped close to 30 percent in a single day off of a single analyst changin their rating and Comcast announcing a giveaway of a single product.

But ATVI won't move a whole lot, because, as you said, there are many more products that aren't really associated with Blizzard that still provide significant value to the company.
people think googling NYSE or NASDAQ makes them economist. The real effect of this fiasco will be shown at the end of Q4 in december. That's when you know if people are really into it or just virtue-signaling for fake internet updoots.
‚ÄúStocks don't move that fast....  Nothing short of an Enron scandal or global recession will cause a stock to crater within one week.‚Äù

*laughs in biotech and pharma*
I very sincerely hope you are correct, but, I think in this case (and I think the temporary freeze on deleting accounts supports this) that Activision is expecting sentiment to fizzle in the face of consumers having to actually forgo the use of their favourite addiction software. I fear they‚Äôve made the right prediction here.
Yep, agree. It‚Äôs on us.
I don't know where you get your figures from, but their stock price was $47.03 jan 1 and it's $55.03 now, a 17% increase, just today it is up $1.34 (2.5%)

https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=blizzard+stock+price

The only metrics by which they are down are the 1 year, 5 day or 1 month prices, if you look at 5 years, YTD or 6 months they are all positive
J. Allen Brack is literally the CEO so I'm not sure where you're hearing these things
Sure, I‚Äôm just taking issue with these celebratory posts, suggesting that actiblizzard has somehow been punished. they haven‚Äôt. the outrage is valuable but if you want them to listen a great deal more is necessary. *I‚Äôm* not buying anything from the company for now, either. But no one‚Äôs been vanquished, here, no victories have been won, and Activision is most certainly not ‚Äúon fire‚Äù.
I really, really doubt it.

The thing is, we‚Äôre in a unique time for consumer relations. In the past, if you were unhappy with a company you bought from the competitor.

But there *isn‚Äôt* really a competitor for, say, Azeroth; if you have played WoW for years, there‚Äôs no where else to go. If you‚Äôve dumped hundreds of dollars into your HS collection, you can‚Äôt take it to MtG or whatever, and neither are those experiences *really* direct replacements (compared with, say, switching from Nike to Rebok). Additionally, games are addictiion software, they‚Äôre engineered to be emotionally difficult to stop using, let alone abandon.

I think, honestly, what‚Äôs really happening is that Activision-Blizzard have the data, run the numbers, and accurately concluded that this will, in fact, blowover, insofar as we‚Äôll hate them more but not significantly pay them less.

And if data-driven analytics all indicate that their profitability won‚Äôt be impacted, shareholders have no reason to pull out. The tl;dr is, the outrage doesn‚Äôt actually reflect consumer activity in this case.
Very well could be exactly what's happening. If that's the case I expect them to leave the country, either willingly or by economic force if necessary.
I've wondered that, too, but it could also be lingering buy orders for when the stock dips below a certain price being triggered, too.

It would definitely fit the government's M.O. to throw some cash at the stock to make it look like falling in line and toeing the party line is profitable, though.
A voice of reason.
I sincerely hope you‚Äôre right. If the number of people reporting their departure from blizz products is real, we‚Äôll see soon enough. I‚Äôd like it if my ‚Äúrealism‚Äù turns out to be cynicism. Good chat, ntmy.
In the normal course of events, yes; but (actual) trauma to a business usually results in reactive selling; hence my position that Activision is doing fine.
I‚Äôm not remotely versed in market economics, but I saves your reply because I‚Äôm curious about that too, now.
>	Not that the outrage isn‚Äôt meaningful; I think generating awareness, shaping public sentiment and issuing a warning cry for the inevitable future wherein we contend with this again are valuable.
In a strict sense yes, but they made a choice of money over good will. Not everything a corporation does has to be about money.
They would much rather you didn't go than you go and embarrass them there :)
Becuase it's already sold out and the tickets are nonrefundable. The people who bought tickets to blizzcon months ago already gave them money. Not going would be a wasted opportunity to spread awareness. Also, a waste of money.
Well, I meant that.

>You have gone to a place I cannot follow. I hope you find reason.

I feel like thats familiar but cant place it...
Correct, and I don't want Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo to be in charge of what games should be available on their platforms based on politics. It's a slippery slope. 

Having other companies censor in the opposite direction is not a solution. It's up to consumers to decide who to support or not.
Blizzard made a political call about one of its pro players and streamers at one of its gaming events. People now don't want to pay them money. Not sure how its "unrelated" or what you're on about.
Oh boy am I glad they skedaddled soon enough to avoid this shit.
Also in part that ATVI lost nearly 30% last year over two months.

It could very well be near a technical resistance point.
Aren't they down, like, 30-ish% compared to "just before Blizzcon 2018"-time? I seem to remember the stock fiddling about at almost 80 or so same time last year.
Always happy to share sources! Glad we can compile to see what's really going on here.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/activision-blizzard-faces-corporate-culture-crisis-following-gamer-suspension-2019-10-10

Positive over the last few years seems to make sense, considering how well the last WoW expansion did as well as the release and thriving of Overwatch. To me, it looks like since last Blizzcon they took a big hit (Diablo Immortal?). BFA probably started to suffer from sub-loss around that time as well, as it dropped about 2 months prior. I would also assume that the 6-month positives you see are directly tied to in-game store purchases within BFA. Store mounts and other items you can buy in-game with real money have been releasing at a much higher rate than ever before. In my head, the only logical reason for this is to buff those numbers up that they lost from the underwhelming reception of BFA and Diablo Immortal in the eyes of their investors... I am personally worries that this will continue once Diablo Immortal is inveitably dropped/re-mentioned during this year's con. It would make sense that Activision would want to protect their ability to monetize the Chinese market given that is where they make the majority of their mobile game profits. It just is sad that Blizzard games are being used to seemingly fill the pockets of Activision corporate overhead...
That dude is a lot of things, but not a CEO.
True, but I think this will have an effect over all, there is also the truth about when your hot your hot, when your not your not.  There is often  a delay in these things that take a few years, after diablo immortal and this, people are going to be more critical about what blizzard does, and question it more.  Look at fallout 76, it hasn't killed bethesda, BUT the problems people ignored in skyrim, morrowind, and oblivion are going to be FAR less likly to be ignored in elderscrolls 6.  

Same here, mistakes and problems that blizzard makes form this point on arn't going to be given as much of a benefit of the doubt.

AKA when your hot, people ignore the problems and praise the good stuff, when your not, people focus on the problems and the good things just don't get the same traction.

EA's starting to go through this, as they are both pushing fans too far, and fans have less tolerance for things.
Yeah, it's a fear of mine that this will all just wash away with people going back to the game because of shiny events and loot boxes, too.  I'm sure some of that fear is because of how tempting I find them personally, despite being searingly angry and feeling betrayed.  My hope is that if I can stay strong, other people will at least be as dedicated as I am, if not more, if for no other reason than gamers do really like being angry at stuff, so this is our skill.

But really we'll just have to wait and see.
it's much more effective to simply speak out about them and never touch any of their products ever again. they'd pocket the cash and not give a damn about whatever it is you do from there.
from what i've seen, it looks like they care more about money than their reputation
Ah, then agreed with what you meant, just not with what you wrote, lol.
A lot of shitty decisions in their games and PR has been on their own.
Seeing that Activision Blizzards stock market value this day is exactly 66.9% of the value one year ago, I'd venture a guess that some people still remember something. And no, this current debacle didn't dent it enough to account for that drop. It was still around the current level a month ago.

Unless you would suggest that it's purely coincidental that their stocks plummeted in the weeks right after Blizzcon 2018 and have remained at that level up until today?
They got tired of Acti like 6 months ago
Absolutely, good point.
I'd be really surprised if they tried to push diablo immortal after it's reception last year.

As far as the stock price goes, it looks like it hit an all time peak in september 18 (around $80) was on a downward trend until about June and has been on the upswing since. Looking at the numbers overall it doesn't seem like it has immediately effected the stock price but then again we are only a few days into this situation and stocks take some time to respond to stuff like this, while the investors bide their time and wait to see how the whole thing shakes out.
Idk if you're being metaphorical or not but he literally is, that's his title
Well said; I utterly agree with you that subsequent disappointment in product quality (mobile diablo lololol) are probably going to have more dramatic impacts than they might have done after this much damage to the loyalty blizz once enjoyed. I do, however, think that making bad products will also be necessary; sentiment alone is more likely to be a catalyst than a cause.
This is beautifully honest my dude.

We definitely don‚Äôt have to stop playing blizz games, just funding them. This has to move slowly, and it‚Äôs waaaaay bigger than any one company besides. In my original post i meant what I said; the outrage does *something*. I personally think the reasonable commitment is to stay informed and vigilant fornthe moment when more than conversation is due. And I write my MPs (governers, in the US, I think).
True, but the money is already lost, so they might as well make sure Blizzard can't use press photos from their expensive event.
I really hope your right, although my gut tells me that they will want to monetize this as soon as possible. They had a playable demo at Blizzcon last year, so I am assuming that they will make an actual announcement with a date this con. Considering how they protected their hand in the that market, would they not want to monetize it as soon as possible?

Peaking in September sounds right on the money as that was not too long after the release of BFA. On a downward trend until June makes sense as that was when they dropped another store mount as well as that was when they did their last pre-planned Beta for classic (Although they did one right before release (late July/early August?), it wasn't announced that it would happen until is basically happened).

You are right though as only time will tell. Investors I am sure are playing the field here carefully. Blizzcon will be Paramount this year for Blizzard, I just hope they get it right.
He is the President, not the CEO.
as people said last year and I agree, diablo immortal would have been fine if it was along side diablo 4 announcement or even a diablo 1 or 2 remake, least something to give us hope.
I could be wrong but I have a feeling they are going to minimize the Diablo Immortal exposure here and really push it in the Chinese gaming market, which was their target for it anyways.

I just want to say the atrocities to HK protesters won‚Äôt go unvoiced and blizzard trying to hide these atrocities will never be accepted. This is a crime to all of humanity to us as a species. It doesn‚Äôt matter the nationality or creed.
While we are at it let‚Äôs not forget about Mulan and Disney. They support the HK police.
This has already been pushed by the wayside.  Blizzard released a statement, they aren‚Äôt going to do another.  

Personally I‚Äôm done with the company, I hope others follow suit but I doubt they will comment further or make any changes to what‚Äôs been said/done.  The damage has happened and there isn‚Äôt going back, it‚Äôs pretty clear where they stand and what they value.  It‚Äôs a shame, a company I‚Äôve always respected and grown up with has changed for the worst.

Boycott China any way you can.
Woooh! Let's crash their social point system!
Blizzard must be so proud!
You people are embarrassing.  No wonder why I stopped playing Overwatch.  You seem to create conspiracy theories and continue to make memes regardless of Blizzard disproving your claims entirely.  Others who reply in anger clearly didn't do research at all.

(the Chinese pride tweet was mistranslated and doesn't represent Blizzard, in case you were going to use that)
Blizzcon is gonna be a great show in a few weeks.
This overused Political Trending is getting cringy. Stop pretending to care about HK, you didn't 10 years ago, and you spamming chats and comments about how great of a human being you are toward these people wont change anything. This is the new Israel vs Palestine, and if you don't wanna follow it, you're out of the picture, pretty much.

You don't think it's at all suspicious that Blizzard reacted so quickly and harshly with his punishment then?

Even then, if Blizzard doesn't want political/social issues on their streams or competitions, then they should be consistent with that. Giving a quick and overly harsh ban/prize removal over a Hong Kong support statement should be an equal punishment to voicing LGBT rights and support on their streams, but there are no issues with those social issues being broadcast. All in all, it's the hypocrisy while trying to defend their actions that is so disappointing.

In the Chinese weibo response from someone who translated on Twitter, the post did not specifically state that China was being defended. 

"A better translation would be -pride and dignity of Countries-"

This is reinforced by how "ÊàëÂõΩ means our country. ÂõΩÂÆ∂ means countries."

Source:  https://twitter.com/HrTobi/status/1182948745643606016?s=20

Lastly, the Chinese weibo has no affiliation with Blizzard as a whole.  The official word in response that's being meme'd is the correct answer.  There is no affiliation with China.
Nothing was proven to "disprove" in the first place.  Everyone that's claiming Blizzard is directly influenced by China is a blatant lie.
Most people just jumped on this trend, that's my whole point. There are fine people in this movement, but most of them wouldn't have cared less if we told them about HK 10 years ago. Documents were signed a long time ago and HK has a reputation of protesting a lot, they did so even under British Reign.

Now if you refuse to be part of the HK Train you end up being called a troll or a Chinese Agent..
I compared it to the Palestine/Israeli situation not for the situation itself, but for social reactions that i have found very similar.
Only because it's the latest outrage circle jerk. Look at EA and loot boxes making children addicted to gambling. Boycott Battlefront 2!

Yeah they are still going strong.
In which civ this bug was?
Agreed, more annoying than punpolice even
Well blizzard themselves weren't the ones to react honestly it was netease as they run everything over there for blizzard but since they give them authority to run everything for them it still falls on them. I'm pretty sure that any but decisions like this will now go through blizzard hq from now on. Regardless i don't think the punishment was harsh really it was using their platform for something that have taken no stance on and will never take a public one because businesses shouldn't. They shouldn't be looked at as a moral compass or to what to support. They're there for only money at the end of the day. The people that originally made Warcraft didn't make the game out of the kindness of their hearts. They made it for passion and money.

Now yes the LGBT thing is a bit hypocritical by the difference there is that they took a stance on that due to business trends not to really have a stance at all
Exactly. If they can't defend their basic rights, I shouldn't be able to defend me liking dudes.
that wasnt a blizzard run event thats why
Well i am not going to argue which country is Blizzard China trying to refer to, but i have to say as a native chinese speaker, your translation is wrong.

We have no plurals in Chinese, Normally if we are talking about a single country, we would use the word "ÂõΩÂÆ∂" or "ÂõΩ".  if we want to say countries. We would use the word "ÂêÑÂõΩ",  The Word "ÂêÑ" means All in this case.

When we really want to use the word "ÂõΩÂÆ∂" to refer Countries, We need to add words before it,  for example  We would say ÂæàÂ§ö ÂõΩÂÆ∂ or  ÊâÄÊúâ ÂõΩÂÆ∂. ÂæàÂ§ö means A lot. ÊâÄÊúâ means ALL.

So Blizzard clearly meant one single ÂõΩÂÆ∂ Country ONLY.

> "ÊàëÂõΩ" means our country.

This is incorrect as well, That Twitter dude should really stop pretending he knows chinese.

 The word Êàë means "my" or " I ". Its a singular word refers to one person ONLY,  "ÊàëÂõΩ" means my country, and there is difference between saying my and our.

If we want to say Our Country. We would say ÊàëÂÄëÁöÑÂõΩÂÆ∂,  ÊàëÂÄë means our here.
It's okay. I'm sure you're social score is secure by now, you can quit trying to pretend it wasn't very obvious.
Listen, this situation has blown up the last couple of months because of the massive demonstrations. That‚Äôs when most people became aware of the issue. People are not jumping on this because of blizzard, and I really do believe people would have cared if they‚Äôd been made aware of it 10 years ago. Being mad that people are aware now is really stupid, you should be happy the situation is gaining the traction it deserves worldwide. You should be happy more and more people are siding with HK and demanding China be held responsible for all the terrible things they‚Äôve done both to their own people and to other groups of people within their country.
all youve been doing for the past month is repeating the same shit.

We get it, you're a paid chinese agent, shut up.
You mean the game that they completely changed because of the outrage and that's actually really good now?
feature\*
The very first one.

Since then they've always given him something to reference that as a feature.
You're right when you say that Blizzard will be keeping a much closer eye on these things, they should have recognized anything affiliated with Blizzard still impacts them. 

The recent alteration in the punishment is reasonable and much more so considering the original. A 12 month ban and $3,000 in prize money stripped away because of a vague, catch-all rule is extremely harsh especially if you compare it to a punishment like the one Dallas Fuel's XQC received (4 game ban and $2,000 fine for making a single "homophobic" remark). Of course, you can argue that XQC's blunder was on a private stream, opposed to the primary Hearthstone stream, but both would still affect Blizzard and the actions taken are quite disproportionate to each other.

I agree that a company should not be scorned for wanting to do business with China. They need to make money and people who are angry at them just for making a market in China are as foolish as those who complain about cosmetic lootboxes being a cashgrab. Regardless, I disagree and feel that companies should still be held at a moral standard. For instance, it would similarly be foolish to say that it's alright for major corporations to not be conscious of negatively impacting the environment because altenate methods are cheaper and their primary goal is to save money anyway. Above all, companies (and people) should stand for what is right instead of what jingles, and there is nothing wrong with holding them to that standard especially when the opportunity presents itself (such as with this situation).

Finally (sorry this post got a bit long), the LGBT factor brings up an interesting issue, doesn't it? Since a majority of the western audience shares that same belief, you're saying Blizzard made a business decision to promote it. Though you would think Hong Kong's independence is also a popular, shared Western viewpoint, so why would they not choose to support that if their decision was not somehow affected by the China (which they explicitly opposed in their statement). It's that hypocrisy and sneaky behavior that I, and probably many others, want addressed. Blizzard should be more transparent, more consistent, and be held at a moral standpoint, whether they conduct business with China or not.
Oh, huh...

Yeah sure enough, I could have sworn I saw it was Blizz official, but it's an outside company that partners with them. That's a stickier situation then, good to know.

Thank you.
Even if that's true, the weibo account is not associated with the main branch of Blizzard.  Their opinions do not reflect the company as a whole.  The issue is that by saying this, people won't want to listen because it is their only leverage in the argument.
I don't care about my social score. I speak my mind instead of following the rest of the horde.
Of course they are. But that isn't the first time HK is protesting, they have been doing that even during British Colonization.

I am not saying they are jumping in this train because of Blizzard, but many, many people seem to jump because it is a popular thing to do. I am not "mad", but i sure think many people are hypocrites and don't actually care. You don't hear them talking about the dozens of other terrible situations in this world either.. Then again i respect other people's opinion, but i can feel many folks are following this trending because... it is the big current thing and everybody's following it.
Yeah i'm definetly paid for holding criticism. No. For the past month i've been in university. You repeat the same shit in that movement and that's fine, i express skepticism and i'm a ChINEsE aGEnT. lmao.
And the company that continues raking in profits that weren't even impacted in the slightest
no problem, if people are going to raise pitchforks lets at least do this with the correct info lol thats all im doing mostly lol
I don't get your point, if that is the official Weibo account of Blizzard in China, how can you say the opinions do not reflect their company? How can you say Blizzard China is not associated with the main branch of Blizzard? You are talking like Blizzard China and Blizzard Entertainment are two independent companies.

If that's true, don't you think that's pretty easy to solve this PR mess, Blizzard should just make another statement to declare that they have nothing to deal with Blizzard China, might as well sue Blizzard China or whoever in charge of that Weibo account for damaging their reputation?
So what you‚Äôre saying is that a company changing course and making a more satisfying product doesn‚Äôt matter because it doesn‚Äôt afffect their profit margins?

Because if that‚Äôs the case, all you‚Äôre saying to me is that loot boxes are pointless and have no place in video games
The Weibo account is run by Netease which likely knows that Blizzard can‚Äôt really do anything to fight at the moment. So technically the guy is right in the fact that it doesn‚Äôt really represent Blizzard. It wears its name but overall it is run by Netease which opens a whole new can of worms. Anyways hope ya all are having a good day :)
No, I'm just saying that all of this "effort" against Blizzard is hilarious, and I'd be willing to bet that in a month or two, they'll barely have noticed it.

Granted my point hasn't been made in the best way, but that's ok.

Also, I'm not sure what more people want after the latest press release, anyway.
>The Weibo account is run by Netease which likely knows that Blizzard can‚Äôt really do anything to fight at the moment.

I think you actually gave the point, this is exactly why people are so angry. 

The point is not who runs that account. Doesn't matter that Netease or whoever runs that Weibo account, The thing dose matter is they knew exactly that Blizzard could do nothing to fight against them at this moment, because the potential risk of losing the whole China's Market, because they knew Blizzard would value Money more than ideologies, which is rightfully so as a company, just too ugly to be openly displayed.
They can say they disagree.
Fair enough point and to be honest that makes more sense :)
And you know this how? Do you work for the company? Btw this is an honest question as if I am given actual proof showing the opposite of my statements I will fully back off and change my statements to reflect my mistakes :)
I have not seen any proof or reason why Blizzard couldn't say "Netease made a statement, we however disagree with it because etcetc". That is if they don't actually agree with that statement of course.

I detest the "Blizzard may want to disagree, but they can't say it" narrative. Although it has a certain irony considering how the chinese feel about free speech.

Don‚Äôt you mean ‚ÄúA-Mei-Zing‚Äù?

Jesus that was quick.

china has had rampant corruption, massacres, deadly pollution, and an oppressive government this whole time and only now, when a video game player is banned from a card game, is when the entirety of the internet enters hysteria...

Lol, the resistance is against china and about freeing Hong Kong.

Lets not forget that and replace an evil government with an inept gaming company.
Yasssss! It‚Äôs working!!!
So what exactly are you crying about? That people didnt listen to you specifically? That people now care? That you don't get to be in the limelight? What exactly is your angle?
I'm not sure what your point is. Are you upset that now people actually care? There's always some sort of catalyst that gets people involved, for gamers this is that catalyst. A lot of people don't seem to care about cancer or certain diseases, until they or someone close to them gets diagnosed, do you go on mocking them because all of a sudden they care about that disease? Instead of embracing them, your rhetoric is an attempt to push people further from the cause, I just don't understand what your point is.
Protesting is about calling out bullshit, wherever it comes from.
Just because something is worse than something else doesn't mean it should be blindly accepted as if it doesn't matter. Also, that issue has nothing to do with what Blizzard did anyway.
That the fact the atrocities of china have gone on for this long and only when a kids internet cardgame is thrown into the mix do people begin to throw a fit about it. The outrage stems from a temporary issue, and is temporary in nature, weeks will pass and people will fade back into a veiled indifference on the actions of mainland china. Since you don‚Äôt understand this you‚Äôre a contributing factor to the overall issue of this cycle, but this is reddit after all, my hopes weren‚Äôt exactly high for most
Huh well dismissing comparing what ‚Äúgamers‚Äù are going through with someone close to you being diagnosed with cancer, which is disturbing and a tad insensitive, yes it is an issue that people only care about this from recent introduction of videogames into this socioeconomic clusterfuck. This is not an effective poise to render any sort of valuable social yield that would otherwise birth some sort of shift in the public consciousness which would hold the credence of an effective and established cause. Caring about injustices committed by an entire nation solely due to a card game and the redundant implications sprung forth by recent actions, lends itself to the notion that this is entirely impermanent and will ultimately surmise in involvement falling upon equivalencies of inaction. If you still didn‚Äôt see the problem with this whole conundrum to begin with, and still fail to see it now, I don‚Äôt know if this exchange is even of any value to you. Know that these are the types of inconclusive point-stimuli reactions that do nothing but bring us further away from achievement, and all amalgamate into a muddied soup of clashing inclinations to fester in the general collective. It‚Äôs a completely fucked way of approaching the complex issues of the present, and we wonder why we keep encountering situations of the like
Yeah like this cosplay of a protester.
> but this is reddit after all, my hopes weren‚Äôt exactly high for most

Damn, aren't you enlightened?
You are spending your time and energy on the wrong issue, these comments only bring attention to yourself and not the issue at hand. I'm not looking to get into an argument but I think you are missing the bigger picture. Although I'm no expert, I have study Mao Zedong's China and his policies, so I have some understanding of Chinese history. If I were to just randomly talk to a gamer about China any other day, they might not listen, but if I were to do the same today, they may be more inclined. Do you not see how that is a net positive? Wouldn't it benefit both you and the people you are trying to reach to be more constructive in your approach, rather than talk down to your audience?

I am a staunch environmentalist and supporter of animal rights, but most of the time people would not really hear me out. However, today's climate (literally/metaphorically), has made people more willing to listen. Instead of talking down to them and saying see, I told you this would happen, I tell them things they could do to make the situation better.
yah, this comment highlights that you are just a contrarian and are just trying to find something to diss the movement.

If you actually cared about chine you'd be happy that more and more people do, instead you act like a snob "i cared about china before it was cool". What, you lost your precious elite club and are now mad?

Because you are acting exactly like the idiots that stop liking a show/comic the moment it gets "popular"
nah, that‚Äôs just the nature of most internet collectives unfortunately. It‚Äôs not just reddit, these ideations tend to surface in literally every medium of online validation-based interaction. reddit is not necessarily worse than any other instances of this, but it‚Äôs certainly not better either
not surprising you think this, but not any less disappointing to hear

I‚Äôm glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family‚Äôs organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).

Right, when do we get a response? Today I hope.
Hey hey people
He's always been horrid and this proves it further.
Whelp, the Markets are about to open, and this will determin if ActiBlizz responds, if it drops though the floor they will have to give a statement to appease their shareholders.  If it doesn't then they will ignore it and pretend it never happened by sacking everyone that was near to the 'event' in question.

Should change it's name to Bobby Bootlick
Capitalism at its finest boys
He's a spineless greed infested piece of shit.
Hey hey people
The same pattern as last year's Diablo:Immoral shitstorm. 

They will first wait for the rage to settle by not saying anything to further fuel it, then run a vague statement through several departments and law firms, and in about a week from now they will come up with some empty PR blurb statement with some fake "understanding" about people's reaction but without committing to changing a single thing.
The mana cost should be a dollar sign
I get it 0 health because by banning the tournament winner he destroyed himself
Bobby Kotick supports Nazism
I see Blizzard's Wikipedia page was already updated, but I'm surprised no one has updated Kotick's.
 You gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China

I think it's very telling that Kotick, as a Jewish man, has not addressed the decision made by his company regarding the HK humanitarian crisis.
The tribe should be scum bag and the mana cost 11, the only way to discount it, is with China‚Äôs mobile market
They should give that kid his prize money back for starters.

Edgelord takes photo from reddit and reposts
Well, it will be like the usuals. Do nothing, let the things cool down and people will forget it and move on.
So basically you guys want to trash a game for not letting you hijack their platform for your political movement knowing that it will get them in trouble.

This is why nobody fucking wants politics in gaming.
If you‚Äôre posting this against your will, blink twice
1 they are evil crop

2 they learn from china, just dont reply to make it a cold action

they just want the discussion go down when days has gone
Just storm blizzcon with Hong Kong posters, even if security starts kicking out attendees cuz of that
Imagine planning what is perhaps the most exciting Blizzcon they've ever had. Diablo 4 will be announced, the next WoW expansion will be announced, hell, they might even announce whatever Overwatch related product they've been working on.

And then their stupid asses do something like this and everything is ruined. If videogame developers/publishers had feet.. well, they wouldn't have feet. Because those feet would have been shot so many times that they'd be gone.

So few companies seem to be able to just bring us some good news. They always need to do something to cast a pall over everything they do, and in this case, Blizzard went for one of the worst PR blunders ever. This shit is so bad that even my lazy and usually apathetic friends have expressed their disapproval towards this, and one of them is considering canceling his sub to WoW Classic.
I'm so excited to see it go down. They deserve it and any employee who hasn't put in their notice by then deserves to deal with the difficulties.
I hope people go there, but stay at the door, protesting for the whole duration, not one individual going inm kae their own party outside, celebrating freedom with each other.
I dunno if peoples fury will be as strong as it is now, in 3,5 weeks time. Had this all happened a few days before, good lord it would be glorious, but I suspect it'll blow a bit over by then =(
Hey hey, people...
I always thought it was Joel Osteen.
There's a company-wide shortest straw drawing for who is gonna do the press release.
Weird ass crypto shit though. No one wants to touch that.
It's still only 9am on the West Coast.  Imagine being a fly on the wall of those offices!
Wait... a repost? On Reddit?? That certainly can't be true. That's never happened before. Ever!
yeah that was the initial statement they made before the large backlash and before the news got wind of it.
Not being political would be taking no action.  Banning the player and casters and taking his winnings is an extremely political thing to do.
The act of banning the player and confiscating all his earnings is in itself a political act
the world is political, money is political. You can't be in bed with other governments and avoid politics.
They were just trying to make as much money as possible and fuck whoever gets hurt by it.
yeah seems like it. but then again they could have just quickly gone back and let the guy have his prize once there was a backlash. seems like the best way to end this
Commenting on Reddit is? I'm sure the people would be ok with you seeing a movie and say #firebobby later
They already removed his eyes for donation.
They can't stop them all. People just need to Naruto run to evade the security guards.
this whole thing will blow over by then. internet social justice crusaders are pathetic, all of these people "boycotting" blizzard will buy diablo 4 and then post on reddit how amazing it is.
Don't get upset with developers. They have families and need to take care of them. They may not agree but they aren't going to lose their jobs just to make a statement.
Guess what. It won't. Even their stock slightly recovered today. And i wouldn't wonder if not even 1000 people that claimed to boycott them quitted everything.
No. I'm pissed at blizzard as well, but no. It's the ceo, not the employees who are at fault. Don't make the workers suffer.
Yeah how about you start the charge by quitting  your job. See how much you'll do punish China for being shit.  Don't use anything made that was made in China.  Quit your job in protest. See how much of a difference you'll make.  Chances are you'll just be replaced by someone willing to work.
Not that weird. You just actually own the cards you open in game.

You can trade them to other players, or just outright sell them.
Nothing weird about ethereum.
They are probably in complete melt down, between people canceling their pre orders, wow subs or deleting their battlenet altogether on one side, and blizzard/Hong Kong memes getting upvoted to the front page and likely creeping up where China will take notice on another.
Actually, I'm sure it's completely and utterly silent. The only thing you'll hear there today is the nervous shuffling of people living in fear. Because everyone with principles has already left.
It's a pretty severe punishment. Could have suspended him for a week, could have issued a warning.
He doesn't need eyes to sing praises.
Also use kagebunshin jutsu to overwhelm the guards
Your pessimism is not unfounded, but personally I am more optimistic about things like this. I'd rather hope for the best than expect the worst. And calling people who are willing to show their disapproval pathetic isn't helping anyone.
Just doing your job isnt a valid excuse for human rights violations.
Of course none of this is their direct fault but let's not act like this wouldn't be highly educated and talented people working for an industry leader. 

Everyone with Blizzard in their CV will be fine. Even when the ship's finally sinking, they'll float.
Well then they are shitheads just like the nazis who weren't about to lose their jobs just to make a statement.
That just means they made the same decision blizzard did. That money is more important than human rights. They don't get a pass.
developers do ok in the labor market these days, perhaps you're unaware
Don't get upset with organ harvesters. They have families and need to take care of them.
Fuck that mentality. It is the people working for them that make everything they do possible. If you know your employer is evil and you keep workin g for them, ***you are evil***. It‚Äôs ***literally*** the same thing Blizzard is doing... willingly doing unethical things in exchange for money. You‚Äôre a hoe just like Blizzard, you‚Äôre just a much cheaper hoe.
Wow. As someome that quit hearthstone because p2w and lack of trading in a TRADING CARD GAME this actually seems like a good alternative outside of the political motivation
Putting everything on a blockchain was dumb in 2017 and it didnt age well. Its stupid and the creepy factor of being associated with the crime laden scams and ponzis etc that anything crypto is mired in doesnt help. Also the crypto cultists on reddit is extremely offputting.
Except the games extremely hard to actually start playing if you have no experience with block chain stuff
Well we already saw that crowd of Blizzard employees out front by the statue with umbrellas in solidarity
well im sure u wouldnt like to be homeless just cus u support something, right? Boycott Blizzard, do not hurt the workers that have no other choices.
Doing your job as a game developer or support staff does *not* mean you are violating human rights. That is a massive mental leap that cannot be made reasonably.
Survival is more of a priority than big world issues... If ppl were well fed and less anxious about their personal finances, they would focus on bigger issues like human rights and global warming.
Everyone? You must not work in the industry. If you're a "rockstar" dev in your 20s/30s you might easily get a job outside of the gaming industry, but to stay in the gaming industry is ultra competitive, overworked and underpaid for their talent levels.
Well i guess you're about to destroy everything you own that has contributed money into the Chinese economy? Blizzard is a big company with thousands of employees that does not have the luxury of getting by while finding another job because of bad decisions their employer made.   


This have absolutely nothing to do with nazis, but if we are being frank most "Nazis" during ww2 were just regular germans trying to survive (and thus not prosecuted after the war). 

Idiot.
You‚Äôre differently takening it too far
Not that I support people continuing to work for blizzard but this is idneed true, most have a family to maintain at home. Would you leave your job and put your family in a potential crisisfor this? If yes then I assume you do not have a family yet.

And no, Blizzard workers are not to be compared to the nazis, I don't see how the developers are in anyway behaving like nazis at this point, there are many signs that most of them do **not** support this decision.
The devs are not the higher ups, THEY HAVE NO SAY IN THIS. You wouldn't quit your job and put your family at risk just because the higher ups did something you don't agree with.

This is as game development job, these thing aren't easy to find.
This *just* happened.  How do you, and everyone else dumping on Blizzard devs, know that at least some of them aren't looking for new employment right now?  These things take time, even for experienced devs (I'm one), and are not always a slam-dunk.
What a shitty fucking take. Also a completely false equivalence. Don't blame this on the employees, they are regular human beings trying to get by. They have no control over what bad decisions the management do and often not the luxury of just finding another job.
Tumblr is leaking I see.
Some people are getting mad about the selling aspect.

But name a card game you can‚Äôt do that for irl
You okay?

I just like their marketing.
They never advertised it as an easy game to get into?

Sounds like you‚Äôre comparing apples to oranges.
Actually I haven't - was that in this sub?  

And, of course, I comment with hyperbole. I honestly do not expect employees to leave en masse. After all, if they have a chance to fix things, that is, by far, the better option.   

But there is some truth... it was only a few months ago that everyone who fought against the removal of the "bonus" system wound up retiring or moving on.
Fuck them for supporting a communist state's will with their labor. Find a new job.
You dont seem to get it.

Companies are not people. Everyone involved is to and has to be held accountable. By being afraid of losing their jobs, they're, quite simply, enabling the process.

Just like we, as consumers,  can do our part by not giving Blizzard money. Unless you're afraid of losing the 10+ years you put into WoW, then you're just another cog in the problem machine.

The developers will get hurt if we dont pay their company, and they'd be out of a job anyways when they start downsizing. Again.

And for all the 'fine' folks who responded to me, who're willing to put up with this sort of bullshit and tyranny for the sake of 'fuck muh freedoms, I need muh job'  


[Crossposting from r/news](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfn3yi/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/)  


There are Blizzard employees that have more spine than you.  Good on them.  Fuck Blizzard.
Ah yes, these talented people in their well paying jobs have no savings to fall back on or any skills in demand in the industry.

Fuck the workers, they are supporting this shit just as much as anyone else in the company.
I'd love to see how many of these armchair warriors playing the blame game would take a leaf out of their own book and do what they are expecting of the Blizzard staff (most of whom have very fucking little to do with this decision). My guess approximates to roughly *zero*.
These developers won't go hungry. These are high demand skill sets, and unless they are entirely incompetent when it comes to money then they should have at least several months worth of savings and thats plenty of time to find new work at a place with less human rights violations as part of their day to day operations.
> but to stay in the gaming industry is ultra competitive, overworked and underpaid for their talent levels.

And? Should I feel sorry now for the people who hypothetically couldn't work in the most greedy and manipulative industry anymore if they wanted to take a stand against human rights vioations? 

Sorry, I don't.
That's such an invalid argument that's being thrown around.  How does destroying a product that has already been fully paid for do anything?

Refusing to **continue** to support and pay for products does make a difference.
No, I am not a racist. I don‚Äôt have anything against Chinese people or Chinese companies. It‚Äôs utterly astounding how difficult that seems to be for people to understand. You are a racist bigot.
> Blizzard is a big company with thousands of employees that does not have the luxury of getting by while finding another job because of bad decisions their employer made.

Blizzard is an industry leader and only hires highly educated or talented people. They are working in a booming industry, in one of the richest countries in the world. 

Noone currently working at Blizzard will have a problem finding another job somewhere else in case shit will hit the fan (if it hasn't already).
He's not though.
Yeah this sub is just a big joke.
Yes I would quit my job if I worked for Blizzard right now. No question. My money is absolutely where my mouth is. Fuck any employee who keeps working for Blizzard. They are knowingly doing evil things for an evil company just for a bit of money.
Just doing your job isnt an excuse to commit human rights violations.
Yea some of these comments are bad jokes and you can tell they are made from people living in their mother's basement. Having people quit their careers that they spent decades building over a player suspension is a bad joke. If China literally oozied this player into the ground then sure, but he just got suspended.The playerbase needs to respond to this act. The developers are professionals, I'm pretty sure they are making their voice heard privately but aren't going to destroy their lives over something like this.
I mean a Blizzard employee covered the "every voice matters" carving that is a part of the statue located in front of Blizzard HQ.

So I guess not all of them are bad.
I'm just saying it's overly complicated just to try to play it which is saddening
Just curious, what exactly do you do for a living?
You never were in vidya game industry, were you? If u get a job, you've won in life. its not like corpo work or anything else
Such an easy sentiment to have when it's not your livelihood on the line. I'm willing to bet a year's paycheck that 90% of people demanding the employees do something would bitch out if they were in that situation.
So what you're implying is that because somebody who has a wife/husband, children, a house, a car, bills.. A LIFE! That they should just up and quit their job and leave a company because a group of shareholders made horrible choices? That they should uproot everything they've worked for because of other peoples decisions? That they should jeopardize their lives to make a statement to a company that PROBABLY doesn't give a shit that they're resigning anyways because, let's face it, they can hire a new employee to fill their shoes in a heartbeat?

&#x200B;

Stop white knighting dude when YOU clearly don't get it.
Human lives seem to lose value among the most ardent idealists.
If every good person quit, what would be left? What possibility for change would there be at that point?
Out of curiosity, what car are u driving if u have one and what phone do u have?
Guilty by association? That's a bit ridiculous. I can say with certainty that most of the employees at Blizzard had no say, or no pull, when it came to the decisions made regarding this issue. 

&#x200B;

As somebody who works in network security for a large company, my company has made many decisions that resulted in people being fired or  sued that had left me completely baffled that I also had absolutely no say in. So judging by your example I'm just as guilty as those people? That's fucking ignorant lmfao.
Wow. What fantasy world do you live in? I work for a company I fundamentally disagree with as do many people because job transitions are not as easy as you make it out to be. Holy shit. I cannot stand idealistic assholes willing to shatter the livelihoods of real ppl. This goes for movement purists who think rioters should be sinless saints and for the other side of the spectrum where ppl should give up their cashflows and means of living for their families over something like this. This is up to the individual. And families will always come first.
Those developers dont have any say in these political games. They are where they are because they have a love and passion for video games and are striving to make the games the best they can be. Why else are they wasting their time in an ultra competitive field with poor job security, inconsistent pay and insane hours?

Fuck China but dont let your hatred blind you to the fact that these are people too.
I know this many be difficult to understand, but blizzard is not run by 1 guy. There are thousands of employee's who have no effect on the political agenda of the company. Many are just there to get a pay check to feed families. 

So for you to automatically assume that everybody who works there is some how apart of this "Greedy and Manipulative Industry" is a little ignorant. Not everybody is just going to drop what they're doing and risk their livelihood for other people. It would be silly to ask them to do so. It's a nice thought to idealize towards, but it doesn't work in reality. 

Also, you do realize that almost every industry in one way or another has violated human rights in one way or another?  I highly doubt your'e boycotting your soap distributor because they used it on animals first, or boycotting your local McDonalds because it takes 660 gallons of water to make a single hamburger. 

and,

Generally the main goal of any business is to acquire as much money as possisble, as fast as possible. So in a sense, the majority of all businesses are greedy. Blizzard is no less greedy than any other company. They just got caught selling their virtues out in the open, usually companies do that stuff in private, so they don't get as much negative press.
While i agree that the argument itself is shit, it's about as stupid as putting the blame on the employees. We as customers have the luxury of voting with our wallets, and so we should. Cancel your Blizzard subscriptions, spread the memes, I'm all for it. 

But an employee may not have the benefit of being able to survive by quitting their jobs to make a moral statement though. It is not their battle to take.
That is crazy ignorant and not how the world works. First of all, your assessment is not true. Blizzard is not made up of developers (who may and not may not be highly educated), but also customers service reps, sales people, office clerks, pr reps, designers, tech supporters etc. etc. There are lots of employees going paycheck to paycheck who's life would literally fall apart having to switch jobs on a moments notice.

Secondly, even a "highly educated" person may find themselves having difficulties finding a new job quick. I'm what you would call "highly educated" in one of the richest Scandinavian counties in the world, but it would be very, very inconvenient for me if i were to quit my job today. And then I'm one of the lucky ones  because i actually have some savings.

Once again, it's not up to the employees to fight the battles of their employers.
Working on a game is a lot different to " committing human rights violations " brother. Like what, should the entirety of Germany have just laid down to die in WWII? You know, because working in a bakery in germany is committing human rights violations because of the nazis. While we're at it I guess all of the inhabitants in the countries that supported Germany should've done the same according to your logic /shrug
Well, as of now while the game is still in Beta
Another thing is that working for Blizzard is likely a dream job for a large majority of the employees there. Many people have struggled really hard to land a job in that company and will likely never leave unless forced. Also, is just plainly really hard to get a job in the video game industry. A lot of people might be holding out hope that the company will come to its senses and go back to how it used to be, even though that will probably never happen.
Anybody that thinks Blizzard employees should quit their jobs over this probably live with their parents and never had to work for a living. Don't mind them. They are probably kids. At least I hope so.
Shitty games made by Blizzard, which is where things are going anyways.  The developers will go to other companies, or start their own and return to making good games by gamers, rather than for corporate interests (I.E. Lootboxes, Microtransactions, etc).

Some companies are beyond change, you can see it in how they act.  Blizzard stepped over that line finally and joined the ranks of EA.  Unlike EA, they don't have a monopoly on any type of game.
Got em
Ah great to hear your family's comfort matters more than the struggle of an entire population. You dont have to work where you do, you chose that. You choose to support shitty companys that dont give a fuck about human rights as they bleed the working class dry.
> Why else are they wasting their time in an ultra competitive field with poor job security, inconsistent pay and insane hours

Blizzard pays above industry average and has no crazy crunch culture going on. 

If your passion is with video games you should maybe try to work for a company with a matching passion. 

Blizzard hasn't released a new game since 2016, and their most successful game is a relaunch of a 15 year old game. Blizzard doesn't care about games, they care about monetization.
> So for you to automatically assume that everybody who works there is some how apart of this "Greedy and Manipulative Industry" is a little ignorant.

How so? They are quite literally part of it. Nobody in the history of modern western societies was ever forced to work for a corporation they deemed immoral or unethical. Yet, a lot of people do it voluntarily.

> Not everybody is just going to drop what they're doing and risk their livelihood for other people.

Nobody working for an industry leading company in a booming industry in one of the richest countries on earth is risking their "livelihood".

The people in Hong Kong though, they do. Quite literally, and almost daily.
I agree that the dude you were replying to is stupid to equate Blizzard employees to Nazis. 

I personally have uninstalled all Blizzard games and ended my sub to wow. I will be making informed decisions on my purchases here on out. 

I have also emailed my state representatives in the hopes that they will voice their concerns and act upon it.
> but it would be very, very inconvenient for me if i were to quit my job today.

Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that you would be inconvenienced. 

I think the people being imprisoned in Chinese concentration camps because of nothing but their religion, or slaves who have their organs harvested for the Chinese elite class, or citizens thrown in prison for life for speaking their minds, could also be mildly inconvenienced by their situations. 

But you're right, let's protect a corporation bending the knee to an inhumane regime, so noone gets accidentally inconvenienced. 

Thank you for your perspective and compassion, you're making the first world a better place!
No one says they have to work there making games. Hell these people could quit their jobs today and not be working for a company that has china way of thinking. Oh no your family might go through a bit of a hard time, but if youre not incompetent you have a few months worth of savings and will find new work. But no wouldnt want anyone to be uncomfortable with the new Chinese overlords, best to just keep working it doesnt matter that youre sucking china dick.
So that's the reason I can't login?
Canceled all my accounts today. Uninstalling the blizzard app. Fuck that behavior. If Blizzard wants to suck Chinese dick for money, they better get comfortable for the long haul, because they're not getting more of my money.

 Id definitely quit my job if my employer pulled this shit, btw. And I work in the labs are a major pharmaceutical manufacturer.... Jobs are easy to replace. Human lives are not.
Lmao. You sound like an entitled brat tbh.
My point is, you're dragging low level developers into this who dont really deserve the hate. You sound like it's so easy to just switch jobs at a whim when the studio you work for makes unfavorable decisions. I don't doubt that blizzard employees right now are beginning to look for a different job. It's been 1 fucking day, do you seriously think they'll just find another job immediately?

Speaking as someone who works in the fucking industry, calm the fuck down. Theres literally no reason to get upset over lower level developers who just want to make video games. Criticize blizzard, cancel your subs and stop playing their games, but why would you waste your time trying to bash on the developers? Like I said. It's been a single day, do you seriously expect any blizzard employee to already have a new job?
How many games should company release every 3 years? 10? 20? For example, GTA5 was released in 2013, whilst RDR2 was released in 2018. That\`s 5 years total. Is it a bad company?
Being apart of something doesn't make you automatically held responsible for the whole thing.

Do you blame the soldier who is apart of the war? No, you blame the person giving him the commands, the general or authority figure. Blaming the solider is pointless because they have no say over their situation.

This is very similar, the employee's had no input on the actions that took place, so to hold them responsible for the actions that their superior's made is unfair for the employee's. Nothing they could have done would have changed the outcome that happened. This is why they are innocent.

These employee's cannot also be asked to quit their jobs on the spot because you feel it to be right. Many have mortgages, bills, and daily living expenses. Not everybody has the luxury of quitting their job on the spot. Just because they're in the richest countries in the world, doesn't automatically make them rich people. 

What you should be suggesting be done is the person who was in charge of the decision gets fired. There is no reason for more people to get hurt. Only those who deserve it. 

In an ideal world, it would be nice if everybody grouped up against injustice, but in reality it doesn't always play out that way.
Wow, talk about citing things out of context to win an argument. I am not advocating for the horrific crimes against humanity made by the Chinese government, but i think you know that by arguing in bad faith.

I'm saying that battle is not the responsibility of the employees of Blizzard. If they have the ability to quit to make a statement and find new job, thats great! But if they're not able to, it's not fair to berate them for it.
It's really easy to say that when it's not your family.
> Oh no your family might go through a bit of a hard time

"Sorry you can't eat today. Daddy needs to take a political stand even though I'm a tech support rep and not a high level decision maker."
All talk. And  a big pharma job? LOL Do you even know what you represent since you're all high and mighty about what people do with their jobs? Start packing up now.
Lol I see youve run out of arguments so youre just attacking me directly. Good debate, seems we are done here.
> I don't doubt that blizzard employees right now are beginning to look for a different job. It's been 1 fucking day, do you seriously think they'll just find another job immediately?

It's not been one day. Blizzard shitting on the western market to cater to the Chinese mobile crap market is a trend that's been visible for the public for exactly one year, probably even longer internally. 

I've never said that they should or need to find another job right away, my point is more that most people, including those virtue signaling umbrella peeps on social media, won't even look for a new job out of sheer convenience or indifference. 

> Like I said. It's been a single day, do you seriously expect any blizzard employee to already have a new job?

No, and I've never said anything like that. But I guarantee you that in 3 months from now the people in this *"Hey let's cover up the statue for social media points!"* picture will most likely all still be working at Blizzard.

> Speaking as someone who works in the fucking industry, calm the fuck down.

Speaking as someone who has worked in this industry for 7 years, I am perfectly calm.
How many IPs does Rockstar actively maintain compared to Blizzard? Yeah, that's exactly where your argument falls apart.
> Do you blame the soldier who is apart of the war?

Of course I do, lol. You can't just apply for a position as soldier, even sign up for deployment abroad, and then you're automatically freed from any and all moral responsibility just because someone is giving you orders. 

Are you seriously believing what you're writing there? I mean how gullible are people in your eyes? Do we even have free will or smth like that?

> These employee's cannot also be asked to quit their jobs on the spot because you feel it to be right.

Which is why I've never did anything like that. Like who are you even talking to, you're apparently speaking with someone I can't see or hear. 

> Just because they're in the richest countries in the world, doesn't automatically make them rich people.

Again, a total straw man that noone ever said. It does however make them privileged enough to be in the position to apply for new jobs.

> What you should be suggesting be done is the person who was in charge of the decision gets fired. There is no reason for more people to get hurt. Only those who deserve it.

I'm not asking anyone to get hurt so please cut back on the dramatization in your rhetoric a little. 

> In an ideal world, it would be nice if everybody grouped up against injustice, but in reality it doesn't always play out that way.

Of course not because most people value convenience, money, and security higher than integrity or human rights violations at the other end of the world.
Yes though, you ***are*** advocating for those things. You are *clearly* advocating that the people responsible for it just keep doing it.

That‚Äôs what it means when the company you work for is doing evil. Companies aren‚Äôt independent entities, they are made up of individuals that actually carry out the actions without whom there is no evil. That‚Äôs it. A bunch of individuals making individual decisions to continue helping evil.

Which you are clearly here advocating they continue doing in order to avoid inconvenience.

I guess it‚Äôs hard for a collectivist racist such as yourself to grasp the concept, but companies are just a bunch of individuals doing individual things and nothing stops until the individuals stop.
Nothing's taken out of context. If your employer supports a regime like this by catering to them to the point of firing unpleasant casters, you indirectly support these actions. 

Covering a statue is a nice act of virtue signaling but if you still offer your labor force to this corporation you are complicit in supporting the regime, whether you want to or not. 

> But if they're not it aint fair to berate them for it.

We all have different standards for integrity it seems.
So its fine to support human rights violations as long as your family is comfortable?
Bullshit dishonest argument. It‚Äôs obviously possible to get a new job without your kids going hungry.
If your job youre at is the only job you think you can get youre not qualified to be leading a family. Youre not even willing to think of slightly lowering your luxury bubble to think about the world around you.
Enjoy your job at blizzard. Hope you enjoy all those yen.
You have to be even more deluded than I thought of you assumed this was ever a ‚Äùdebate.‚Äù Spoken like a fresh college grad who never held a job or doesn‚Äôt understand what responsibility looks like. Honestly am embarrassed for you. ‚úåÔ∏è
Based off of your original comment, you're not very calm. Doesnt seem like anything I say makes sense to you, and all you're doing is for some reason getting upset at the wrong people. Your hatred for blizzard and its employees runs deep for whatever reason so I'm just gonna let you sit in it. 

>wont even look for a job out of sheer convenience or indifference

How about you and I actually do something about this issue rather than comment on the internet? Oh wait, you wont out of sheer convenience or indifference.

Have a nice day friend.
I don't know. How many?
You do realize that not everybody is a volunteer for war right? Many people are forced into war due to their circumstances, and no not everybody has free will to make all the free choices they want. 

I'm also not saying your completely free from moral responsibilities if you go to war. If you commit atrocities, like murder or rape then your guilty of these crimes, but trying to hold men morally responsible who were simply following orders is not accurately allocating the blame on those who actually deserve it. You would put this burden on the one's giving the orders, not the one's receiving them. 

You gave the implication of those who are working under the "Greedy and Manipulative" Gaming industry are some how doing something wrong when it couldn't be further from the truth. 

And I agree with you, most people do value convenience, money, and security higher than integrity or human rights violations on the other side of the world. It's a shame, but a lot of us are ethnocentric and the majority do not have the means to be otherwise.
I think you are just trolling at this point, but that is a very simplified view of how a corporation work. Decision making isn't made by some 20 year old tech support rep, it's made by the management. Calling everyone racist is not really helping your case, and honestly - i don't see the racism in here. No one is hating on Chinese people, they are hating on the Chinese government.
Erm, your whole reply was citing of context, but sure.

I am very happy that you're so privileged that you're able to make a moral statement by quitting your job. I have friends and co-workers that would end up homeless if they made such an action.

But i guess you're right in that fuck all the people trying to provide for their families, they should absolutely put their kids on the street by prioritizing the moral high ground.
I get what your saying, I do agree that continuing to work somewhere that has horrible values, you are contributing. However, I can understand if someone is living paycheck to paycheck, they can't just quit right away.. But it's time for them to find new jobs and get out.
Just curious, do you apply your tegridy standarts to citizenship as well or only to occupation?

As in, if your country commits atrocities and you still live and pay taxes there although you can leave, do you share the responcibility to the same degree as with job?
My family > People a million miles away I don't know and will never know. So yes.
Get another job lined up before you quit. To just quit and not have things like a paycheck and health insurance (one of the reasons having insurance tied to your employer in this country is bullshit) lined up is irresponsible if you have a family. I am not saying they shouldn't quit if they feel the company's principles and their own don't line up, but there are not many safety nets for people living paycheck to paycheck.  What about people that have a dependent with a pre-existing medical condition? Are they supposed to just up and quit without health insurance? It's easy to virtue signal and tell people what to do if you're not the person in the situation.
> Based off of your original comment, you're not very calm. Doesnt seem like anything I say makes sense to you, and all you're doing is for some reason getting upset at the wrong people. Your hatred for blizzard and its employees runs deep for whatever reason so I'm just gonna let you sit in it.

Ah, the good old mind reader argument of *"No, I know better what you actually are!"* - quite impressive.

> Your hatred for blizzard and its employees runs deep for whatever reason so I'm just gonna let you sit in it.

I don't hate their employees, I just think they're hypocrites if they plan to keep working there. 

> How about you and I actually do something about this issue rather than comment on the internet? Oh wait, you wont out of sheer convenience or indifference.

I pass the Chinese embassy daily on my work to work here, and I took part in 2 protests already. 

Your contribution so far? 

Have a nice day as well, and we're not friends.
Then educate yourself and come back later. See you around.
> You do realize that not everybody is a volunteer for war right? Many people are forced into war due to their circumstances, and no not everybody has free will to make all the free choices they want.

Most western countries have moved away from a conscription model, so yes, by the very definition it is completely voluntary to sign up for military and combat.

And I highly doubt that there are scenarios where someone could not find ANY other job than joining the army etc. That's nonsense. 

> but trying to hold men morally responsible who were simply following orders is not accurately allocating the blame on those who actually deserve it

Of course the people calling the shots are also morally responsible, to a much bigger extent even. But if you pull the trigger you're making a conscious decision to take someone's life. Of course we created laws to avoid soldiers being legally accountable for every kill, but morally speaking you are absolutely responsible for pulling that trigger and ending a life.

> You gave the implication of those who are working under the "Greedy and Manipulative" Gaming industry are some how doing something wrong when it couldn't be further from the truth.

I'm not saying anything like that, I'm just saying you can't have your cake and eat it too. If you're working for Blizzard with all the benefits coming with it, you can't just post a picture on Twitter and pretend to stand with Hong Kong. Or at least I won't buy into it because I think it's as hypocritical as it gets.

Side note, here's the official apology from Blizzard to China, as posted on Weibo (basically Chinese Twitter) and translated: https://imgur.com/a/OGyZvO4

If you're not appalled by that as a Blizzard employee, then you've truly lost any integrity.
lol put their kids on the street ...sry, I can't really take you serious anymore with all that hyperbole. 

Have a great first world life.
I‚Äôm not priveleged at all, but the fact that you use that term suggests to me that you have never seen a bit of adversity in your life. Which goes a long way to why you think a couple weeks of ramen is worse than directly materially supporting an outright and openly evil regime.
I've actually never said that anyone should quit right away, that would be overly dramatic nonsense. 

But yeah, if you want change, then try to find a new job. Covering a statue won't do much beyond social media points.
> As in, if your country commits atrocities and you still live and pay taxes there although you can leave, do you share the responcibility to the same degree as with job?

No, because a western country is usually a democracy that you can change from within by either becoming active yourself or simply with your vote. 

Companies aren't democratic which is why integrity doesn't leave you with many choices. 

Nice try though, 3/10.
Good to know you have no savings and no skills that you can use to find a new job. Maybe now is a good time for some self reflection?
You actually have no idea what my situation is and are speaking out your ass when you claim I am virtue signalling. I assure you my money is where my mouth is.
>Ah, the good old mind reader argument of "No, I know better what you actually are!" - quite impressive.

Sorry don't understand this, english not good enough but not really sure what your point is here.

>I don't hate their employees, I just think they're hypocrites if they plan to keep working there.

yes of course, it's easy to just switch jobs on a whim. Blizzard is damn good for your resume and I'm sure plenty of talented programmers can easily move along just fine, but what about everyone else in more volatile positions? I don't know, you tell me.

>I pass the Chinese embassy daily on my work to work here, and I took part in 2 protests already.

Good for you, I retract my previous statement. Of course I'm assuming you also don't use apple products, only eat locally grown non-imported produce and work for a studio that has no market in China whatsoever? Surely you aren't a hypocrite either.

>Your contribution so far?

Talking to you apparently

>Have a nice day as well, and we're not friends.

Yes we are.

Anyways, doesn't seem like I'm getting through to you so I guess there's no point in going further with this. I won't bother wasting time reading your responses, I think we're both just better off going about our days. :)
So, you don't know that as well. And, I suppose, you don't know what IPs are. But that doesn't matter, because your initial point was about number of games per years
I mean, honestly - I don't get why it's so fucking hard to understand why everybody at blizzard is not "highly educated skilled people" and why they can't just "quit their jobs". 

You're trying to make me the privileged one, but if you think it's that easy the only one with such values are you.

But i wish you a great life as well!
I grew up with lots of love, but we couldn't afford to two slices of ham on our sandwiches. I know about being poor. What the fuck do you know about me?

Your post history suggests you own pretty recent apple products if you use IOS 13 btw, so i guess you know something about directly supporting china.
Thinking average citizen has more potential influence over the country than an average employer over a company is on negatives out of 10 but ok.
One day I'll take advice from Galaxy Brains on Reddit possibly. But that day is not today.
What money?
> I think we're both just better off going about our days. :)

absolutely. Cheers
> because your initial point was about number of games per years

Yes, at Blizzard. Your whataboutism bores me by the way, have a good one.
> I don't get why it's so fucking hard to understand why everybody at blizzard is not "highly educated skilled people" and why they can't just "quit their jobs".

Everybody can, all of the time. It's a choice, and sometimes an inconvenient one by your own words.

You are valuing jobs in the tech industry higher than human rights, that's the very simple explanation and demonstration of your first world privilege.
> What the fuck do you know about me?

Just that you think it's appropriate for employees of evil to continue doing evil because it brings the paycheck in.

How can you even claim to be against what Blizzard is doing? You realize it's THE SAME FUCKING THING right? You are excusing the employees for doing THE SAME THING but for a much lower price.
>  i guess you know something about directly supporting china.

You're clearly a fucking racist piece of shit. Just get out of my sight.
*employee
Ah yes, having a savings of 6 months worth of bills and teaching yourself a new skill, sounds like terrible advice to me.

Dont crush yourself under that heavy brain buddy.
No. I just said that 1 game in 3 years is pretty average result for gaming industry for a new AAA game. That's not slow at all. Rockstar games was just an example. And you're trying to reduce merit of blizzard development team for no reason.
ah yes, another day, another sub, another one-sided argument by you. i'm almost impressed at this point how you seem to just constantly be in an argumentative state with anyone over anything, each day, with almost every thing you comment on.. idk if that takes skill, or you're just a really terrible person and everyone in your life must just tolerate you whenever you're around.
You are constantly argumenting on the premise that everybody at Blizzard will easily be able to find a new job due to being in the "tech industry" and being "highly educated". That is just factually not true. Blizzard has lots and lots of employees doing "non-skilled" jobs. 

Second of all, you're really clinging to the word "inconvenience". I was not using that word in the context you're implying, i was wording it in a way that i am aware that i am privileged actually being able to survive a few months by having savings. That is not true for most people, especially when working in a field where the pay just covers rent and necessities (which is the case for most tech-support/sales/customer service reps). 

It's not a choice if you have to choose between rent and moral integrity in matters such as this .
> And you're trying to reduce merit of blizzard development team for no reason.

I told you the reason: They're not releasing new games anymore. 

When is the next game scheduled for release? Oh right, they haven't even announced a goddamn thing, so probably another 2-3 years away. At least.
> Blizzard has lots and lots of employees doing "non-skilled" jobs.

And those non skilled jobs also exist in other companies, even in the same industry sector. And then it's still a solid foundation to have worked for an industry leading company. 

> It's not a choice if you have to choose between rent and moral integrity in matters such as this .

Actually it is, it's only difficult if you desperately want to live in California or some other metropolitan area with insane rents. 

So yeah, sunshine state vs. human rights and integrity....tough call indeed.
Boiling down your arguments to "sunshine state vs human rights" is so disingenuous i don't even know where to start. It's much more complicated than that which shouldn't be to difficult to understand. You can't afford to have integrity if you have to choose between life necessities and your job. If you're poor it doesn't matter if you're living in the "sunshine state" or Beijing. You have a solid chance of ending up homeless nonetheless. Furthermore, if you already made a life in a meteropolitan area it's not a matter of just pack up your shit and leave. Try to put yourself in other peoples shoes. It's tough shit for the people of Hong Kong and the citizens of China but in a world where practically everything is contributing to china in one way or another you are not able to make such a choice unless you really have to means to. It's blatantly obvious you're either trolling or to privileged to understand.

Nobody working for an industry leading company in California is poor, period.

> but in a world where practically everything is contributing to china in one way or another you are not able to make such a choice unless you really have to means to.

Solid whataboutism mixed with a vague claim, I like it. 

Everybody can get a new job. Maybe not today, not tomorrow, but everybody can work towards that. 

My point is: Most people won't even try because integrity is something that you only display in facebook posts or on Twitter... or Reddit. 

And before you ask, yes, I have walked away from 2 well paid jobs in my life for ethical reasons, and I'm doing absolutely fine.
>Nobody working for an industry leading company in California is poor, period.

This is just not true. You know nothing of customer rep #42:s economic horse powers.

>Everybody can get a new job. Maybe not today, not tomorrow, but everybody can work towards that.

This i agree with, but now you're moving goal posts. 

>And before you ask, yes, I have walked away from 2 well paid jobs in my life for ethical reasons, and I'm doing absolutely fine.

Thats great man, but thats not an option for everybody.

It's just very ignorant to assume that everybody have the means to walk away from a job for ethical reasons. That is just not the case. I mean, if you can, once again - good.

But If you can't, thats fine to as long as you're aware of it and do your best to change your life situation.
> This is just not true. You know nothing of customer rep #42:s economic horse powers.

I do know that Blizzard's customer support is located in Ireland and France, not in California. 

> Thats great man, but thats not an option for everybody.

It is, it's just more difficult, let's say if you have children for example. But you absolutely can write applications and at least give it a shot. But most people won't, and that's my whole point.
I have absolutely no doubt in my mind you would‚Äôve made excuses for nazis in WW2. It‚Äôs just clear as day, this is literally the *exact* same situation.

You disgust me.
Jesus christ, i‚Äôm not making excuses for Blizzard you dense motherfucker. A goddamn service rep in Paris is not responsible for Winnie the Poo suppressing the people of Hong Kong. If they can switch jobs then thats great but they are slaves under the hamster wheel as much as the rest of us.

Get a reality check, fucking hell.
> A goddamn service rep in Paris is not responsible for Winnie the Poo suppressing the people of Hong Kong.

Yeah, they are. You're living in an alternate fucking universe. If everyone stopped working for Blizzard, THERE WOULD BE NO MORE BLIZZARD.

> they are slaves

Not even remotely close. You obviously have a really poor grasp of history if you think modern employment in a first world country is comparable to slavery. Sit down and shut up.
Yeah, okay dude now i'm sure you're trolling. Your entire post history is "shithead, fuckhead, racist that". If not, you seem like a very ignorant angry man. How am i the racist one if you clearly supports the same regime by using apple products and playing Wow? Erasing your account today doesn't absolve you of liabilty, the Chinese government were doing crimes against humanity a long time ago and suppressing the people of Hong Kong months ago.

And i didn't call them slaves, i called them slaves under the hamster wheel, don't make arguments in bad faith.
> How am i the racist one if you clearly supports the same regime by using apple products and playing Wow?

I'm inclined to think you are the one who is trolling here.

Do you *seriously* have difficulty seeing the difference between the evil, anti-human actions of the Chinese Government and simply being a company that happens to be Chinese? If you can't see that difference, it means you're a racist. An ***extreme*** one.

There is nothing wrong with something just because it was made in China! That is not a thing! Your assumption that it is a thing is what makes you a racist.

> slaves, i called them slaves under the hamster wheel, don't make arguments in bad faith.

You've *got* to be kidding me. Buy a fucking mirror, asshole.
>Do you *seriously* have difficulty seeing the difference between the evil, anti-human actions of the Chinese Government and simply being a company that happens to be Chinese? If you can't see that difference, it means you're a racist. An ***extreme*** one. 

But apple is not a Chinese company. They are an American company who just today got backslash for removing the Taiwanese flag, therefore directly supporing the anti-human actions of the government the exakt same way Blizzard did today.

&#x200B;

And yes, you're the one putting words in my mouth.
No, the words came out of your mouth.

I'm done with this tried conversation. You are an intellectually dishonest racist. Your opinion doesn't matter anyway.

Blocked.
Not even bothering to enforce your assertion? You didn't know that apple wasnt a Chinese company right?

Haha, but yes it's easier to silence opponents then actually replaying to their arguments. Hm, it sounds exactly like something else...

They are advised to move behind her barrier.
Reaper has a grudge against an organization that acted like global enforcers, resorting to military force when needed, and then left him to die when it was convenient.

He'd definitely hate the CCP at the very least.
Damn I had no idea! Thanks for pointing out this hidden fact!
They're all fictional characters but they should not stand for something like this. Orisa stands up for the individual and the underdog. She should not have to be associated with something like this.

Thank you, your decision is not useless, it will help build momentum and presence for the dissatisfaction we all feel, against Blizzard, against corporate greed in general, and against the big scary that is China. As unlikely as it is, I hope it will result in something big. Even the biggest tsunami have to start as a ripple after all. Undeniably, the most effective action is still to just stop purchasing and subscribing to their products, but I understand that it is a difficult choice to make. I disagree with people who would call you a hypocrite for not doing more, but all the same, I would like to leave my warm encouragements.

It's the simpliest way to notify friends. You can do both.
Why not both? Before you stop playing change your name so your friends might stumble upon it in their friends list.
Nah ima play. I need escapism and other games ain't fun for me

As I posted above. I don't want people to feel bad for taking another route.

Like  China? ü§î
Sorry I don't know well enough Diablo lore and character. But yeah. Bring characters from every game they made and make a team for that. Hell we can make a team  of hkfreedom fighter in hots as well.
how are they funding it by playing a game they already paid for? would that technically cost blizzard money to run servers that no one is paying back on?
Well, it helps spread awareness. Some people here certainly care about the issue but simply wont want to stop playing their favorite games or they aren't educated enough to understand why they should. For those people who want to help support the cause but aren't willing to take drastic measures, spreading awareness is an amazing thing to do.  


I'm glad to see we've got intellectuals like you helping out though. /s  üòâ
Thought I recognized your handle; o7 cdr, and I agree.  "Raising awareness" is more often the last step on a path to nowhere, not a first step on a path to real effects.
Cancelling your Battle.net account doesn't really accomplish anything.  Your WoW sub?  Yeah, cancel that.

You've already given Blizzard your money.  Just don't give them any *more*.  You don't have to deprive yourself of products that you have already paid for.  

In fact, a more effective measure would be to use your account *more*.  Tack on bandwidth and storage costs that Blizzard must pay for.
[deleted]
[deleted]
I dont blame you. Parting ways with something that makes you happy because the company has made realpy shitty decisions can be tough and you being happy is still important too. 

That being said, fuck china.
What other games have you tried?
That's actually kind of sad to read, since nothing Blizzard makes nowadays is a paragon of its respective genre. Even Diablo and WoW have been laid low by competitors.
Then you are a part of the damn problem.
Don't even need to play it. Just doing the name change and never logging in again will keep FreeHongKong sitting in people's friends lists until Blizzard goes full CCP.
‚Äúaren‚Äôt willing to take DRASTIC measures‚Äù 

I understand your point, but I can not accept that quitting a video game can be considered a drastic measure for an adult. That is ... just absurd to my ear. People are fucking dying out here.

Don‚Äôt change your name. Quit the game.
Ah, I understand now. You are happy to make a statement of support or damnation regarding some injustice, but not willing to actually do anything about it that will have some tangible effect, or sacrifice anything (especially something as drastic as withholding your time and money from a video game publisher).

/s

You know what raising awareness does if it's not followed by some tangible action? Jackshit, besides making you feel better.

If you don't care, or don't care enough, to be bothered to do something meaningful, that's fine, but then keep your mouth shut.

If you claim to care about something, and you can do something about it that isn't particularly difficult or costly, and you choose not to, then you're a hypocrite and should definitely keep your mouth shut.

"Raising awareness" by changing your name/handle/nick/whatever to something about supporting HK on blizzard games and platforms while playing said games is like decrying a political figure in a whisper while wearing a "Vote for this political figure" hat, t-shirt, pants, socks, shoes, and tighty whities you bought at a vote event for said political figure.

It's not possible you are unable to see the hypocrisy thereof.
o7 Cmdr üòâ
I have never advocated for account cancellation friend. I advocate for denied purchases and denied time on their games.

Denied purchases for obvious reasons.
Denied time because it's the second most important metric to a video game publisher and developer for video games that are online multiplayer in nature, right after revenue generation.
Yeah, I don't play Overwatch so I haven't come across this character, but she looks too damn cute and innocent for my jaded tastes, and the memes are incredibly cringe worthy.

It may not be much at the end of the day, but blizzard ain't getting another cent or any more support out of me.

I've disapproved of the whole HK thing since that extradition legislation was announced, and felt very strongly of the events that followed, but I've never really had an opportunity to make manifest my personal values with regards to the whole tragedy.

But I can do something now. It's small, and it won't have much of an effect, if any, on the situation itself, but it's something I can actually do.

Very few politicians or companies are prepared to truly annoy or challenge China because of their current or future dependency on Chinese money, labour, or products. They essentially have a pass to do whatever the hell they want without much more than lukewarm statements of mild disapproval. It's maddening.

There is a certain politician who has had either the courage, insanity, or idiocy to put forth an actual challenge and resistance to China. He may not be my favourite politician (I have none, they're all self serving dicks parading as champions of the people) but that refusal to bow to Chinese demands and put up some form of a fight (figuratively speaking) is the first real resistance I've seen in a relatively long time.

They get away with a lot of shit that wouldn't be tolerated in the west, and I won't let this blizzard thing slide when there's something I can do.
There's no popularity nor money being funneled via a name change. Change the name. Notify the people on your friend's lists.

Don't play their games. Don't log on anymore. Uninstall. A ghost account with "3 weeks offline" and a "#FreeHongKong" name is a lot more alarming than a deletion of an account to friends.

You didn't read his last bit, "You can do both." You can still not play their game and get the free name change via their website (don't even have to login to their games) and show your solidarity.
I can't stop playing. I know I've tried. But I also know I can stop giving them any more money while I play it.
[deleted]
FFXIV, MTG, tf2 basically all the games that blizzard has made better in my opinion. I just cant stop playing
Idk what you're on but WoW is huge
Wow is the biggest mmo? What? Its like one of the only mmo left
Ok, I dont really care
I only read the first paragraph because I've already begun doing my part via a boycott. I don't play WoW so I don't have a subscription to cancel, I can only speak with my absence & name change as a former Hearthstone player. I've started playing Gods Unchained, the TCG that offered Blitzchung an opportunity to join their tournament and pay him his lost Blizzard winnings regardless of whether he won their tournament or not.

However there are people (who are not me) who care about the political situation but simply wont stop playing the games they enjoy. Whether or not that is morally correct is irrelevant, we both know these people exist. People who are simply upvoting hate threads and doing nothing more because they want people who will actually take action to see it. By spreading awareness via a simple name change they can at least offer something, regardless of how minuscule an impact it may be. If they inform even one additional person about what is happening via the name change (a person that may otherwise be completely unaware) then it's beneficial because perhaps that additional person will actually act on it.

They become the billboards and posters on the sides of public transport if I were to draw a comparison to the advertising business. Sure maybe the people who are posting the signs might not make a difference, but the people who see the advertisements might. & That is better than nothing.
Use the stones to destroy the stones.
So its confirmed it will make me feel better though?
Realistically, cancelling your subscription has as little of an impact as changing your name. It would only matter if a vast number of people do it, and if a vast number of people change their names I think that would also likely have an impact on Blizzard's relationship with China.
How else am I going to reach the Overwatch players who don't read news other than through the game? Plus, it doesn't exactly cost me shit, and the game is still pretty fun to dick around in.
[deleted]
If the money has already been spent on buying the game then me playing or not changes nothing. However if I refuse to spend further money then I am still enjoying my product while no longer giving the company my money. 

I see it as the same thing as when all those people were burning their Nikes when Kaepernick was kneeling during the NFL games during the national anthem. Im not gonna burn my Nikes over it but I wont buy your products again if this is how you view our values.
Lmao put the phone down kid. You arent accomplishing anything at all
My comment was in regards to quality. Large consumer base doesn't mean quality. I don't want to resort to a food analogy, but are you really gonna say that like, McDonald's is huge so that means its burgers are the best in the biz?

Considering how many wow players have been flooding into the communities of XIV, GW2, and ESO, the game's definitely not the titan it once was for myriad reasons. Classic pretty much breathed new life into it, which goes to show that a fifteen year old version of the game with all the rough, jagged, unpolished edges is somehow more desirable than the slopheap they're serving up now. Conveniently tied to a retail subscription, at that.

It's okay to like junk food, but modern Blizzard is far from the developer they used to be, and each game they have out now, someone else does a lot better. If you're not there for the cheap instant gratification style that permeates a lot of their modern titles, at least.
FFXIV? ESO? GW2? Sure they don't have as many players as WOW, and definitely not now that Classic has finally released, but I'll take a game with a smaller playerbase over this current form of Blizzard, willing to quietly submit to the Chinese government to keep the yuan flowing in
I'll give you that it's better than absolutely nothing, without issue. 

My problem is this: for people with the mental capacity to understand the vagaries of the situation (ie not children or mentally impaired people), to elect to do nothing but declare their dissent and then do nothing tangible is disingenuous and hypocritical, because all they need to do is stop paying for and playing a set of video games. They don't need to go to war, or attend a protest, or do anything other than stop playing a specific set of video games.

There has never been an easier way to make a statement of this nature.
Pretty sure it will, and you needn't give anything up for it either! ü§∏
Agreed, a few people cancelling their sub wouldn't have any noticeable impact. Ten thousand cancellations however would send a very strong message. The more cancellations and denied purchases, the stronger the message. 

Can you imagine the message if a million subs were cancelled, alongside denied hearthstone pack purchases, cancelled BlizzCon tickets etc?

Name changes may have an impact on blizzard's relationship with a Chinese consumer base, maybe. That is beyond your control. What is not beyond your control is withholding your money, and that has a very definite and known result. 

I've been playing blizzard games since I was a damn child. I really like my blizzard games. If they had taken a measured response to this whole thing, I'd feel differently. If they had issued a warning and a message about staying apolitical, I'd feel differently. I'm not unreasonable.

They decided to take a heavy handed approach, without temperance and without consideration of circumstance, merit, or reasoning, using rules as an absolute justification for what is patently a severe course of action based on political considerations (which would have financial ramifications). Exactly as a certain single party country, ruled by a man who recently had the constitution changed so he could rule indefinitely, might have done.

I won't stand for that by financially supporting (and now that I'm aware, also implicitly condoning) Blizzard's attitude or stated position. It's a personal decision, and I don't expect anybody else to do the same, but I'd sure as hell like it.
You sound like a jerk. "Protest my way or you are just virtue signaling!"

 What are you doing to make a difference? Hashtags?
Investors are interested in concurrent users and engagement metrics. Good statistics makes them more likely to invest money in Blizzard.
[deleted]
I mean if we go off census and armory numbers from before Classic came along to artificially inflate retail's floundering numbers, XIV was pretty much close to WoW when ShB was a month or so away.

There's a reason they don't disclose sub numbers, and it's not because "OH WE DECIDED SUB COUNT DOESN'T MATTER!"
You're right for the majority of situations, but there is a group of people who have emotional and/or mental dependencies on blizzard games, whether it's WoW, Overwatch, SC, whatever. 

I make no claims about this group of people other than they exist, and that for some, giving up their singular mental escape would be a significant hardship to them. Giving up a particular game, or ANY hobby/activity, is not equally easy for every person. 

For those who have a very difficult time or would suffer some kind of mental hardship by removing the game from their life, I'd argue that a name change might be all they CAN do, and is not *necessarily* disingenuous. 

(I've been reading your other posts in this thread and surrounding threads, and I understand and wholeheartedly agree with where you're coming from. I only disagree with the assumption that quitting a specific video game is just as easy for everyone as it is for the majority.)
Those are not your ordinary hashtags. Those are **bold font hashtags.** That will show them!
Ya this guy doesnt understand you can take 5 mins to change your name in support and then log off and not log back on again, hes acting like changing your name somehow supports blizzard lol
Fair enough. I've known some people who are as you describe, and in most of those cases, of the people I've known personally and in-game, they have bigger personal fish to fry than worry about ideological battles.

The truth is, however, that you're talking about a minority. The majority of players, who I'm certain have their own demons to battle (as we all do), do not have a dependence on blizzard games to keep them going. It's to the majority I speak.

I would just like folk to have the courage of their convictions. If they disagree with what's happened, and are able to (as most are I'm relatively certain), I'd implore them to do something more efficacious than some token action, as it's within their power to do so and would cost them very little. That kind of opportunity doesn't come around very often.
Glad you pointed that out, I thought he was just virtue signaling.
I will repost several times in the same thread so people see my **bold fonts multiple times!**
Yea its a good alternative now that blizzard prevents us from deleting our accounts.

Nice, trying to use a controversy to promote in your own favor. Dunno what gods unchained is but after looking through your comments, damn I‚Äôm never gonna play it. I hope you‚Äôre a bot, and it‚Äôs not an actual persons job to copy and paste that shit constantly
It's the simpliest way to notify friends. You can do both.
Why not both? Before you stop playing change your name so your friends might stumble upon it in their friends list.
Nah ima play. I need escapism and other games ain't fun for me
Lolwut
Join game, #freehongkon, leave game, uninstall game

As I posted above. I don't want people to feel bad for taking another route.
R u telling me. How to protest?

Like  China? ü§î
Sorry I don't know well enough Diablo lore and character. But yeah. Bring characters from every game they made and make a team for that. Hell we can make a team  of hkfreedom fighter in hots as well.
how are they funding it by playing a game they already paid for? would that technically cost blizzard money to run servers that no one is paying back on?
Well, it helps spread awareness. Some people here certainly care about the issue but simply wont want to stop playing their favorite games or they aren't educated enough to understand why they should. For those people who want to help support the cause but aren't willing to take drastic measures, spreading awareness is an amazing thing to do.  


I'm glad to see we've got intellectuals like you helping out though. /s  üòâ
Thought I recognized your handle; o7 cdr, and I agree.  "Raising awareness" is more often the last step on a path to nowhere, not a first step on a path to real effects.
Cancelling your Battle.net account doesn't really accomplish anything.  Your WoW sub?  Yeah, cancel that.

You've already given Blizzard your money.  Just don't give them any *more*.  You don't have to deprive yourself of products that you have already paid for.  

In fact, a more effective measure would be to use your account *more*.  Tack on bandwidth and storage costs that Blizzard must pay for.

I dont blame you. Parting ways with something that makes you happy because the company has made realpy shitty decisions can be tough and you being happy is still important too. 

That being said, fuck china.
What other games have you tried?
That's actually kind of sad to read, since nothing Blizzard makes nowadays is a paragon of its respective genre. Even Diablo and WoW have been laid low by competitors.
Then you are a part of the damn problem.
Don't even need to play it. Just doing the name change and never logging in again will keep FreeHongKong sitting in people's friends lists until Blizzard goes full CCP.
‚Äúaren‚Äôt willing to take DRASTIC measures‚Äù 

I understand your point, but I can not accept that quitting a video game can be considered a drastic measure for an adult. That is ... just absurd to my ear. People are fucking dying out here.

Don‚Äôt change your name. Quit the game.
Ah, I understand now. You are happy to make a statement of support or damnation regarding some injustice, but not willing to actually do anything about it that will have some tangible effect, or sacrifice anything (especially something as drastic as withholding your time and money from a video game publisher).

/s

You know what raising awareness does if it's not followed by some tangible action? Jackshit, besides making you feel better.

If you don't care, or don't care enough, to be bothered to do something meaningful, that's fine, but then keep your mouth shut.

If you claim to care about something, and you can do something about it that isn't particularly difficult or costly, and you choose not to, then you're a hypocrite and should definitely keep your mouth shut.

"Raising awareness" by changing your name/handle/nick/whatever to something about supporting HK on blizzard games and platforms while playing said games is like decrying a political figure in a whisper while wearing a "Vote for this political figure" hat, t-shirt, pants, socks, shoes, and tighty whities you bought at a vote event for said political figure.

It's not possible you are unable to see the hypocrisy thereof.
o7 Cmdr üòâ
I have never advocated for account cancellation friend. I advocate for denied purchases and denied time on their games.

Denied purchases for obvious reasons.
Denied time because it's the second most important metric to a video game publisher and developer for video games that are online multiplayer in nature, right after revenue generation.
Yeah, I don't play Overwatch so I haven't come across this character, but she looks too damn cute and innocent for my jaded tastes, and the memes are incredibly cringe worthy.

It may not be much at the end of the day, but blizzard ain't getting another cent or any more support out of me.

I've disapproved of the whole HK thing since that extradition legislation was announced, and felt very strongly of the events that followed, but I've never really had an opportunity to make manifest my personal values with regards to the whole tragedy.

But I can do something now. It's small, and it won't have much of an effect, if any, on the situation itself, but it's something I can actually do.

Very few politicians or companies are prepared to truly annoy or challenge China because of their current or future dependency on Chinese money, labour, or products. They essentially have a pass to do whatever the hell they want without much more than lukewarm statements of mild disapproval. It's maddening.

There is a certain politician who has had either the courage, insanity, or idiocy to put forth an actual challenge and resistance to China. He may not be my favourite politician (I have none, they're all self serving dicks parading as champions of the people) but that refusal to bow to Chinese demands and put up some form of a fight (figuratively speaking) is the first real resistance I've seen in a relatively long time.

They get away with a lot of shit that wouldn't be tolerated in the west, and I won't let this blizzard thing slide when there's something I can do.
There's no popularity nor money being funneled via a name change. Change the name. Notify the people on your friend's lists.

&#x200B;

Don't play their games. Don't log on anymore. Uninstall. A ghost account with "3 weeks offline" and a "#FreeHongKong" name is a lot more alarming than a deletion of an account to friends.

&#x200B;

I don't mean to antagonize, but I just think it's also a viable option, with the other being complete discontinued support (deleting account).
You didn't read his last bit, "You can do both." You can still not play their game and get the free name change via their website (don't even have to login to their games) and show your solidarity.
I can't stop playing. I know I've tried. But I also know I can stop giving them any more money while I play it.
[deleted]
FFXIV, MTG, tf2 basically all the games that blizzard has made better in my opinion. I just cant stop playing
Idk what you're on but WoW is huge
Wow is the biggest mmo? What? Its like one of the only mmo left
Ok, I dont really care
I only read the first paragraph because I've already begun doing my part via a boycott. I don't play WoW so I don't have a subscription to cancel, I can only speak with my absence & name change as a former Hearthstone player. I've started playing Gods Unchained, the TCG that offered Blitzchung an opportunity to join their tournament and pay him his lost Blizzard winnings regardless of whether he won their tournament or not.

However there are people (who are not me) who care about the political situation but simply wont stop playing the games they enjoy. Whether or not that is morally correct is irrelevant, we both know these people exist. People who are simply upvoting hate threads and doing nothing more because they want people who will actually take action to see it. By spreading awareness via a simple name change they can at least offer something, regardless of how minuscule an impact it may be. If they inform even one additional person about what is happening via the name change (a person that may otherwise be completely unaware) then it's beneficial because perhaps that additional person will actually act on it.

They become the billboards and posters on the sides of public transport if I were to draw a comparison to the advertising business. Sure maybe the people who are posting the signs might not make a difference, but the people who see the advertisements might. & That is better than nothing.
Use the stones to destroy the stones.
So its confirmed it will make me feel better though?
Realistically, cancelling your subscription has as little of an impact as changing your name. It would only matter if a vast number of people do it, and if a vast number of people change their names I think that would also likely have an impact on Blizzard's relationship with China.
How else am I going to reach the Overwatch players who don't read news other than through the game? Plus, it doesn't exactly cost me shit, and the game is still pretty fun to dick around in.
[deleted]
If the money has already been spent on buying the game then me playing or not changes nothing. However if I refuse to spend further money then I am still enjoying my product while no longer giving the company my money. 

I see it as the same thing as when all those people were burning their Nikes when Kaepernick was kneeling during the NFL games during the national anthem. Im not gonna burn my Nikes over it but I wont buy your products again if this is how you view our values.
Lmao put the phone down kid. You arent accomplishing anything at all
My comment was in regards to quality. Large consumer base doesn't mean quality. I don't want to resort to a food analogy, but are you really gonna say that like, McDonald's is huge so that means its burgers are the best in the biz?

Considering how many wow players have been flooding into the communities of XIV, GW2, and ESO, the game's definitely not the titan it once was for myriad reasons. Classic pretty much breathed new life into it, which goes to show that a fifteen year old version of the game with all the rough, jagged, unpolished edges is somehow more desirable than the slopheap they're serving up now. Conveniently tied to a retail subscription, at that.

It's okay to like junk food, but modern Blizzard is far from the developer they used to be, and each game they have out now, someone else does a lot better. If you're not there for the cheap instant gratification style that permeates a lot of their modern titles, at least.
FFXIV? ESO? GW2? Sure they don't have as many players as WOW, and definitely not now that Classic has finally released, but I'll take a game with a smaller playerbase over this current form of Blizzard, willing to quietly submit to the Chinese government to keep the yuan flowing in
I'll give you that it's better than absolutely nothing, without issue. 

My problem is this: for people with the mental capacity to understand the vagaries of the situation (ie not children or mentally impaired people), to elect to do nothing but declare their dissent and then do nothing tangible is disingenuous and hypocritical, because all they need to do is stop paying for and playing a set of video games. They don't need to go to war, or attend a protest, or do anything other than stop playing a specific set of video games.

There has never been an easier way to make a statement of this nature.
Pretty sure it will, and you needn't give anything up for it either! ü§∏
Agreed, a few people cancelling their sub wouldn't have any noticeable impact. Ten thousand cancellations however would send a very strong message. The more cancellations and denied purchases, the stronger the message. 

Can you imagine the message if a million subs were cancelled, alongside denied hearthstone pack purchases, cancelled BlizzCon tickets etc?

Name changes may have an impact on blizzard's relationship with a Chinese consumer base, maybe. That is beyond your control. What is not beyond your control is withholding your money, and that has a very definite and known result. 

I've been playing blizzard games since I was a damn child. I really like my blizzard games. If they had taken a measured response to this whole thing, I'd feel differently. If they had issued a warning and a message about staying apolitical, I'd feel differently. I'm not unreasonable.

They decided to take a heavy handed approach, without temperance and without consideration of circumstance, merit, or reasoning, using rules as an absolute justification for what is patently a severe course of action based on political considerations (which would have financial ramifications). Exactly as a certain single party country, ruled by a man who recently had the constitution changed so he could rule indefinitely, might have done.

I won't stand for that by financially supporting (and now that I'm aware, also implicitly condoning) Blizzard's attitude or stated position. It's a personal decision, and I don't expect anybody else to do the same, but I'd sure as hell like it.
You sound like a jerk. "Protest my way or you are just virtue signaling!"

 What are you doing to make a difference? Hashtags?
Investors are interested in concurrent users and engagement metrics. Good statistics makes them more likely to invest money in Blizzard.
[deleted]
I mean if we go off census and armory numbers from before Classic came along to artificially inflate retail's floundering numbers, XIV was pretty much close to WoW when ShB was a month or so away.

There's a reason they don't disclose sub numbers, and it's not because "OH WE DECIDED SUB COUNT DOESN'T MATTER!"
You're right for the majority of situations, but there is a group of people who have emotional and/or mental dependencies on blizzard games, whether it's WoW, Overwatch, SC, whatever. 

I make no claims about this group of people other than they exist, and that for some, giving up their singular mental escape would be a significant hardship to them. Giving up a particular game, or ANY hobby/activity, is not equally easy for every person. 

For those who have a very difficult time or would suffer some kind of mental hardship by removing the game from their life, I'd argue that a name change might be all they CAN do, and is not *necessarily* disingenuous. 

(I've been reading your other posts in this thread and surrounding threads, and I understand and wholeheartedly agree with where you're coming from. I only disagree with the assumption that quitting a specific video game is just as easy for everyone as it is for the majority.)
Those are not your ordinary hashtags. Those are **bold font hashtags.** That will show them!
Ya this guy doesnt understand you can take 5 mins to change your name in support and then log off and not log back on again, hes acting like changing your name somehow supports blizzard lol
Fair enough. I've known some people who are as you describe, and in most of those cases, of the people I've known personally and in-game, they have bigger personal fish to fry than worry about ideological battles.

The truth is, however, that you're talking about a minority. The majority of players, who I'm certain have their own demons to battle (as we all do), do not have a dependence on blizzard games to keep them going. It's to the majority I speak.

I would just like folk to have the courage of their convictions. If they disagree with what's happened, and are able to (as most are I'm relatively certain), I'd implore them to do something more efficacious than some token action, as it's within their power to do so and would cost them very little. That kind of opportunity doesn't come around very often.
Glad you pointed that out, I thought he was just virtue signaling.
I will repost several times in the same thread so people see my **bold fonts multiple times!**
Yea its a good alternative now that blizzard prevents us from deleting our accounts.
Well said.

I just want someone to ask, ‚ÄòGiven the success of WoW Classic, is there a possibility we may get Blizzard Classic in the future?‚Äô.
Ah, the red shirt clan. Members of this infamous clan are know to always find and point out Blizzard's mistakes at Blizzcon.  Whether it be lore or greedy business decisions.
Don't you guys have representative governments?
You can't silence us! We stand with Hong Kong! Revolution of our time!
Can someone link me the original? I forgot what happened.
Well, not now but 3 weeks from now :D
It's always the guys with the red shirts...
I definitely expect a spicy Q&A question
No way this is red shirt guy. Is he? What?
For he can do it, because he's not a hero.
But he‚Äôs not even the original red shirt guy
RED SHIRT GUY!!
Looking forward to 9/10 questions at the Q&A panels being about HK/China.

Is this an out of season june 4th joke?
He was so wrong, Blizzard is way worse than an april fool's joke, at least a joke is laughable, Blizzard is just disgusting.

Blizzard has a history of guys with red shirts. In 2010 there was the guy who brought up inconsistent lore, in 2018 there was this guy mocking them for the mobile game, and this year there will be plenty of red shirt guys at the door to make sure you don‚Äôt dishonor the sovereignty of China.
Not all Heros wear capes, some only have a red shirt !
The hero we need.  But not the one we deserve...
Need to start a protest in WoW with toons transmog'd with red shirts, and defias masks.

I posted this over an hour ago on r/blizzard and it is still invisible: 'I have been playing Blizzard games and supporting them for the last decade since I began playing Diablo 2 in June 2009 up until the present with Overwatch with some WoW mixed in the middle in between. I can confidently say with no regrets that I can not support them at their current and presumably indefinite horse shit state and I will not be looking back. My PS4 Diablo 3 disc has been discarded and my account has been disabled after a fair deal of unwarranted stress and difficulty and multiple attempts. I hope the Chinese spunk was worth the taste.'

I posted this 30m ago on r/hongkong and it is still invisible: 'I know that it seems obvious at this point, however I and 2 other discord friends tried to submit a post to the board and it has been delayed for 30 or more minutes for each of us while showing that no new posts were created for over an hour. As soon as a post on r/hearthstone mentioned that the submissions seem to be bottlenecked yesterday I have frequently observed 1 to 2 hour time gaps where my posts seem to be submitted to the void and no new ones will appear.'
Yeah I noticed that since I toggled on new posts and all "new" posts are from hours ago
Actually no, Reddit is censoring this subreddit banning accounts from the whole of Reddit.

Yea something wonky is happening with submissions.
how is this revolution of our age?
Blizzard (China) is censoring this sub reddit.
Censoring? As a april fools joke?
"THEY ARE NOT PREPARED!!!"
I absolutely took the piss out of this guy at the time. It seemed like an over the top reaction. "Oh no, a mobile game. Blizzard is still working on a proper Diablo game, they're not selling out to China etc"

I was completely wrong about the situation, and fair play to the lad. He called it well in advance.
Redshirt Dude for world president!
Don't you guys have kidneys?  

Seriously, Comrade Xi is running low, off to the camp you go.

Don't you guys have freedom?
dont  you guys love chinhchong ? /s
 Don't you guys have social credit?
There's season for that?

I'm off to buy some equipment.
You mean getting a company that was once considered one of the best and made excellent games instead of super polished esports platforms where every thing is balanced to death so no matter what you play it's always the same?
*"Ah, yes, 'Democracy'. The form of government allegedly practiced in civilised parts of the world. We have dismissed this claim."*

~~I think immediately after that, we got the infamous "DO YOU GUYS NOT HAVE PHONES?????" line.~~

EDIT: Fixed the timeline of events.
Huh?
If they don't just straight up cancel the QA Panels.
I'm really hoping the angst sticks until then/ the people going can put their fanboi aside to fight for democracy and human rights.
You might be referring to Ian, the first red shirt guy. I am in fact definitely going to Blizzcon this year.
Do you not have a phone? lol
I'm out of the loop on this guy specifically. Who is he?
Or you could stop giving them money.
Hahaha nice!   
For everyone to lazy to translate "is this a stupid april fools joke?"
The 2nd half posted on hongkong refers to the r/blizzard subreddit
There are thousands of posts like yours still up, why would they censor yours? What about all the other anti-China posts that are hitting the front page from other subs? Why would they try to censor anything when the vast majority of stuff will be seen? I don't know your posts are 'invisible' (and I know I'll get downvoted for thus) but I'm not sure we should immediately chalk it up to censorship. In a time like this it's easy to blame everything that goes wrong on China, but sometimes you just have to look at a situation objectively.
What's the source of the picture? I hope there's a video
Approval mode.
That's not true. I just have been banned there. It's worse than this sub :D
I was with him the whole time and glad to be there.
the important thing is you have the ability to change and saw you were wrong, it takes a lot to do that.
or at least as a mod for this sub
That makes it two red shirt guys, I wonder if this one will get an NPC in game as well..
WORLDSTAR
don't you guys have innards?
I grow my own phones
Don‚Äôt you guys stand up for the sovereignty of China?
I disagree with that completely. We can shit on blizzard all day and night for their completely asinine decision making but game balance is not generally in that category.    

Starcraft has massive visual/cost/playstyle distinctions between races. 

Warcraft 1/2/3 was the same way. WoW has gone through a number of iterations on balance but class identity has traditionally been very strong.  

Diablo 3 is a clusterfuck of stupid ideas but the classes do play differently from one another. 

Overwatch is really diverse on playstyle/character selection. 

Hearthstone has an infinite number of decktypes. 

What game were you thinking of specifically when you talked about balance?
Thank you! I remember watching it live but forgot what the guy said.
Not immediately after that. That infamous line comes as a response after the question by LordFluffy if Blizzard plans to bring Diablo Immortal to PC and Wyatt said no.
Am i remembering it wrong or was he promptly kicked off the blizzcon by security right after the camera wasn't looking at him?
You know red shirt guy? If this is the same dude, he definitly never skipped the gym
Or screen the questions and have an employee read them
It's the only reason I would buy a virtual ticket...
You are going to Blizzcon? I thought you weren't?
It was last Blizzcon, Diablo Immortal announcement Q&A: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJy6bJ\_RxXg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJy6bJ_RxXg)
The guy who single handedly brought blizzards stock down by 50%
Yeah thanks... I was going for snarky humor vs. the chinese bullshit... everyone should learn that phrase in mandarin and recite it at Blizzcon... and wear red shirts and masks.
[removed]
Look up out of season April fools joke blizcon on YouTube
>Hearthstone has an infinite number of decktypes.

But people only play like, 5.
D'oh! I had a feeling I wasn't remembering things right...
Nah, I was there all weekend and about 200 people stopped me for selfies and high fives. Even employees were pulling me aside to have conversations. It made an otherwise lackluster blizzcon very entertaining. The best part and I mean BY FAR the best.... it made my wife so uncomfortable HAHAHA.
I don't remember. Wouldn't surprise me if he was, though.

EDIT: Trying to see if his interviews could shed more light on that...

EDIT 2: No idea if he was kicked out, but apparently when he went into the SC II Q&A line the next day to ask an *actual* question, the screener said that they couldn't trust him and pulled him out of the Q&A line.

EDIT 3: Couldn't find any info on if he was escorted out by security, but considering he came back the next day and attempted to ask another question at a Q&A, he probably wasn't.
I was there he did not get kicked out.  He was the hero of Blizzcon.
I am the red shirt Diablo guy. I've been skipping the gym last 2 weeks, they're relocating. I'm getting squishy, sucks.
They'll probably add a question submission form to the Blizzcon app and just read approved questions from that.
Same here. And i'm not savvy enough to know the alternate means of watching it.
I wasn't planning on it earlier in the year because none of my friends were going to go. Suddenly it's ticket purchasing day and ALL of my friends want to go. So we bought tickets and we're going.
Judging by the fact that you called me "commie tard" it's evident that you aren't open to discussion nor willing to consider an alternate point of view. Given this information, there's no point in continuing this argument. Please note that I never supported China I just didn't 100% agree with your view point. But apparently to you this issue is so black and white, which shows that you clearly don't have a good understanding of the matter at all, yet another reason this discussion isn't worth continuing. Maybe try to be a little less extreme in the future?

Edit: Also your removed post has no context attached to it. I cannot see the content and therefore have no reason to believe it is victim to censorship.
as if meta doesn't exist in literally every competitive game
were the employees dissing you?
I know a few good content creators that hit all the high points in reviews, and as always I could just read the summaries somewhere, but that isn't nearly as fun as watching it all going on.

That is the only thing that would get me to buy a ticket, and even that is a hard sell for me with everything that is going on.
Do you plan on getting on the microphone again?
Not really. They were just happy to talk.
No. I don't know what will happen at all.
