What happened to Mei’s eye
[deleted]
This is the best art I've seen so far of Mei supporting Hong Kong protesters. 

Snowball is pretty cute.
Would be better if her clothes were black. Black is the unofficial colour of the protesters. Red usually signifies support for China and the CCP. Most HK protests flags have the same flag but coloured in black and a white flower with no Chinese stars.
Fuck Blizzard
Other ideas:

Bring lorewalker Cho the pandarens to drag wow into this.

Deckard Caine: stay a while and listen...as you sure haven't been doing it for a long time.
So nice!
image saved. HK should have posters all around HK with this pic.  
burn it into walls.
This is some really fucking good art
It just occurred to me that I'd never seen the Hong Kong flag before. I really like it.
The PRC are utterly morally bankrupt and they are going to *fail*. Hong Kong for-fucking-**ever**.
Is there an HD version of this? Might want to print this soon...
Free Hong Kong
I wonder if people will change all blizzcon posters to BlizzKong.

Imagine the faces at blizzcon with everyone chanting blizzkong instead.
A seriously advice though:  
don't use the red flag of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  
Because for the Hong Konger, that symbolize the government who's doing China's bidding.  
Use this one instead:

damn thats nice artwork I am serious
How long before Blizzard remodel Mei? Have to appease their Communist Chinese Overlords!!!
You guys know the voice actress is pro mainland China right?
Don't trust China, China is asshole!
Awwwee
“The world needs more hero”  blizzard hence created one. :)
If you are not already muted in wow classic chat you are doing it wrong..

Personally I think it would be equally hilarious if Mei turned out to be Pro-China - she was created by Blizzard to appease China, after all!

Why settle for the fucking obvious? I challenge somebody to make a Mei picture of:

1: Mei supporting China with a huge suitcase of money in one hand.

2: Mei trying to support Hong Kong and being silenced in some way - like being fired by Blizzard. Or arrested, or tear gassed...
Her boobs look like her stomach. Can’t. Unsee.

We need more of these with proper mandarin or cantonese in the background so as to be disseminated in Hong Kong, if possible, with actual relevancy.
I love the artwork and support the HK protestors, but

Why stop at the bleeding obvious? I challenge somebody to draw:

1: Mei SUPPORTING China with a huge briefcase of money in one hand.

2: Mei being fired for supporting Hong Kong. Or teargassed or arrested or something.
Mei leads the way!

It's in reference to the young protester who was shot in the face with a beanbag round, causing her goggles to shatter and injure her eye. It's since become a symbol of defiance against the HK police's brutal anti-protest tactics.
I think it’s in reference to [this pic that went viral recently](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/541/179/3ea.jpg)
It’s [referencing the injury that a reporter sustained from a police fired rubber bullet](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/amp/world-asia-china-49910636)
It's a reference to the shit the HK police have been pulling; shooting out protesters' eyes. Not just protesters, but also reporters who aren't from Russian Propaganda company RT. RT reporters are treated as royalty. Anyone else gets tear gassed or worse.

Fuck the Hong Kong Police. And fuck mainland China. Glory to Hong Kong!
it was shot out by Chinese polize
To add to this, there are humanitarian laws when using fire arms, live rounds and non lethals like rubber bullets or bean bag rounds. Hong Kong police , which has been replaced by mainland Chinese forcers basically ignore all of these rules of engagements and just beat people with reckless abandon. 

When firing non Lethal rounds you're supposed to aim at the lower body/stomach area, NOT the head for precisely reasons described above. It's been shown time and time again they don't care.

There's no way to make something completely removed from the cultural context that you live in.
Games are always political mate
The last non political video game was Pong.
>we should not be politicizing games

Why not?
Games are political. Everything is political. And China is using Hollywood and the game industry to spread it's politics.
Listen, mate, games are Art. All art is political, because humans express themselves via art, and there isn't an ounce of human expression that isn't political in some way.

Never mind that we're currently in a time where some people *existing* is considered a political statement. So much as including some people in any shape way or form is considered a political statement.

So I don't wanna fucking hear it, tbh.
Could be straight from inside the overwatch team
Blizzard also is, doesn't mean we won't turn her into a hong kong symbol.
Makes this even better. I bet it'd piss her off *royally* to see *her* character associated with pro-HK messages.
I know the casters lost their jobs for being pro-hong Kong.
It's easier than trying to get them to close your account tho.
Mei’s VA is pro-China if that counts

Pressuring an American company, not a foreign country. Voting with our wallets and spreading imagery that could threaten the company's future in a big market.  Also a cool picture.
Ah well - if can find the source you should edit and credit =)
She permanently lost her sight in her right eye.
As much as I love this meime, Mei has no right to criticize others for shooting sharp objects into the heads of defenseless people.
Not just a protester, she's a First Aider.

That's so messed up, yet so funny.
That also happened but it actually is a reference to the young girl who was shot in the eye with a bean bag round from close distance, while she wasn’t even near the protest flash point. 

The reporter is a separate case that happened months later. Yeah, the HKPF like to headshot...
Before point out hk police, please think what you have do first?

Calling for a strike but no one in HK follow so decide to destroy the public transporation system to pretent we are supporting the strike?

Destroy and burn all Starbucks cafe because maxim's  founder's daughter said she don't support you and she love China?

is this madness? is this justice? you call for freedom. but you dont allow we the hK people to have freedom?

Do you guys not have freedom?  shame on you.

I believe the artist asked someone to post it for them anonymously.

It was in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dffh96/someone_drew_this_hong_kong_mei_and_asked_me_to/) r/HongKong thread, not sure if it's the origin.
Multiple people are shot in the eye, one of the reason why some people start to get more violent was a man shot in the eye waaaaaay back in June when the protest was peaceful. When you get punch, and get punch some more, people tends to, you know, punch back.
I don't think Mei has ever shot anyone "defenseless"
Yeah! Our great Chinese police are the REAL victims in this conflict! Praise be the Chinese military! All hail our leader who definitely doesn’t resemble a certain yellow cartoon character!
shit like that is why your wife left you.
I try not to feed trolls but I just gotta say man your post history makes me legit sad. Maybe you should take your own advice?
Why not both? Or even, how can I "worry" about myself without also "worrying" about the world I am in?

> If I am not for myself, who will be for me? But if I am only for myself, who am I? If not now, when?
Oh word! Just googled hk eye injury and that was the first hit.
There are 1.7 million members - MEMBERS - in the protest against China.
That is not talking about the people who donate to the protest, people who are following the protest, or people who support the protest. 1.7 million members. And the police are order to fire bean bags, from there guns, through masked protesters. When the bag hits the mask, the mask shatters and the glass goes in the eyes of the victims, and so too does the bean bag.

You should know that you can’t use non-lethal weapons above the chest because of stuff like this. You have to target the chest or the stomach.
HK belongs to all of China. Your state doesn't just get to leave the USA because it doesnt like law.
No, governments come and go with the wind. I'm talking "China" here, a name that's endured for millennia. You still call the land China right? The same China that's held Hong Kong for said millennia. The United States is on it's second government, France is on it's fifth. The government is not the civilization.

>Because some people use games as an escape 

Cool. But video games are an art form. Politics is inescapable in creative mediums.


>and some ignorant people don’t understand that threatening an AMERICAN company does not resolve the Chinese issues

That's... not what's happening.

They want the American company to stop supporting Chinese authoritarianism. Obviously that wont magically stop the problem in China. The issue is these people don't feel comfortable supporting a company that doesn't support human rights. This is just the free market at work, lol

That's actually not accurate. Sadly, I just downvoted your comment.

## FAQ
 
### What does this mean?
 
The amount of karma (points) on your comment—and Reddit account—has decreased by one.
 
### Why did you do this?
 
There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be unworthy of positive or neutral karma. These include, but are not limited to:
 
* Rudeness towards other Redditors,
* Spreading incorrect information,
* Espousing regressive ideologies:
 * Religion or the existence of gods, astrology, numerology, ghost belief, and other super-natural excesses
 * Bigotry, including racism, sexism, homophobia, anti-immigration, Islamophobia, and gender binary
 * Right-wing "Chud" policies such as Voter IDs, privilege denial, pro-murder-toys, "freeze peaches", flat tax rate, anti-choice misogyny, and supporting the violent insurgency in Hong Kong
* Too much focus on children's entertainment, such as Fortnite or Cartoon Network,
* An otherwise incorrect or non-valid opinion,
* Spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors or missteps,
* Sarcasm not correctly flagged with a `/s`.
 
### Am I banned from the Reddit?
 
No—*not yet*. But you should refrain from making comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to issue an additional downvote, which may put your commenting and posting privileges in jeopardy.
 
### I don't believe my comment deserved a downvote. Can you un-downvote it?
 
Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a downvote. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot me a private message explaining what I got wrong. I tend to respond to Reddit PMs within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of downvote appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.
 
### How can I prevent this from happening in the future?
 
Accept the downvote and move on. But learn from this mistake: your behavior will not be tolerated on Reddit.com. I will continue to issue downvotes until you improve your conduct. Remember: Reddit is privilege, not a right.
smart move
This?

No it is not true. they claim there are 1.7 million people did the protest. But this number is puffed. HK's street is very narrow. there is no chance to put 1.7 M in the protesting area.

Let me tell you, these protesters claimed they had a very successful protest in Shatin, which is right under my apartment, and 200K people joined the activity. what i saw, is they had less people than the Stand charted marathon  start up place. which is around 20k to 30k people. i am the volunteer of th marathon so i am quite clear about the No. of people.  so the so called 1.7M people I guess should be around 170K. to 340K.

another rumor these people liked to share is police officers killed them.  so far they could not show any solid ground to support them.

more interesting thing is, they also claim the local policemen raped them. which i dont know how these people can believe in such ridiculous rumors.

HK need to fight for freedom. but not in this way. currently these protesters are not fighting the goverment, not attacking the communism party, but crackdown train stations, burn restaurants, cafes and banks in residence area. will the evil Xi jingping in these places? is Carrie Lam lived in these places? go attack them. not us!
Finally, someone willing to defend Chinese pride! Thank you for expressing the truth on Hong Kong’s inviolable Chinese identity.


We have deposited 50 social credit points to your account, and you have earned the privilege to receive organ donations from our generous Hong Kong residents and Falun Gong practitioners.
If you’re talking about the United States, actually yeah they can. They’d just need to get voters on board with it all.
Minecraft is a game that is spreading the views of needing to go back to our roots and become hunter-gatherers again. Undoubtably a game that defies the modern society we live in today; very political
You're obviously a state-sponsored account. Your entire profile looks fake.
Wait, maybe I’m mis-reading your post, but are you saying “supporting the violent insurgency in Hong Kong” is a reason you’re downvoting? Please clarify, because it’s important to be clear on this issue in this thread in particular
Considering blizzard employees did a walk-out in support of HK, this could be coming from *inside the house!*
yeah
I agree, other than 50 cents nothing is true
Wait, can anyone get social points? Can someone who doesn’t live in China get social points?
If so, that is neat.

Also, yes. A USA state can leave the USA. The USA supports freedom above all else.

Freedom of Speech

Freedom of Religion

Freedom of Opinion

Freedom of Choice

Freedom of Liberty

I may have forgotten some of them, Which isn’t my intentions. BUT, I know for a fact that if I were to show public support for a protest group, I wouldn’t get my life ruined.

Also, did the The British colonized Hong Kong during there massive expansion?
And didn’t the United Kingdom owned Hong Kong, up until 1997?

If so, and I know I’m right, Hong Kong wasn’t always part of China.
Also Hong Kong hasn’t showed support for the Chinese Government.
I, for one, would imagine Hong Kong would slowly support the Chinese Government, but over the years, Hong Kong trust and support for the Chinese Government has decreased and decreased and decreased. And it hasn’t gotten any better.
Or another civil war! Take back the mainland! Hawaii for the win!

that is how you guys doing in hong kong. if we dont support ur guys. then call us china's dog, slave of xijingping. who gave you the rights to accuse other people? who gave you the right to stereotype us? you are doing the same thing as the Chinese. I am sponsored?  shall i show you my blizzard game account with every game I have purchased?  once we told the world you guys are evil then you dont allow us to speak. THATS ENOUGH.
No, no. I'm just copypasta the same thing that this guy has been copypastaing all over the place. I'm pro HK.

Well to be honest, my kind was Native Americans of the plains, so yeah

I just really like Hawaii.

Rick music in itself is breaking away from society, going against the grain. By making a game on it, the creators are trying to show the big picture, that we should stop taking everything for face value and rebel. Mildly political
