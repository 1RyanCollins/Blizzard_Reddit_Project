A seriously advice though:  
don't use the red flag of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.  
Because for the Hong Konger, that symbolize the government who's doing China's bidding.  
Use this one instead:

Remove the stars!
fight for freedom!
so wtf is going on with hong kong and blizzard? i dont watch the news
Very few HK use reddit so they will not notice this. We should post it on LIIH or the reddit equivalent of Hong Kong and on Facebook
We don't need this support but still thank you. 

Protesters could not represent HK but now they dont allow us to speak out.

If you want to support HK, please support the real Hong Kong people.
Alright, next characters. Atleast one or two from wow. Maybe jaina and thrall?.
Perhaps Jim raynor and kerrigan from starcraft and one archangel from Diablo. 
Maybe?  New skins lets go.
So post it again, until the chinese censors take note of it
That's right
Breathe it out
Didn't know that.  This just makes it even worse.
Do you have a source that's not youtube?
Great idea!
Wow. A real chinese bot.
Bad bot
Do tell, who are the real Hong Kong people?
We get it, you do not want your organs harvested. Stay safe comrade.
Yeah normally I get annoyed by reposts but for once I would be happy if every single post on the front page was this image for a long, long time.
He has his sources in the description
If you call all different opinions are bots. then you have 360 degree difference comparing to China Government.  i thought people can understand the basic but i am wrong just waste time. You protesting guys just doing too over in recent weeks. we are ENOUGH. we want to speak out instead you speak by using our names.
360 degrees would put you back at the beginning.
Would you dare to post in your weibo account 8964 to prove your authenticity my self proclaimed Good Samaritan  Hong Konger?
Start your own instead trying to hijack this one!!!
glad to see you fully understand what i have expressed. and made my day.
What you were looking for is a 180° turn

360 would put you at thinking the exact same thing as b4. Meaning nothing changed

But really is just hard to understand anything you said, not trying to be rude it's just really rough.
It's broken English but the meaning is there. They are saying that by calling them a bot just for posting their opinion, there is no difference to what the chinese government are doing (360 difference == exactly the same).
Right... there’s gotta be another term for GCP supporter... hm...
