Have we been censored? [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dfzlm8/this_is_odd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)
Seriously guys Zarya is a bit op and

To be honest I prefer Winston, but

Overwatch is a game of strategy, so

People usually need to change.

+

Personally I feel I’m a dps, but 

Lately my heals have been on point.

Ana is my favorite healer, 

You just have to be able to hit shots.

I’m thinking of trying mercy again,

Never played her after the reworks.

Gonna try later maybe!

+

Before I end this comment I’d 

Like to say one more thing about the 

Incredibly overwhelming power of

Zarya. The shields alone make 

Zarya a formidable tank, standing 

Against enemies that would down 

Reinhardt in an instant.

Definitely need to reword her devs.

+

Guess I’ve made this comment

A little too long.

Maybe I should try to revise it

Even though it holds valuable info.

Should be okay I guess.

(Made this to post on blizzard game subreddits that delete comments!!)
I’m glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family’s organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
I'm honestly *amazed* Mei / Overwatch hasn't been banned in China yet.
Didn't her voice actor come out in support of China today?
Nothing to say blizzard? Maybe you should get those tiny chinese dicks out of your mouth

Democracy: The HKers now have more democracy than the colonial era, where governors during the era were appointed by the British government, and I believe all the governors were British. Now they can pick from candidates selected by China.  


Freedom: Look at the link I have linked above.
I stand with Mei! I stand with Hong Kong! I stand against Blizzard! We all do! Liberate Hong Kong! You cannot silence us!
Democracy is always worth fighting for whether Hong Kong or not
OOOOH RAHH
HK Mei doesn't have both eyes.
And she was never heard from again.
Easy karma? Easy karma
Sorry, no way I can bring myself to support this

Blizzard doesn't though
Quick, does anyone know if imgur have Chinese ties?
The person who posted that deleted it himself/herself. Reddit didn't remove it. I'll link the original post in a second https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dg2hat/this_picture_showing_the_chinese_flag_with_the/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

It's one of top posts
No one cares. That's not what this post was about lol
Bro shut up lol this is important lol
ROFL.  Spot on, well done!
i wouldn't be surprised if activision is saying "this isn't official, it's just HK terrorist doing this".
I hadn't seen that so im not sure.
Sure she can! It artistic liberty lol
please don’t harvest my organs xi
Finally some smart people in here!
We're trying to get Blizzards games banned in China. Starting with overwatch
Thats the point!
[this link shows that a mod removed it. ](https://snew.notabug.io/r/Blizzard/comments/df6fn9/blizzard_unveils_new_logo/?utm_content=t1_f39uakb&utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf). If you look at the top it’ll say it in the pink part
The devil is in the details.
/r/woosh
^^psssssst ^^^it’s ^^^an ^^^acrostic ^^^poem
Read the letters...
I’m sorry I’m confused, I never said any of this wasn’t important
To be fair, that is correct. Blizzard and the voice actress behind the character are both opposed to this. And Mei as a character is from a completely different part of the country, farther from Hong Kong than Miami is from New York.

It's a minor form of it sure, but it's not really any different from Isis taking a vaguely middle-eastern character and using it for propaganda.
[Oof](http://imgur.com/a/8P039Ws)
Give me a sec. I'll look it up.
I expect this comment to be downvoted to oblivion just like what happened to all my comments with any of these links followed by the usual accusation of being some paid Chinese internet censor(I'm not fromChina BTW I'm from Singapore)

I'm beginning to think the only reason why anyone is still supporting the riots is because no one knows about the riots. Only news censoring police actions out of context to make them look bad seem to be getting through

This riots made me loss all confidence in western media, they are no better than Chinese propaganda
Oh hell fuckin yes.
Hmmm interesting. I'm not familiar with the website you linked but if it's right, it's even more fucked up that the mods would delete it and then make a reply saying the person did it themselves. Like at least have some self respect and let it be ambiguous.
I don’t think they understood my intention with the post
I didn’t wanna be THAT person to point shit out, thank you stranger lol
"She is a game character.  She stands for science and climate change in the game from what i understand. What she stands for in the game has nothing to do with the movement. the residents of China and Hong Kong that play overwatch like Mei as she is a chinese character."

"Well Mei is really a popular representation of the chinese people and is simply being used as a way to backfire on blizzard anyways.  The beliefs of the woman that voices her character in the game is irrelevant to this situation.  Though i believe something should be said that the voice actress has not received any backlash from Blizzard (that i know of) from her support of China."

Sorry im not reddit savvy and i was also too lazy to retype it all lol but i believe this could help explain the use of Mei a bit better.  She is a symbol for Hong Kong and whatever her game background is irrelevant.  Her voice actors opinion should have no bearing on the situation either.
Gotcha.  Well Mei is really a popar representation of the chinese people and is simply being used as a way to backfire on blizzard anyways.  The beliefs of the woman that voices her character in the game is irrelevant to this situation.  Though i believe something should be said that the voice actress has not received any backlash from Blizzard (that i know of) from her support of China.
yuck
I agree except for one point: China is REALLY bad at propaganda. I think they either don't care about winning the international propaganda war or they think it's a waste of money.
That’s why people are even more upset. Just letting things be would have been a better move
Yeah lol it was too clever! Read downwards!
I dont think the VA will unless she uses the blizzard network (stream or official social media accounts), so long as she does it on her stuff, she'll be safe.
That makes sense, it just seemed weird to me because I thought there was some canon about Mei being a protester. Didn't realize it was just using Blizzard's own character against them.


**Edit:** I'm fully in support of HK. I just misunderstood this one.
It's really weird y'all wanna use her likeness to say something completely opposite of what she believes in.
I think they know the western media hegemony is too effective where they already reach, so yeah probably they think it's a waste of money.
I’ve had way too many comments taken down lol had to get around them somehow
All good.  Theres a lot of misinformation out there!
She is a game character.  She stands for science and climate change in the game from what i understand. What she stands for in the game has nothing to do with the movement. the residents of China and Hong Kong that play overwatch like Mei though as she is a chinese character.
The voice actor has no morals. The character she plays does
You gotta be pretty creative to get to level 70 as a Magikarp!
Lol was just banned from the overwatch subreddit, can’t be THAT creative.
My splash has evolved but I have not.
