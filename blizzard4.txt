"There are dozens of us"
According to PCgamer

It's a bit ominous. 

The protesters have given out a lot of shirts and stickers so far, but most people are walking around them to get to security. There are police in the area, but like the convention employees they are completely ignoring the protesters.

Can someone get me a free shirt?
Im proud of all the people who protested at blizzcon
Good, don't let that half-assed apology stand.
Any1 saying this controversy has had no effect is silly. I know a number of people who dropped wowclassic and canceled their subs. Myself included. They have definitely been affected
Quick reminder Meis voice actor was bullied and harassed for daring to post that she loves her country of China.
Well, it has begun.
Yeah but like ... some of the people i talked to thought about going back because of the stuff they announced.   
It's like they did it on purpose (banning him )so that we'll quickly forget about it again because of Blizzcon
...and the CCP bot farm descends.
There's literally one user (right now) down voting all of the comments that side with the protestors.

I will restore your points. His power means nothing.
Wow like 6 people protesting
Thanks for supporting hong kong
Yeah, Blizzard basically asked for this.
I don't get it. Where's the snow?
holy shit dude thats awesome there are still protesters there thats amazing
10-20 People demonstrating is "today at blizzcon". I have guild friends there and they did not even notice them...
Oh wow the president actually apologized, I'm surprised
The apology made during the opening did not address the facts and did not state what Blizzard wants to do next time something similar happens.

D4 trailer was cool, but there is still a bad taste in the mouth.
HongKonger here. Thanks for your support to the HK protest!
Meh, the show was a success and the hype they brought today already got more than half the kids off this bandwagon.
I want one of these shirts
The "free HK" protest has had no effect on blizzard community what so ever. The large community are still playing their games and could care less. Simple search on you tube and their main channel just proves the large majority of people just don't care. Im seeing a lot of content creators making more videos about blizzard and their stand on this shit show but 100k online protesters vs 11.5M people who are still playing, its not gonna work. They need to find another route or its just gonna die.
I played Overwatch from day 1 and I have deleted my account. Its not much, but they won't get my play hours and I will never spend another dollar on anything they have a hand in.
Yep, that was about as expected.
Blizzard did apologize. [link to full apology](https://youtu.be/CscJ58tRcEo)

Personally, I will wait and see what they actually DO to follow that up.  I'll definitely get on Overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 if they make true amends, otherwise my wallet remains shut and my account remains logged out.
It begins.
Ok cool but overwatch 2 and Diablo 4 boyeeee!!!
I still love blizzard! Can't wait for shadowlands!
this wasnt about china.

it was about censoring people.

i hope the people of hong kong win their freedom also. i think trump should stop being a little bitch and go crazy cowboy, and help hong kong also.

sometimes you need a crazy cowboy in the driver seat.

point is, dont try to censor people in america, unless you want a fight.
Good, all I’ve been hearing out of blizzcon is people excited for their new games. No!!! They announced these to get us of their back. Don’t give in.
Aw man I want a shirt
This does put a smile on my face
Damn.... I want one of those shirts so bad.
I kind of wish I could get one of those shirts.
Thank you
Where are these t-shirts made though.
That truck is an oxymoron
This Blizzcon was probably the best thing to happen o Blizzard. So many huge announcements people kind of seem to be like “Hong Kong who?”
That does put a smile on my face
Doesn't the slogan "Mei with Hong Kong" sound a bit casually racist?
atlest 10 people have to dress up as chinese/hongkong riot police so it can be a real protest.
If I’m going to blizzcon why would I waste time and energy on protestors ? I support Hong Kong but I’m there to enjoy the new games and atmosphere.

I already called it that gamers and the internet have a memory of a goldfish. Blizzard stocks are up and blizzard, Hong Kong etc arnt top subreddits for a while now. It’s not black and white like so many of these guys think it is.
DIABLO 4
So like 6 nerds standing outside doing jack shit? About the extent of slactivism I’d expect from redditors.
Should they also protest for all the whistle blowers in the US recently that have been detained and prosecuted?
Anyone who paid to go to Blizzcon probably does not care what happens in China.
Lmao
I would love a shirt. Is there a way to get one shipped?
all news reports say it  was over 30 protestors 

so basically no one

you can now shut up about hong kong and blizzard because you clearly don't care
Here we go
I like Blizzard so much more now
Wasting time with that shit, d4 hype
Yeah luckily it was all way outside beyond security.
Can someone send me a free T-Shirt in UK?
Oh I want one!
Good
good.
Lol they're killing Mei in this video 100% FREE HK punishment
Would be cool if people brought the protest to the front of a blizzard HQ and not a convention where people are just trying to enjoy a game they like.
Sure showed them.
Lmao sure China cares about the opinions of a bunch of pasty white losers
Lol y'all are dumb.

You already know you'll be buying the new D4 game and playing that. You're all hypocrites.

And Blizzard won't change.
Today at Blizzcon what, there were maybe 20 people at any given time who were making fools out of themselves. What Blizzard did wasn't wrong, they were just idiots about how they did it because you jackassess like a good drama shitstorm. Considering absolutely nothing appears about Hong Kong on r/popular anymore and considering that pretty much every post on this sub is about Blizzard justifiably banning a guy who decided to make a controversial political statement on an event that was about gaming, I'll say you morons will milk this cow for a long time after it dies.
It's such a shame that all of the games they've been working so hard on have had their development timeline pushed back two years.
What do people on the other side yell? 

China is one? 

HK is china? 

hand over HK?
van with the word freedom democracy written on the side, hmmm
I want a free Hong Kong shirt now.
*Today is gonna be ok
Protesting an abusive and repressive state, while standing in and participating in another abusive and repressive state.... so dope.
So not shit
Blizzard must have felt SO awkward a few weeks ago when people started using Mei as a protest figure, when she's a pretty significant part of the new short.
/r/wow and /r/overwatch unfortunately dont seem to care. And if they announce D4, I doubt others would too ):
So in other words, a drop of water in the ocean as the fish swim where they want to go.
can someone get me a shirt pls :(
Thank you very much!!!!!!!
If anyone is there, or if you are one of the protestors, I'd love to get a shirt.  Get in touch.
Until they announced Diablo now all of a sudden everyone forgot.
We need to send liberty prime to Hong Kong. Let's see Chinese paid police officers hit him with tear gas.
How do I get myself a free free hk shirt?
Change team
So glad to see this happened.
They should be protesting the crappy game reveals too!
Hopefully the handout is going well. Is it ?
Can i get a free t shit ?
Brexit lol
So it's going EXACTLY the way everyone expected.
Free HK bros
Odds of Mei getting banned??? 😐
Woah, a petition? Sign Me(i) up
I new there had to be some who would spoil it  take your protests some where els
But they released OW2, a Co-Op game which seems really fun! Anyways, they still deserve that for supporting China.
Lol sad
I want a free T-shirt!
Golly that seems well-funded.
As long as they aren't messing with anyone or ruing their fun, i'm cool with this...
This post help the CCP becous it genrated money for Reddit wich then goes to China.
Ahh good
I need a shirt,sadly I’m in germany
What ever happened to boycotting this event?
Wow, there are like a dozen of them.  

Looks like the boycott is going well too with Diablo, Overwatch and WoW now trending.

It's a wonderful sentiment but has sadly accomplished nothing.
And they accomplished almost nothing, as per the sjw usual preformance
I want a t shirt
These are amazing! To stand with hk is important in the sense that the spreading ccp influence on the free world would harm your personal benefits too! Some of the senators who have close relationship with ccp are already abandoning the interest of the U.S. citizens for their own good. Hk is a perfect example of how sad it could be if you do business with ccp who has no integrity at all! So boycott blizzard and other companies which kneel down when they can actually defend!
not sure you know what a nihilist is if you think you can label someone that based on whether or not they play video games
Granted blizzard handled this poorly but I think people dont give enough consideration to certain points.

Firstly, all competitive esports players in a blizzard tournament will have signed a contract. That contract has clauses in it prohibiting players from making political comments or statements. If you break your contract then you risk facing the consequences of that contract.

Secondly, I cant think of a single way blizzard could have handled this that would have been considered amicable. Theres a level of hiprocrasy from people who are now deciding to stop buying blizzard products. The realities of the Chinese government have been known for years, recent blizzard games have been produced using the money earnt from chinese sales. 

Where was your protest 2 or 3 years ago, or when China started rounding up Muslims. Why did you continue to support blizzard then, and by contrast; why is it that  a relatively unknown hearthstone player eating the consequences of breaking his contract  became the thing that pushed you into action.

If you want to stop buying blizzard products that's fine but dont kid yourself that it makes any difference. China makes all the computer chips in your TVs, computers and consoles. You wont go an entire day without using or handling something made in China. We support the chinese government every day. 

This protest is dumb, I was really disgusted with blizzard when this initially came out. Watching it all unfold however, the protesters make me sympathise with blizzard so much more.
[removed]
This wasn't a protest this was an "Awareness Rally" which Is still admirable.
Kinda depressing, everyone is talking about the d4 announcement around me and every single time I have mentioned how I doubt blizz can actually do it, the conversation becomes about Blizz.. and it turns out nobody had ANY idea about what happened. Never heard of it. I even got someone who had no idea what was happening in HK.
All from 23 to 35 years old btw..
what an a mei zing protest.

&#x200B;

so much mei in the ow2 trailer too
this post is more popular than the china blizzard flag one and i love it
Diablo 4 and suddenly everyone forgives and forgets. You watch.

We shall see.
This is probably about as big as the Area 51 raid. Congrats to all 20 people involved...
Today at blizzcon idiots gather outside to be annoying in a vain attempt of moral inflation as they think they're helping when in fact they are as helpful as sandpaper in a desert
I'm curious what they think they are going to accomplish here... I think absolutely nothing.  It seems like another example of LARPing as pretend revolutionaries and then they go back home and play WoW Classic in their bedroom.
[removed]
lol like 50 protesters showed up hahahahaa
Until Blizzard apologizes and stops being China's lapdog let's stop buying their games.

And we shouldn't accept any "both sides are good" apologies either. China is corrupt, ignoring Hong Kong's right to self government, and American companies have no morals if they ally with a totalitarian state like China.
I'm here now for a totally different reason can't participate. But it's feels like for every person in the handful of protesters, there's about a few hundred folks super psyched about BlizzCon. I'm not saying that the protest shouldn't happen. Kinda hoped it would be bigger.
What worthless hypocrites.  Protesting for freedom & democracy for HK, while protesting free speech & capitalism at home & they're shocked, SHOCKED when they see HKers posting Trump memes as a sign of freedom.
> Today **outside** Blizzcon

FTFY

Seriously, if the HK protesters had the brains of this lot they'd have tried to protest in the suburbs.
Crowd, disperse! They announced overwatch 2 and diablo 4. So uhhhhhhhhhhh how do I get my Blizzard account back?
guys how do I reactivate my blizzard account? my anti blizzard memes aren't getting upvotes and gold anymore.
You people really like to pretend that Blizzard is the cause of the HK protests,they acted based on their rules.A company like that has absolutely no reason to side with anyone or advicate for any social/political issue.Their purpose is to create entertainment.I would just like a world in wich all companies would stop pretending like they care.And i would argue that they have done more to bring people together than you give them credit for.People like Redditors like to force their hand but no good can come out of this.So you must do whatever you feel like is best for you and stop with the make yourself feel good comments.
And so it begins
Did blizzard America do this or was it blizzard China’s decision?
Ahaha yeeeeesss. This is going to be hilarious!
Cant wait for The Internet Historian to cover this
I legitimately thought they were going to kill Mei in the Overwatch 2 trailer.
Glad you guys pulled together
man, i really want that shirt. :/
All of 10 people that care? It is sad but not surprising in the least
What's this gonna do?
wow very brave
Virtue signaling
I'm glad this is still going on!
Mei's voice actor does NOT stand with those rioters. 
and the flag is the HK Chinese flag after handover by the white colonialists.
We are dozens! Dozens!
Liberate hong kong
Doesn't matter, everyone deleted their Blizzard accounts already, right?
Consumers.
Can you all stop with this propaganda bullshit. The extradition bill is gone, and the murderer walked away free. You "won"
BlizzCon has been awesome so far, where my D4 boys at?
Blizzard shaking rn
that diablo 4 trailer is making it hard for me to not be a complete piece of shit
Here is a support from Hong Kong . Even Hong Kong is likely going to be destroyed by Chinese CCP,  I hope America and the world are still free and resist Chinese company. In fact, Chinese gov itself cannot silence the world. It matters when all the people in the world stand up and resist. Those company cannot only make money from China because the Chinese market itself is relatively small compared to the World

Thank you!
What a turnout! Guess this is what they mean about that whole “vocal minority” thing... When in an echo chamber do as the echo chamber does!
Fight for Freedom, Stand With Hong Kong.
Why you guys so stupid
Good. Im glad none of the announcements about new games are distracting people
Overwatch 2 and diablo 4 ain’t saving blizzard this time
I can see China absolutely shitting themselves a bunch of radicalized teens are being manipulated into protesting at a games company event.
This is a general reply to those people on this thread that are mocking people who object or protest Blizzard and their actions.

A thing people, like you, don't realize is that a lot of people that are against Blizzard's actions don't even live in the US or even had bought tickets. Do you honestly believe that all these people have time and money to fly to the US to protest outside a glorified advertisement? People have families, jobs, commitments. The only thing these people could possibly do is to stop giving Blizzard more money and delete their accounts. And then people like you shit on them for not standing by their convictions and 'showing' Blizzard. Those that attend these things obviously don't care about anything other than the games Blizzard makes/sells. People that object to CCP and Blizzard has already done what they can to distance themselves from them.
Protestors amass!!  Oh shit theres only like 5 of us.  Boy do we look dumb..
I was so angry while I watched the trailer on twitch, they even highlighted Mei in the trailer they give zero fucks. And the thousands of people in the hall listening to Kaplan made me sick. It was just a meme for most people,scum.
And we come to find out that after all that has happened over the past month, ultimately people do not care about Blizzard supporting China as long as they get the games they want.
I mean, I know they're protesting, I just keep not getting why are they using the colour of the government to be in favor of Hong Kong. "Freedom Democracy" with the colour of the dictatorship flag. I know it's a minor thing, but that's just so silly that they needed to pay just a little more attention to do that. Is not the best thing to use the colour of symbol of your enemy to protest against them. Yes, they tried to make Mei a symbol to make it illegal in China... Which didn't work and ended up just serving as marketing as everyone kept an eye to Blizzard and Blizzcon, making the announcements today have even more viewers and making more propaganda for them. 

After they reduced the penalties from the HS player (I forgot the name), the fuel of using Mei and other OW characters was just free marketing for blizzard. They just needed to stay silent and things would just settle down and in the end everything will be just the same as usual with maybe more people watching them and seeing they're launching new games.
Hk needs mainland China more than the other way
I am so so appreciate as a HKer. Thank you.

I love you, american.
Solidarity with Hong Kong!!!!!!!
Throw them all in jail.
It's always the few who make the most noise. Good to see people avoiding this Hong Kong crap and focusing more on the event.
[deleted]
I wonder how many people are there that don’t even know what blizzard is. But just wanna be part of the fad.
Pretty funny how only the first few rows are cheering.
Don't forget, *none of this is endorsed by Blizzard.*

In fact, Blizzard's stance is the exact *opposite* of this: they oppose democracy.
D4!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! =D
Weak ahaha
Oh yeah. Today he was a joke
im hoping this post wont get removed at all itll suck if it does
[deleted]
China's not going to like this. Better get on stage blizzard and issue an apology.
The vain ritual of protesting in the US. Every one returns home to their beds none the worse and having only given up a small fraction of their free time accomplishing nothing and breathing hot air. Meanwhile the very issue they want to "help" with sees no benefit from this empty notion because their thousands of miles away, but hey people on twitter took the time to post a sentence "in solidarity" and t-shirts were made. Boy, if that isn't insulting to those people who suffer at the hands of real tyranny in this world.
Ah yes, the hong Kong protests
Because waving American flags and believing that the US is free means rebellion
I'm sorry I understand this is for a good cause or whatever. But come on, this is a video game convention, not a politicon.
As a HongKonger really appreciate that .It mean a lot to know the world is standing with us
You showed them!
Such brave democracy fighters, we should be giving them trophies for their fight for freedom against evil Chinese oppression.
It's nice to see! Thank you all for not letting this blow over!
Blizzard asked for this and now they will get it. All 15 of those protesters should zerg rush the building. There will be at least 3 left by the end but just enough to raise awareness about King Kong
For those not seeing why this is good. This is the character from Blizzards game. Aka blizzard whom is making sure there image is pro China. Well if we take there character and turn it against them. Will China ban the game and the dev who pandered entirely to them? That would be just so sweet.
Why Mei? Just because she's fat and Chinese?

Why not Tracer who's a Brit?
Great choice in a mascot reddit geniuses. Mei voice actor is literally not for a free hong kong lol. Who would of guess though a reddotor didn't do any research. Past posting memes.
Cute
And nothing will change,now back to home to play overwatch
What a terrible protest. It just goes to show that liberals really have no idea how to protest because they're too busy wanting to be nice. You're supposed to go out there, disrupt shit, and put your body on the line. They should have been standing in front of doors and forming human chains to prevent people from getting in. They could block off hallways, too. Instead, they're just passing out shirts and looking awkward. No wonder no one gives a damn.

Also, so much for this Blizzard boycott, Lol.
Overwatch 2 is damage control, nothing else...
Well at least this people have more tegridy than most gamers
Hell yeah!
where did they get the truck
Keeps telling me to sign in with a google account when I’m on my YouTube account (which is a google account).
I would but someone is fapping into the mic.
This stream is pathetic.
4:41:10

lmao
Yo that’s the most effective shit
dozen*
Doesn’t really seem ominous. Just more business as usual.
The police will do nothing unless it becomes violent, the city already stopped by and gave the protesters their full support.
Per that article, it's grown a bit as the day's gone on to around 50 people. And interviews with people in the hall find them generally supportive of the protests, even if they're not, you know, letting it stop them from enjoying Blizzcon.
I would totally grab a t-shirt. Those look awesome.
The outside of any convention is political so people learn to ignore it no matter what it is
Checked it out at lunch, protestors kinda disappointing. A lot of people taking pics of cosplayers and you see the protestors all to themselves, everyone ignoring btw.  Really sad display...
I think you mean, it needs more support. Let’s go people!
Honestly not surprised at the end of the day people can only truly care about things that cause them suffering. Now the outrage is over the biggest problem is those who make them feel bad for liking a game.
I wouldn't call it ominous but a given that courting Blizzard supporters is going to result in not a lot of people wanting to rock the boat and openly protest inside by wearing a shirt/sticker. Do people who pay for Blizzcon entry want to immediately jump at the chance of, possibly, being asked to leave the event they paid for because they wore a protest shirt? Probably not. 

It's very important to still be there and be a constant reminder of what Blizzard stands for but expecting convention goers to jump on board en masse is probably asking too much.
There's nothing ominous about it. The protestors just aren't actively protesting anything. "Want a free Mei T-shirt? What size? Here you go." One guy tried yelling for a bit, but he seemed kinda at a loss, for what he wanted changed, or wanted people to do. There's no anger, or yelling, crying, etc, like we've all kinda gotten used to. Just here's a shirt dude, enjoy the con. They just as easily could of been handing out Diablo 4 shirts. 

They aren't actually blocking anything, so anyone actually walking on the sidewalk will naturally just walk past them. There's no detour here. Just stay on the sidewalk, and literally 10 feet later you're in the security check line.

At least the T-shirts were made in the USA. With them handing out thousands of them, it kinda turned into a gag. Like "I bet the shirts are all made in China."
The police isn’t ignoring us - We are in constant communication with Anaheim PD, to ensure everything goes smoothly and is done right.

No protestors is blocking anyone off, as that was one of our main values - We want to be heard, seen and hopefully understood - Not to cause disruption and frustration.

That’s also why you don’t see us inside chanting, disrupting whatsoever.
> It's a bit ominous. 

I can't stand it when redditors speak like this.
do they let people with those T shirts in ,do they check ? I guess they not letting them in even with tickets ?
Do protester have a permit outside the building?
Seriously, I'll take any free swag I can get, and if it's something positive that might help spread a message worth spreading then it's a win-win.

&#x200B;

its close. But i am sure EVERYONE is ripping these ideas off for a quick buck.

Edit: I was told these are probably made in China. Read the posting. Seller has u/ for designer and someone else. Can check their stuff. I'm not buying bit if you do you should look into it more sure.
I would love to have one of those shirts.
i need the shirt too!
I would love a free shirt
I also want what this man is requesting
This please
I’ll take two
I mean free is free hahaha just in case
Yeah. They did so much to help Hong Kong. They sure showed China.
Awwwww. Love!
That’s right, I personally am boycotting blizzard, who’s games I enjoy very much, because they’re propping up totalitarian bullshit.
Not enough that millions of people won't buy Diablo 4 and Overwatch 2. Like it or not, those of us who are opposed to Blizzard's handling of the Hong Kong situation are still in the global minority. They will push millions of units and make billions of dollars from these two games regardless. It sucks, but that's the harsh reality of things.
I'm not convinced when all of Blizzard's new cinematic and trailers are dragging all over the front page, with every commenter frothing at the mouth and opening their wallet as soon as they see a new game, honestly. 

That's not to say that nobody is boycotting and that the movement isn't going to be at least somewhat effective, but there's one or two posts on the front page that's anti-blizzard, and about six that a pro-blizzard.
I deleted everything Blizzard and trashed all merch I have ever owned. They want to throw away the company by taking a stance against human rights? Well let me lend a hand ...
What's even more stupid is people who get mad for "bringing up politics".  Like yeah, Blizz did that first, that's part of why there is a protest.
I used to spend a decent amount of money in hearthstone, and now I’ve deleted my act. My discord friends have done the same. A few acts may not seem like much but our combined efforts will make a difference.
Yep. I ended my time in Hearthstone and Diablo (long time fan, own all games), won't be back until Blizzard actively rescinds their choices. I guess if the Blitzchung ban ends after time served I will just have to boycott forever :c
Still playing wow classic. Bought virtual ticket. Will buy D4.
For real though. I know people who I never thought would care about these things drop it because of this
No appreciable effect*

There, y'all semantic nerds. You and your buds dropping out of a few subs ain't putting a dent in anything.
Has blizzard made a statement acknowledging it yet?
It had a marginal effect at most.

People were hyping up the protests to be something huge instead it's like a dozen people giving out free shirts that nobody in the actual convention is wearing.

No one cares, despite Reddit's delusion.
Was gonna get Warcraft 3 remastered but skipping, now. Not playing OW anymore, either.  
  
Am I going to make an impact on Blizzard? No but I just don't want to support their company so I'll just play other games.
it might affect blizzard. it wont affect china. dont be dense. you wanna free those people? go to DC tell trump to invade china anything else is just theatre
I haven't played video games in ages but if I ever come back I'm sure as hell not playing anything blizzard lol
I was gonna get back on the blizzard wagon with Overwatch coming to Switch. They saved me $80 Canadian.
"Affected" is a broad word. If I lose a breakfast I am affected, but it's fine if I have breakfast every other day of the year.

I'm not saying effort is pointless, but the reality is, videogames as an industry is bigger than the HK cause. 

Yes, posts getting 30k upvotes on Reddit is impressive (for Reddit) but there arw roughly 164 million gamers in America alone. Even if every upvoter, without downvote balancing, had cancelled their suscription, it is still a drop in the bucket.

Are they affected? Yes. Is their bottom line affected? No, not really.
How has Blizzard been affected by this exactly?
100%  All Blizzard software has been removed from console, phone, and PC.  I got my account delete confirmation email last week.  SW:TOR is getting my sub cash now and the are out a constant xpac buyer and multi platform purchaser.
I did as well. This is also the first year since they started offering it that I haven't purchased a virtual ticket for Blizzcon.
I canceled.
Not really. Their stock has been steadily climbing despite these people quitting. Why? Because most people aren’t quitting and those that say they are, aren’t. 

Unfortunately consumers dictate success and most consumers have decided that they don’t mind the Hong Kong story.
Now compare that to losing the entire Chinese market and you understand Blizzard’s dilemma.
I dropped wow and overwatch and now with the new overwatch and wow coming out I know I won't be going back
What kind of logic is that? Do you have actual numbers of how Bilzzard was affected?

I have 3 friends that canceled and I've read on Reddit that there were more!!!
Same. I spent $500 on overwatch loot boxes then deleted my account to show them what's up. I did that 3 more times with new accounts. I spent 2000 but I'm sure they got the message. #freehongkong
Pisses me off that asmongold gives no fucks. He’s all about the $$$$.
This controversy has had no effect
Yeah, sorry but no. You can't touch these corporations by "voting with your wallet."

Most people, especially comfortable Americans, don't give a single shit about the lives of people outside of their bubble. See centuries of the US government funding death squads in latin america, having virtually no effect on American politics.
My stock has suffered so much because of you gamurrs pls stop :( /s
Bunch of hypocrites. CoD breaking records.
If Blizz didn't do this I would also definitely have bought a virtual BlizzCon ticket like usual.
Same, dropped hearthstone like a brick after playin since launch.
Boycotting also. Glad I did the new expansion looks lame
Meanwhile Diablo and Overwatch subs are excited about the upcoming games. Guess that's the extent of activism.
Yup same here. I’m not going to buy any more Blizzard products. But I’m not going to shit on others that do. I can control myself, not others. Although I hope others will join me.
Do you still use google? Do you still but literally anything? Congrats, you have had way worse impact on the lives of Chinese people than Blizzard who only enacted a contract literally every single Esport title company forces onto their players.           
So yeah, excuse me, you brave hero, saviour of Hong Kong if I can't empathize with you, when selfishness and grandstanding are the only logical explanation for your behaviour. Because I HIGHLY doubt that you seriously believe, deep down, that you are helping anything or anybody.
>  I know a number of people who dropped wowclassic and canceled their subs. Myself included.

No one cares.
Can you get more people to drop out so I don't have to deal with queues when I try to login?
Which pales in comparison to their Chinese customers
Wow if you really think the few people thah cancel their sub did something ... jesus. Noone cares now everyone has forgotten about it.
Did you post this message from your PC or Smartphone of which 0 of the parts or components were made in Chinese sweatshops?
OH no, how will a company ever survive...  
There are still ques on servers, whether they make 1.3 billion or 1.2 billion yearly it's not gonna bother them is it.
I’m sure it helped with you not giving them 15 dollars :)
I think most people are just having a hard time distinguishing between China and the Chinese people and the CCP. 

Most people actually hate the CCP. As far as the majority of the world is concerned, however, the CCP effective is China.
Nobody cares, it's trendy to shit on anything Chinese now so...
That's why most people hate the CCP.
Context is real important here. Did she say this literally right after blizzard banned the guy from HK? Or was this a one-off thing that happened another time? Also, source?
Didn't she outright post that she doesn't believe the big atrocities that China has done?

I mean, I guess she has to, to not fall under the bad radar of China. But she still did.
Quick reminder she denied that the uyghurs muslims were being murdered in concentration camps.
Needs Shang Tsung voice.

Also Robin Shou (the guy who played Liu Kang) is from Hong Kong.
In case you didn’t see, the first announcement was the president of blizzard getting up on stage and addressing the issue. They’re not hoping people forget, they literally brought it up themselves.
Why did they upvoted this to the top of the front page...
you cant farm karma that easily anymore dude, try 2 weeks ago
Or it’s a bit farm that keeps boosting these to the front on subs with tiny subs. I mean it was at 14k with about 100 comments from a sub with under a few hundred online.
"How does vote fuzzying work and why don't I understand it"
Ditto!
Sounds a lot like people protesting China outside Blizzcon in sunny California... get on the plane and take the trip... to China.
Must have been a wumao
Weird you think China could afford more than one.
That is ... not how reddit works, my dude.
Gamers rising up 👊

All 6 of them
That’s what I heard from my friend there today. It’s easy for people to say “I hate Blizzard!” online. But how many of them would stand outside in the sun rather than go and have fun at the convention...?
Good job
They were at a single entrance, so anyone entering from katella didn't ever even see them.
Probs standing around the westburough Baptist protesters who are there every year.
I don't understand, he said "actions matter more" but what actions are Blizzard taking?
That wasn't an apology for the blitzchung situation, was apology for getting caught. If they really wanted to apologise, they'd reduce blitz's and the casters' ban to zero
It’s not an apology. It’s empty rhetoric.
>Actions matter more

>We'll do better **next time**
source?
Think it's pretty clear.

Talk about anything political gets you banned on this non political platform
None of the 30 plus year old kids there were in the bandwagon to begin with. Redditors typically prefer to stay at home and are also alot more minority than they really think.
Thank you. The people that care for Blizzard titles couldn't care less for all of this. Frankly, I'm bored of hearing about it. What do people want Blizzard to do at this stage? The president has now publicly apologised what do the protestors want next? :/
High five fellow deleted
Eh you're not missing much by quitting.
Same here.
damn, you won't get to transfer all your skins for OW 2. Shame
I've been surprisingly productive and happy since I stopped playing.
How do I delete my Overwatch or Blizzard account?
> but they won't get my play hours

They don't make money off of play hours...
That's not an apology and they didn't mention hong kong once, it's a statement made so people like you can hail them as good guys.
And yet they still punished blitzchung
[removed]
D4 wont be out till 2024 at least and OW2 is nothing more than a Patch.
Well no one was censored in America to begin with sooooooo
if you start protesting when you clock in to your job on Monday do you think they are going to “censor” you?
teccchhnically blizz stocks havnt even recovered from the immortal crash

*but they certainly didnt fall when the blitzchung incident happened*
You support Hong Kong?

- Hong Kongers are being killed by the Chinese government

- The Chinese government ordered Blizzard to punish an American citizen

- Blizzard agrees and apologizes to the Chinese government, thus, Blizzard has chosen to align themselves with said government

- You buy games from Blizzard, and therefore are supporting a company that turns a blind eye to a murderous government

You don't support Hong Kong.
What new game? The sequel to that dogshit D3? The mobile Diablo that went over so well last year?
I hate slactivism as much as the next guy but going out, handing out t-shirts and literally holding up signs for hours is not what I'd call slactivism.
[removed]
[removed]
It's a peaceful protest. What the hell do you want them to do? Burn down the venue?
Let's do that next and address this first. Easy.
Don't hear a peep about Disney and their endless litany of bullshit.
or they just want to have fun and play some video games. That too

edit: also judging by your comment history you are very interested in a diablo t2 remaster lol.
yup- ask someone to grab one, they pay them to ship it to you
There’s a difference between not caring and not wanting to spend $1500 to fly there and stay in the area
Yep
Awfully excited for a sequel for that pile of trash D3.
Sure but you got to pay for shipping
Looks like someone didnt wait 10 seconds before typing KEKW.
china DOES however care about image. The whole point here is to force not china but BLIZZARD to take a stance, otherwise they're gonna get banned in china over their image being used to protest the chinese government.
*Obviously* this is about putting pressure on Blizzard and other Western companies that kowtow to the CCP. I don't know how you could possibly think people are trying to get Dictator Xi to have a change of heart about freedom and democracy.
Don't project onto those of us who care about this enough to do something about it. I don't think Blizzard will change, they will follow the money, but I still won't buy their games, even if they look great. This is more important than gaming for some of us.
D3 was garbo, why would people buy D4?
Nice try, Blizzard...
Yeah il just pirate all blizzard games from now on
Maybe they'll actually do something to help the situation between now and 2024 when Diablo IV actually comes out. 

In the meantime, nah, I won't buy anything else of theirs.
Speak for yourself.
What's your favorite Blizzard game?
nope, closed my account over a week ago. they're not getting any money from me again.
"We love Chinese money"
Must have been awkward claiming blizzard will kill off mei this blizzcon to not offend China only to see her everywhere
Yeah those are video game subs they care about the new game releases imagine that.
I mean the crazies took over this sub, they can probably do the same to the other subs
Guilty...
Try Yemen, it's closer to home since American bombs are being dropped there.

Yemen what...?
After that pile of trash D3 turned out to be, I question how many people still care about Diablo 4
it's not just Diablo 4 but  also Overwatch 2 and a new Wow expansion.
But Diablo 3 was terrible. Why would Diablo 4 be any better? The talent that made Diablo 2 is long gone. They don't make good games anymore, they make money.
More like redditors usually are the kind that prefers to stay at home
>I'm curious what they think they are going to accomplish here...

They think blizzard is going to tell HK that they get their demands. Because these epic gamers and redditors have confused blizzard with the chinese goverment.
If you check out r/blizzard or the subreddit for many of their games, primarily r/hearthstone, you realize that many players have cancelled their WoW subscription, dropped Hearthstone, etc.
More like 20 tbh
OK, I totally agree. China is horrible and I hope HK residents are successful in their protest.

I refuse to be delusional in thinking that protesting a private American Company that make video games is going to do jack shit for HK residents.
For the ban? It was china pressuring an American company so both. Pretty sad an American company complies with a regime. They released 2 apologies. 1 to western and one to Chinese audiences. The western was just an empty apology when you look at the Chinese letter.
Event is going without a hitch so far!
Why would he theres like 10 people there lmao
Ooooh a sinocel in the wild
Did you forget to change accounts? If not I think your name says it all
You dont get the point. We all agree blizzard action is shitty. If you want to boycott blizzard do it. However what is the point of this protest? what is the end goal? for blizzard to go out and free hong kong?

The whole gamer for freedom is a goddam joke. It one thing to boycott blizzard and it another thing to claim you and hong kong protest are the same and act like you action will free hong kong. Instead of actually pressure the government to do something about it, you here protesting at blizzard and act like blizzard can do anything.
It doesn't matter if it's one or one thousand. You stand for what you believe in regardless of how "dumb" you may look. Concerns of vanity and looking "dumb" is the real sheep mentality here, its why the world is the way it is in a lot of places.
What did you expect them to do about Mei? Delete her from the game?
Kaplan is just a developer though
Lol people are scum because they want to just enjoy a video game in their few hours of free time while they're not slaving away at work? I would say you're scum for acting like people should all do what you say they should do. I'll be playing Diablo 4 but I still hope Hong Kong works out. Like I hope the even worse protests going on in the middle East where people are being blown up and shot for protesting works out. But I know you don't care about that because all you care about is the Reddit karma from supporting Hong Kong.
yeah, so much for all the talk about blizzard banning mei
It's almost like fully-animated short films (8 minutes-ish for the OW one) take a while to make and can't be drastically altered at the drop of a hat.
It's almost like fully-animated short films (8 minutes-ish for the OW one) take a while to make and can't be drastically altered at the drop of a hat.
You care that much go protest. I’m sure everything will change
Let's see proof of you doing anything more then to back that attitude?
.... At BlizzCon?
They're...

They're at blizzcon, dude.
Are you gatekeeping protesting?
> In fact, Blizzard's stance is the exact *opposite* of this: they oppose democracy. 

What a load of horseshit and you know it.
Woo you came to that conclusion from a player getting punished for breaking the rules of a tournament. WOOOOO nice imagination. You support democracy so much go to HK and protest
Lilith WOOOOO
Except quite the opposite is happening, right as we speak
You clearly need to go out to the real world that is not comfort of your back yard. China have very tight control of censorship. As long as Blizzard do not make Mei official symbol of Hong Kong, nothing you do matter. China can differentiate between Blizzard action vs the protestor action. All your action will just be consider reactionary and be disregard
?????????

??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????

lmao what?

Mei is being used as a symbol because the voice actor is from Taiwan and she's not fat.
That wasn't the point at all. The point was to force a public image of the character into supporting HK. Whether the character, voice actor, original concept artist, or anybody else did or didn't, you push that public image so that way it gets tainted and China bans it, hurting Blizzard's bottom line.
I \***should've**\* expected this kind of stupidity from someone who doesn't know what a contraction is.
Two birds one stone
It's 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!
Lol, maybe this means she’ll be out of a job when China bans Mei. Then we’ll see if she supports their authoritarian bs.
They totally made that game in four months just for "damage control".
It's going to be an interesting weekend
Basically anyone can hire those kinds of things. They’re basically just movable video billboards.
"Ominous" as in "people are memoryless idiots who don't care about humans rights abuses."
I think in context, ominous was referring to the [appearance of the protest truck.](https://i.imgur.com/GlrR9Tl.png)
Same as the "Jesus saves" protestors, then.
The convention center is owned by the City of Anaheim, there really isn't anything Blizzard can do about it.  Since it's government property, people are allowed their first amendment rights.
Oh, in that case blizzard should hire a bunch of people wearing that free Hong Kong shirt and start trouble. Learn some west Taiwans tactics
but you have to have a  permit from the private building else you get fine.
We are all ok with it if nobody is violent =)
What? I’ve gone to countless conventions and never seen anything political??? I have seen people preaching to me about God, but never anything like this. What conventions have you been to where this occurred?
And it looks like just a dozen protesters or so promoting memes.
Lol what?
what did they expect to happen? 

OH RIGHT, they expected like 95% of the people at the convention to all get up and walk out during the talks, or shout and scream so much that *no one in the venue will be able to hear anything*

ahahahah
Or, hear me out, we could *not* give money to the people we’re boycotting
Just don't disrupt people there who just want to enjoy blizzcon. 

No issues with the protest outside.

Cheers =)
you mean you can't take it when the article says it?
we can all say things that aren't true by saying I guess, it's amazing
They use Gilden shirts that are made in the USA.
Yes, those are printed by me! I personally print the shirts at home in Canada. Any proceeds will go towards charities in Hong Kong :)
It would be hilarious to me if a factory in China was printing Hong Kong protest shirts.
What did you do to spread awareness today?
It brings awareness to the situation in Hong Kong, and that companies can choose who they wanna do businesses with - Just like is consumers can choose who to do businesses with.

Many of us aren’t interested in supporting a company who sells out western values for China.
[deleted]
Same here. Sorry overwatch, see you later!
Yeah me too. I'm also still boycotting ea for the most part, even though relatively they're not as bad.
Worst part is D4 actually looks promising, though GGG will surely crush it with the next PoE announcement.
[deleted]
Ya i made my parents buy Cod instead of me
it is gonna take a D2 caliber of game to get me back. and they don't have that in them anymore. I am perfectly happy not supporting them.
Yeah me too. I'm also still boycotting ea for the most part, even though relatively they're not as bad.
You obviously are behind in the news
You know Blitzchung has signed a deal to play HS professionally for a team right? like, he knew he would get in trouble for protesting, but he's clearly not as against Blizzard as a lot of other people.
Just out of curiosity, if you were truly 100% boycotting Blizzard, why are you in a sub that celebrates everything Blizzard?
"propping up totalitarian bullshit". How so? 

Maybe you don't agree with Brack on how he handled it, or their reasons for the suspension (which were in place before the protests), but it's a little bizarre to think that it's some totalitarian conspiracy.

I think we made our voices loud and clear, and they actually listened to us, so I think many of you are placing your energy unwisely against a company that does more good than bad in the world.
I think they handled it very poorly, but I wont stop giving them money because I dont let politics affect my enjoyment of video games.

I do have my own political stances and I support Hong Kong from the comfort of my home. But these games that people have poured their entire lives and careers into are not politically aligned. Projecting hatred for a country's government onto anything even remotely neutrally or positively aligned with that entity just feels...wrong. It's a reaction lacking empathy. 

You are holding accountable an entire company for the actions of a very small group of management. It doesnt seem to me to be much more different than generalizing and negatively impacting entire races or religions over the actions of a few. The severity and penalties are different.(edit: but the reaction seems to be the same) 

You absolutely have the right to protest and boycott them. But some of the blanket vitriol in this thread is alarming.
Sure, it’ll start small but over time, it’ll grow.

Years ago, a small group of people stopped buying cow’s milk and started buying plant-based milk. They had limited options and everyone kept buying their regular milk. Now, years later, there’s almost equal space given to plant-based milk as cow’s milk in the store and many people are now buying both cow’s and plant-based milk. And the dairy industry is losing tons of revenue.

Regardless of your view on that, it’s a great example of how a small group of people letting their beliefs dictate their purchasing, over time, led to change.
Even if they lost the entirety of the west, the sales in China alone can keep Blizzard chugging along just fine.
Boycotting Blizzard is easy. I needed to stop playing wow anyway lol, and I hate most of their other games except SC. But I'll definitely be buying Diablo 4 if it's as good as it looks.
We have to do these things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.
To be fair they have already profited from you, so what do they care if you throw everything away?
I salute you for standing up for what’s right.
What an epic gamer moment
Ah yes, trashing the stuff that I bought, that will show them and it isn't wasteful at all!
Yet you seem to still enjoy the NBA, lol.
Blizzard is an American company. America is in several wars and have practically turned the Middle East into a Muslim graveyard. 
Lately the US have had the record of killing innocent  civilians in Afghanistan including a recent human rights watch report of CIA trained death squads taking the place of American led death squads in Afghanistan. 

I wonder why you are so quiet when all these human rights abuses have been going on for almost 20 years now? Is it because you’ve all been desensitized or just have some weird moral selectivity that magnifies the wrongs of other countries while minimizing the wrongs of your country?
Nice way to show you're anti-environmental.
When did they ever stand against human rights? When you argue from a place of fantasy you don’t have much of an argument. That’s why a whole of ten people showed up to protest, they were the only ones who really bought that crap.
still waiting for that difference to materialize itself
Same, I knew gamers would cave, but this time at least some of us will say that this is too far and draw the line in the sand.
Lots more in life than time consuming non-fulfilling Blizzard video games.
So edgy
As someone who had to give up an old friend after talking to him for a few days regarding his subscription to WoW classic, I just want to say thank you.

Too many people are too scared to live by their own morals and it's disgusting.
Nah I dont buy chinese crap off Amazon or anything like that. It's a process and of course some things cant be avoided. Never said I'm a savior of anything. I dont expect people to stop playing, I'm not stupid.. unlike your overly aggressive comment. I never even said a damn thing about helping people. Your whole comment is literally just assumptions from nothing lol fuckin weirdo.
That’s a great argument. “If you’re not doing everything, you’re doing nothing.” Whatever helps you sleep better at night.
> Do you still use google?

Google was kicked out of China for refusing to comply with their censorship requirements. You've actually provided a perfect example how it's possible for a company to act ethically in the face of economic incentives to do otherwise.
Blizzards stock has been going up the entire month. Reddits boycott a great success yet again.
Well, the Chinese  are groomed so that when someone said they hate CCP, they meant all of China. Including the people. And I guess that's what happen to most of us too?
Like niv said, many Chinese are indoctrinated to believe that their government is an inherent part of their identity, so when you say “Chinese ‘communism’ killed a lot of people” they say “don’t insult my country”.
Pretty much, they are treating the HK/China situation as completely black and white. When nice people in HK are scared to go outside because of rioters destroying things and harassing people who don't support them... Also remember when LeBron James made a neutral comment and then a bunch of HK rioters started being extremely racist towards him... But China bad HK good I guess.
Virtue signalers out in full force!
I have no I'll will to the commoners of China, but their government deserves to be hated for their concentration camps.
Do I get free Karma if I hate China? I am thinking making some YouTube videos about HK I hope you guys give me  lot of clicks. I hope you guys don't mind if I put some commercials in the video clips. I hope I get million views. YouTube clips gonna be uploaded soon I count on you guys to click it. I hope this post get gold. Please HK actevist give this post Gold, give me some karma I will write some bad sentence against China.
This was October 1st, before the blizzard drama, to celebrate 70th Chinese national day. The moment the Blizzard thing happend people started harassing her, Blizzard fans are insane never forget people sent death threats to Brigitte's voice actor because Brigitte was OP at the time.

Sorry I'm having a hard time trying to get what you're saying.

They're protesting Blizzcon at Blizzcon, not China at Blizzcon...
My comment goes back from when OP first posted this and there were only a few replies. The comments that were for the protesters had 0 karma and against them had +2 karma. Seemed like it was just one very disgruntled person to me.
about 12
none, was a non-apology, didn't mention the events, didn't acknowledged what they did wrong, just said a bunch of buzzword hoping the crowd would clap.
Uh...what action would you like them to take? Pretty positive (and thankful) that game publishers don't hold much sway in international politics.
Ahh, the Hulk Hogan apology.
I don't think the "they're just sorry they got caught" turnaround works here. They didn't do anything secretly lol.
They literally did do that though. No one cares about Blitzchung’s punishment anymore, not even Blitzchung. The issue is their quick response to China about upholding Chinese values, which is rather messed up.
I never even said it was a good apology. Calm your ass.
I mean, they did violate the ToS, and blizz did already reduce the punishment. I'm pretty sure they gave back the winnings, and I'm sure they reduced the ban to 6 months for the player and the casters, so they did step back, but they also don't want everyone to be giving political speeches when they win, so they aren't undoing the punishment entirely.
Are you sure? To me not even that was clear, he literally said nothing about it.
It's proper dilemma.

Bend the knee = more money, more room for growth, jobs and games.

Don't bend the knee = they only get our money. And a small group of western people will be "proud" of blizzard.
Because it was never about HK to Blizz, it was about HK to Reddit.
Lmao you people are like little children. BLIZZ SAY SORRY!!! Ok sorry. NO THATS NOT GOOD ENOUGH WE WANT YOU TO FULLY FUND AN ARMED UPRISING FOR THE PEOPLE OF HONG KONG!!!!
Why would they?
Yeah, no. You can stop trolling people now.
I'm still hyped
dont bring logic into this
> supporting a company that turns a blind eye to a murderous government

can you provide a list of large companies that don't?
Your version of supporting HK is the same as Facebook prayers and wishes. Your doing nothing except harping on people who want to play some games.
Haha if you think that black and white then there’s no point in talking to you. Tell me all the products you use in a daily basis and if you dig enough you’ll realize so many of the things that you enjoy are a byproduct of Chinese influence. Any movie you watch from Hollywood. Any large tech company ( because you’d be an idiot to ignore China in the tech industry).  And most video games. Show me how sinless you are and how perfect you are before you judge anyone’s allegiance lmao.

My morals and ethics aren’t represented and dictated via a brand or company. 

You probably didn’t do anything about HK until a video game got involved lmao arm chair warrior / slacktivist. Why are you even following the Blizzard subreddit ? To just hate on your computer? Go wash your neck beard, fam.
Blizzard enforced a rule. If a dude went up and said Vote Trump 2020 you'd likely be red faced and angry.
Lmao yes diablo mobile or whatever was poop but yes myself and many others are hyped to play Diablo IV LOL keep up that no fun allowed energy and staying upset. ☺️
Do we know where the funding for the shirts comes from?
>We might not like what this guy says, but is he wrong?

About the amount of people? Maybe not. Calling it "slactivisim"?  Yes. They took action. It would be "slactivisim" if they just posted bullshit on their Twitter feed.
You say that as if there isn't literal photographic evidence of exactly what this guy just described, lol
Hows life being an armchair protestor 5000miles away buddy
Its like 3 people bro. Kinda pathetic showing.
Ah, the old "whataboutism" defense.
Oh, I never claimed I cared about the controversy, I am just saying if you paid for a ticket to Blizzcon, your probably not going because of the China Drama.
I will pay if you can send me one! (Bay Area CA)
It is funny that people think branding some Blizzard's products with the word "Free Hong Kong" will make China immediately ban Blizzard.

If I take a picture of a can of Coca-Cola labelled with sticker of "Free Hong Kong", will China also ban Coca Cola? Same with any product you can think of.

Also, why do China want to ban Blizzard when the latter is desperately licking its feet, just because some pro-Hong Kong wants so? China is not that dumb, or it would not become the second-largest economy in the world.

So unless it is Blizzard who official declares that they are pro-Hong Kong and accepts to lose their market in China, the government over there won't do a thing.
You are very few, a minority, and you probably don't even know why Hong Kong is doing what it is doing.

You'll still probably watch all the videos of how awesome Diablo 4 is.
“Do something about it”?
LMFAO you aren’t doing anything you dipshit.
I agree. I didn't like D3.

I'm hoping D4 goes back to it's D2 roots.
Oh Zeus, I wish.
Cool.
Maybe, but until then, plenty of people will buy their games.

I know I will.
I do. I will be buying the games.
Probably Diablo 2: LOD, though, Brood War holds a special place in my heart.
Don't worry. Many more will want to rekindle their love for the Diablo universe.

They'll get plenty of my money but you, you boycott Blizzard without actually knowing anything about Hong Kong or China.

Sad.
:'(
D3 is one of the best selling games of all time
At launch, sure. It's a completely different game since Jay Wilson was fired.
you obviously don't play d3. they turned the ship around pretty hard with reaper of souls.
Yep. You're absolutely right. D3 was a flaming piece of dog shit.
Many players or many Redditors?
Never said this was gonna topple the Chinese Communist Party. The point is to not support a company that punishes a protest with crazy restrictions like a one year ban. Even if they cut that in half it was pathetic. If they would've just disqualified Blitzchung for breaking the rules I would've understood, but they clearly wanted to make an example of him. Plus they punished the casters as well.

Not caring about these things is why companies like Apple gave up their iCloud info in China to the CCP. Why in China Apple took out the Taiwan flag. Why an American like Morey had to retract his support of protesters in HK.

I don't want to support it. I think it's immoral, so I choose to boycott them. I'm not expecting to change anything, I just hope it has some effect if we all work together.
Nope. Net Ease handles the Chinese part of Blizzard and they made the calls.
I feel so bad for OVERWATCH and DIABLO. They are getting trashed and that part of the team never determined anything. But I still stand against Blizzard.
> For the ban? It was china pressuring an American company so both. 

Ah, so it wasn't that abusing their platform to send conflicting political messages was explicitly against the rules. Got it. Evil company is being puppeteered by Chinese. That's all there is.
Why would I change accounts? I can be critical against China, nobody says they are perfect, but this is pure propaganda nonsense.
I've already contacted my government about, and IIRC didn't the house or senate pass a bill or something like it in the US?

You're punching air.
>It doesn't matter if it's one or one thousand.

It does matter at least a little bit.
China is known for taking drastic measures from the slightest of criticism. They remove entire shows from their country if it criticized the government. So it's not a completely wild notion
Wait.. so you guys want her banned now??
[deleted]
Neither. Just watching
Idk you seem to be someone who is very against free speech and democracy. Especially since you have deleted various comments this very night when cornered about this exact situation. 

Go ahead, delete my account from Reddit ya power hungry dictator
Imagine thinking China is going to ban Mei. People in china don't see the same internet as you behind the great firewall and even if they did she still be in the US and EU and Asia clients....
Damn looks like she has a job for awhile now.
Anouncing it now is the damage control
If today was anything to go by, no its not.

> "Ominous" as in "people are memoryless idiots who don't care about humans rights abuses."

Wearing a T-shirt to a video game conference doesn't do anything about humans rights abuses.
but only if they affect your video games right?

the human rights abuse that happens in other countries (including your own) doesnt matter, aslong as they keep their mitts off your vidya
To be fair you aren't going to BlizzCon to shout about Hong Kong, you're going to BlizzCon because you've got 3000 hours on reaper and had a wow subscription for a decade. These are their most diehard fans for the most part and those people do not care as much as we the masses do.
> "Ominous" as in "people are memoryless idiots who don't care about humans rights abuses."

It's almost as if they're there for video games and don't want to get involved with 'gamers' who try to thrust politics into everything?
Stop being so hypocritical. Start yourself by stopping to use any product coming from China or being produced in China.
Right! Almost like posting to a social media platform supported by Tencent hahahahahah
Well, we are kind of conditioned this way. Plus we all generally participate in an economy where we own a lot of chinese stuff.
If they did as American voters and tax payers they would have made some dinstinct changes .... But we all know what happens when BLM protests happen and block a road or children are caged .. They will quack and sqwak to feel bit better and most funnily keeps throwing money at Apple, Nike and many other products made at Chinese sweatshops
In fairness not everyone uses Reddit and a vast majority of them probably don’t even understand what the protest are about.
Jesus Christ why do we need to force everything on everyone? Maybe some familys wanted to go check out the new overwatch and didnt want to have political issues jammed down there throats for a day. Like what do you people expect honestly its okay to escape reailty from time to time that dosent translating into not caring.
People want to live their lives so they're bad people for doing that? Not everyone has a over inflated sense of morality you nostril twirling pig trout
Just going to point out, the player that started all of this has just signed a deal to play Hearthstone professionally for a team. So does that make him a memoryless idiot who doesn't care about human rights abuses?
“memoryless”

If only there was a word for this...
What do you want someone attending a convention in America to do about freedom in hong kong?

Most of these tickets would have been bought months in advance, and they're $200, and for most people it will be the only big event they attend in a year and something they look forwards to all year. You want people to give all of that up because blizzard banned some dude who said free hong kong? Like it's going to make any difference for the people in hong kong?
or they don't think blizzard over enforcing their ToS is a humans rights violation...
I think that the people who paid to be there wanted to go inside and enjoy there advertisements
More like actively hateful.
Or most people just live their lives and realize nothing could be done if they wanted to. I decided that my enjoyment of a game is more important than something I can do literally NOTHING about.
[deleted]
Well if you are going to Blizzcon, you are probably one of Blizzards most die hard / sycophantic followers. 

Or you just don't care about the outside world.

Either way, it shouldn't be a surprise.
> Just more business as usual.

...

> "people are memoryless idiots who don't care about humans rights abuses."

Sadly..... I think you're both right.
yea im sure youve done alot besides comment on social media. keep up the good fight friend
like how your government put children in cages? yep
Let me guess, you do? China has been the poster child for civil rights violations since before either of us were even born, where was your faux outrage before the Blizz controversy?
Hey, unpopular opinion, some of us have jobs that need to get done and just want to get through the day without an incident so we can go home to our families and be thankful.
It is that the games they enjoy from Blizzard are their escape from this kind of shit. People just want their escapism snd this is an attempt to get in the way of that. 

Blizzard didn’t commit any atrocities against human rights and certainly hasn’t killed anyone. They banned a few people, temporarily, and took prizes for breaking rules. But the “no consequences” generation didn’t like that so they are crying about it.
I think you need to put into perspective that Blizzard isn't committing or even supporting human rights abuses. They banned a commentator for making a political comment in order to appease the government of one of their biggest client bases; a government that they would certainly rather not have deal with. And then they negotiated with China to reduce the ban.

Let's calm down.
Or people do care but they prefer to use other avenues of protest because games are just escapism to them.
also others who are extremely selective about what human rights abuses to stand up for
How's the weather up there?
Guys diablo 4 was announced! That more than makes up for it!
Or people who realize protesting blizzard does absolutely nothing to help or hurt anyone.
No, I think most people recognize that protesting Blizzcon does JACKSHIT for everyone in Hong Kong.

People who care actually help Hong Kong residents directly instead of this stupid indirect protest of a private American company.

The American division have already stated they had nothing to do with it. Why are you trying to rip them from their jobs? of creating video games? It's pathetic.

EDIT: 

How many of these protestors actually wrote to their members of Parliament? How many people [sent protective gear to Hong Kong?](https://old.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/ddf659/collecting_protective_gears_to_be_sent_to_hong/)

Nah - instead let's wear some T-shirts and boycott a private company. Such a farce.
Taiwans? This is literally the oldest and one of the most effective tricks in the book.
Police have a tendency to change that.
Blizzcon has a history of protestors. Diablo was very touchy for religious people back in the day.
I have also only ever seen religious people at conventions I have gone to.
>What conventions have you been to where this occurred?

All of them, even the dispursed one too
Are religious protests common outside conventions? I've been to a ton of religious conferences and there are always protestors outside.
maybe he is like an arms dealer or something
Westboro Baptist protest these things all the time.
THE OUTSIDE OF ANY CONVENETION IS POLITICAL SO PEOPLE LEARN TO IGNORE IT NO MATTER WHAT IT IS
We’re boycotting the protestors?
*how dare you, you should be preparing molotovs with the rest of us!*
Disruption is ***the point*** of protest.

If you aren't disrupting anything, you aren't actually protesting. You are just standing around having a hangout.
Yeah they can protests, as long as they don't actually make a difference though.
[removed]
*Just don’t disrupt people from supporting a dictatorship*
I agree some people paid alot of money and spent all their vacation time for that trip. I don't malign them at all for enjoying it while they can.
Perfect! Hopefully they aren't shipped to china to get printed on lolol jk. Ty for info. Maybe someone will get one if they can't make it to blizzcon now.
Awesome! Thanks for confirmation. Hope ya got some sales.
Haha I sure hope not. The page said they wanted to get to blizzcon so hopefully it's not that bad. I'm not buying either way.
They haven't spread awareness either
[deleted]
But protesting Blizzard does nothing to help Hong Kong. If anything it's a distraction from the real issue. If you want to help send money or supplies to those that are protesting. Being pissed at Blizzard or posting memes on the internet only makes you feel good.
You can still play ow1 with the new pvp stuff, just dont but microtransactions or the new pve mode.
I can live with what EA’s doing. There a shitty company making shitty games for money. Nothing new. But Blizzards taking it to a hole new level of shittyness
That’s really awesome that you’re willing to sacrifice for your convictions. Too bad there’s a 1000 morons for every one of you who jump on the band wagon under false pretenses and cheapen the resolve of the movement because they have no character of their own.
Just a bad publisher that forces incomplete games, I always wait a few weeks after release when they're attached
I can live with what EA’s doing. There a shitty company making shitty games for money. Nothing new. But Blizzards taking it to a hole new level of shittyness
I don't agree with the governments of Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, but I drive a car and use gas, some of which came from those countries. Does that mean I'm not allowed to point out and oppose what those governments do?

Put another way, why do you think a boycott has to be 100% in order to be moral or effective?

Still activision but probably better than playing a “blizzard game”
I’m not happy about it but I’m sticking to my guns here. Cyberpunk 2077 can’t come fast enough.
Diablo 4 looks good imo but not worth it. Let's see if hackers can get that one out for free so I can play it.
Lol, we found the EA bot. Welcome!
Oh, did they decide to support freedom of speech and note their support for Hong Kong? Or are they still censoring the shit out of everything in their games?
What is blizzard doing to help the people of Hong Kong against the fascist mainland regime?
Because I’m interested in their games - it sucks knowing I won’t be playing them but I’m a gamer so the curiosity is there. I especially wanted to check out diablo 4... bummed I’m not going to play.
So have they denounced that statement made by NetEase using one of the official Blizzard accounts? Because until they do that, they haven't listened at all for all I care. I might be wrong, though. Maybe Blizzard has done more than put out that weak non-apology from Brack.
I think the problem is more that the money being spent is supporting the suppression of HK, someone had compared it to chick-fil-a's anti-LGBTQ in another thread in this post and I think it's fitting; you may not morally support the anti-HK activity, but by spending money and padding blizzards pockets you are financially supporting the anti-HK activity
> You are holding accountable an entire company for the actions of a very small group of management.

You have to, otherwise nothing will change. You have to punish the whole company in order for the decision makers to get the hint.
Exactly.
Not from what I've seen. MarketWatch said activisionblizzard derives 5.2% of it's revenue from mainland China.
> Boycotting Blizzard is easy

-

> But I'll definitely be buying Diablo 4

🤔
They've already profited, but they've already spent that profit too. People not giving them future money *does* make a difference.
Should have sold the merch if it had any value and donated that money to help the protesters.
Lost future revenue, goodwill, my emotional satisfaction.
Lol you think they can keep running when they’re customer base turns off the money faucet? I’m not going to play overwatch 2 and I spent a shit load on the first. They can try and make it happen without my money. Best of luck you bootlicking fucks.
Monthly Active Users is a metric tracke, and reported during earnings, by most of these tach/software companies.
They gain to profit when people start replacing the things they destroyed. 

People are weak.
A heated gamer moment lmao
Stalk..errrr

Adam Silver didn’t suppress free speech. You wanna “well actually” people on morals? Lol I wont bite.
> You can't be totally morally correct, so why try to be morally correct at all?  

-- Typical "Yet you participate in society" Redditor
I know, right? I mean it's impossible that someone isn't on the hate bandwagon because the internet told them that they should.
What is a process? Also, THESE are the people that you try to support https://twitter.com/CarlZha/status/1183631556662849536          
Congrats on that, I'm sure they appreciate you cancelling your sub while they actively assault people for being Chinese.
Some people feel superior when they bring others down for doing the right thing when it doesn't immediately change the world. People like that are the type that think nothing is ever gonna change so they might as well do shit and just look down on everyone for trying, it's pathetic.
How much impact did that ethical behaviour have? Or are you suggesting that ALL companies should separate from China? Because if you think this is going to improve the situation you're as wrong as it gets.
Lmao, chinese police literally paid people to stage fake riots in order to muddy the water and delegitimize the protestors.

Congrats, you've bought into literal chinese propaganda.
What proof of rioters? What racist comments? All I've seen is police brutality and propaganda to deny it. HK isn't afraid of rioters. They're afraid of getting tear gased and murdered by the police. For fucks sake.....
I've never seen any rioters in HK PERIOD. Why wouldn't I see the most glaring evidence to paint protesters in a bad light anywhere? I'd imagine that shit would spread like wildfire if it was true.
From a human rights perspective, we can establish China (The CCP) is bad simply by looking at their re-education camps... But there's so much more to unravel. I'm disturbed by everyone who just says "haha china bad right??". Yes, the CCP IS bad. There shouldn't need to be a discussion anymore. If you are their model citizen, you'll be fine, but if you're not.... You're in serious trouble.

So HK is completely warranted in wanting to reduce China's grasp on them. They want to, ya know, not get kidnapped and re-educated and then gang raped by officers and/or become specimens for medical experiments and organ harvesting.

But yes, racism is wrong, but no, his comment wasn't neutral. He said that guy was uneducated on the situation, and looking at what I said above, that sounds like what someone who wants to keep making money off China would say, since if he was educated, he should be anti-china.

Edit; and just to completely clarify, yes, it was wrong of them to be racist. I'm not excusing it, because it's inexcusable. They can be angry at him, but why bring race into it, that's just wrong.
Just don't forget to post it on Reddit and it will go front page + viral in no time.
Damn. There's nothing I can say about that. I don't support China but I feel bad for both voice actors you mentioned. Especially since for the reasons they happened. Thanks for the info.
I’m not saying this makes it okay. I’m saying they’re not avoiding the issue.
Happens on many local subs. The 'alt-right invasion' post on r/Melbourne had a few comments that were immediately downvoted quite a bit, as well as anything in support of the IMARC Blockade protesters.
Wut?
Not the action, the reason. Please learn to look at a situation beyond the surface level
They didn’t overturn his punishment, he couldn’t even say ‘We want to apologize to Blitzchung’

Just.. nothing? It was basically a ‘hehe we messed up sorry won’t do it again ANYWAYS WE GOT 59 COUNTRIES PRESENT AT BLIZZCON!’
Blitzchung getting punished was never the issue. The fact that the severity of the punishment was dictated by china to begin with is the issue.
Human rights isn't politics
just a guess, the release date should be in 2021, and a release date announced in 2020
Or you know, they could simply be honest instead of saying empty words. Instead of trying to look better they could simply try to be better.

By the way, a good fan knows how to see the good and the bad in what they like. You aren't it.
They've been moving the goalpost since this whole shitshow started. 

From overreacting to supporting China to attacking human rights.
You're absolutely right. Many products in America come from countries that employ slave labor, and it's sickening. Chinese influence is everywhere.

I'm proposing to boycott a company that specializes in recreation. If you're unwilling to take even this one small step toward fixing the situation, then you've chosen to ignore the source of your enjoyment and you've become part of the problem.

I don't have all the answers, but I know that we have to start getting out of this arrangement *somewhere*.
Then don't say you support Hong Kong if you support a company like Blizzard. You're a goldfish.

We all enjoy fun but money talks, so we want Blizzard to see the reproduction to their actions, but people like you make that hopeless because all you care about is gaming. On top of that you make this seem like a joke. It's pretty sad how immature you are.
*Made in China*
which most of reddit did.
actually going out and protesting is literally the opposite of slactivism so no this guy is exactly wrong in every conceivable form
And yet here you are...
Ah, the old "whataboutism defense" defense.  I have no problem with Blizzard.  I'm not going to bother defending them again for no reason.

I have plenty of problems with Disney, but I don't expect reddit to give up their precious Marvel or Star Wars movies.
Are you familiar with the Christopher Robin film?
I watched the video on D4, it looks pretty good, sad I won't be able to play it. I do know why Hong Kong is fighting against the extradition bill and are taking to the streets, I do know the history of the city and the claims mainland China has had on the territory since British withdrawl, I do know the 5 demands that protesters have made to their Chinese sponsored leader, and I do know you are an arrogant shithead who I don't have to prove anything to. please slither back down whatever hole you crawled out of.
I'd probably place more of a bet on the other studios working in that genre than blizzard itself at this point. D3 at it's inception was a bit of a dirty cash grab. Although I hear they redeemed it somewhat with the expansions. Dunno guess we'll see.
another fool making baseless assumptions about someone they don't know on the internet.

i at least *try* to be more intelligent than that. yet people like prefer to show the world how stupid and ignorant you are.
Yet no one is playing it nowadays, and it got pretty much destroyed by PoE content wise.
It sold so many copies because people loved Diablo 2, so they were excited to see the sequel. The story in 3 was bland, the skill system was pretty weak and unbalanced, and don't even get me started on the auction house dumpster fire.

The sales figures also come from the sales of the original plus the expansion, which is a bit misleading.

All in all, I am very confident in what I said. The player count was eviscerated after launch. Reaper helped, but it never reached anywhere near what people were expecting. If they move 4 back towards 2 I would line up to play it. But they don't have that talent anymore. Those people left long ago
If the game was garbage when it came out, which it was, it's garbage in my mind. Idgaf if reaper redeemed it. Don't release a half ass game then fix it later. Postpone it if you must.

And this is coming from someone who has undoubtedly spent more time playing diablo 2 than any other game in my life.
Honestly it wasn't bad at all when it came out, just certain parts of it screwed with how **RE**playable it was. I don't know any Diablo players that quit before hitting the level cap or completing the story.
Ross didn't redeem that dumpster fire, it just doused a bit of the flame and threw air freshener to full the smell.



Is the story still shit? Yes. Did they do anything about character permanence? No. Does aesthetics still fit WoW better than Diabol? Yes. Is it still pathetically easy compared to prior games? Yes.
Not at all, was still trash. PoE was and still is MILES better.
It already did... they clawed back on their decision. So why are we protesting today?
True but they still haven't distanced themselves from said statement.
I feel bad for the employees. They seem to stand w America but the company doesnt. Cant imagine the stress they must mentally be going through.
Basically.
What bill did they pass? last years both parties unanimously vote to sanction russia for election interference. Where is the same thing for China? oh nothing.

You are the one who punch air my friend. Because at the end of the day Blizzard can't free hong kong. Either boycott their game and move on to bigger stuff.
Blizzard isn't China. As much as Reddit likes to believe.
Itd be pretty funny if they just made a "bug" where she was unselectable.
It's absolutely hilarious that people thought the whole Mei thing would gain traction, let alone that Blizz would give a shit.
I wanted her bammed because sometimes she is hard to counter in OW.
Wow I've never seen a sadder and more pathetic comment on reddit.

You do absolutely nothing and complain about protesters. Good job.
So only an annoyance who feels the need to share their opinion on things that don't concern them, then. Sounds a lot like how you'd probably describe the same people you're criticizing. 

If you can't think of any better argument than "just because you're not in the thick of it, your voice doesn't matter", then just keep scrolling and let those who believe in something do what they can to stand up for it, while you sit at that keyboard behind the safety of anonymity.
They're physically on site protesting, that is completely the opposite of internet slacktivism.
>Especially since you have deleted various comments this very night when cornered about this exact situation.

lol, I have done no such thing. And I wouldn't, because there's nothing to be "cornered" about. Blizzard did what any company or organization would do.
It's Blizzcon, it's kinda the type of thing they announce at THEIR OWN CONFERENCE
They announced it during BLIZZCON. A convention where they annouced their game. This is like asking why EA announced their game at E3.
i agree that part of it is this, but also another angle is the information exhaustion that our society experiences. 
This is an interesting perspective on the topic if you're interested further and it starts to apply about 1:30 in.

An animal has an evolved self when they recognize themselves in a mirror, knowledge of the self. Even more so when they recognize themselves in another. 

Like some sort of entanglement really.
Or until it affects them financially.
Most people go about their lives with the mentality " I want to do this today, I need to do this today". And will do so over the course of the day. In the process of doing that people tend to cover their ears and shield their eyes to every thing around them.

The suffering of others, is remarkably easy to ignore. Why care for someone's pain when you don't know them? Why care when you don't feel their pain? Why care when you can't see them? Why care when it doesn't involve you?

However, that only really works if the said problem is something they could not directly confront. If anyone went to a place where people suffer, see the event unfold and see the suffering of others. It becomes difficult to ignore, maybe even impossible, even when you take them out of that location. It is because they now have a memory, a very real one that will always strike at one's conscious.

I feel though, this is the biggest hypocrisy of humanity. We preach for freedom, justice and equality. We preach for humanity's greatest heroes. We preach for humanity's fictional heroes. We preach for heroes who stand by their fellow man, and always tell our selves to live like them, to change the world like them. To be better. Yet many could not even bear to lift a finger to live up to those ideals or even help others who lacks those ideals. Only when immediately faced with the exact opposite of what we preach do people even care. But by that point, what does it even mean to be human anymore if all we do is live in a lie that we ourselves constructed, forever unable to actually live to the standards of being human?
Im glad I’m not one of those people.
Today you, tomorrow me. 
Today them, tomorrow us.
People put things in order of importance. Facts are, people protesting in a country halfway around the world have zero impact on our lives. People waving signs and trying to disrupt your walk to get into the building so you dont have to stand in line as long DOES have an immediate impact on your life. If you are able to prioritize what is right rather than what affects you more then that makes you a better person.
Humans aren't supposed to care about people they don't know. I don't know why any of you would give a shit. I doubt you actually do.

The only thing that makes Hong Kong matter is the effect it has on global power dynamics and how that affects us.
we ignore the suffering of the other animals...
Where is your outrage for Yemen?  Where is your outrage for Chile?  For Venezuela?  Hong Kong is trendy, I get it, but if you actually want to cast wide swaths of accusations at people, accept this much: if you live your life taking pride in being sensitive and exposed to all such issues, you will inevitably be the hypocrite in that equation.

Maybe just worry about what you're doing about it and stop expecting shit from other people, unless you want someone rooting around in how much 'activism' you participate in when it comes to non-trendy issues.
Or they came to Blizzcon to get to the con and see all of the events and such, not give special attention to people handing out non-related propaganda.
It does do something. Maybe not enough. Maybe not much. But something.
I hate this thinking. Raising awareness of the issue helps. Sharing pictures, memes, news articles about what’s currently happening in HK makes sure it doesn’t disappear off the news, and spreads the news to people who haven’t been exposed to it yet. It definitely helps.
It raises awareness of it, that's something. And something is more than doing nothing but criticize their participation.
And pointing this out doesn't do anything for... whatever it is you care about. Yet, you're still here.

So, you're wrong, obviously. It makes people talk. About human rights.
3000? Casual af.

My main on WoW is coming up on 20k, and I know people with way more.
Imagine putting the peripherals down and thinking about the world and your place in it, the effect your existence and behaviour has on outside forces and their effects on you, the ethical structure you adhere to and if therein lies a duty to others as fellow beings, whether because of their humanity or because of yours. Ew. Political.
Everything is inherently political.
No it's about not supporting a billion-dollar company that supports a repressive horrific  regime.
Almost like they're there for video games, but the developer is their for money and in the middle of those 2 things recently human rights entered the crossfire. Imagine that!
to be fair blizzard did this to themselves.  expecting backlash to die down because you're mad at politics is silly
Politics thrusts itself into everything. That is the nature of life.
The impossibility of perfection shouldn't stop someone from trying to be better.
Oh cute, the Nirvana Fallacy
It's not the rights Blizzard abused, it's the rights Blizzard is supporting the abuse of.
Well they pulled a prize pool from a guy for supporting Hong Kong, so freedom of speech.
I care, but I didn't grab a t-shirt because it was crowded.

Perhaps most people just want to go attend the event. Again, just because a couple people made the quick and mindless decision to ban a player on the spot doesn't mean the whole entire company and fan base are mindless idiots or don't care.

The president acknowledged it and apologized. At least that's something.

We all want to support Hong Kong, but what can we really do besides agree with the message? Is anyone going out of their way to setup fundraisers or talk to politicians to get involved in HK? Besides the fact that most of our import are Chinese, what good would effectively declaring war on China do?
Thank you for noticing. I've been on ballots myself. I've canvased. I've led talks.
What's with people and this concept that caring about one thing is exclusive to caring about any other thing.
Exactly. Bettering the world is not a zero-sum game. That's also something that's awful and many of us do what we can to end it.
People can care about more than one thing.  Also that doesn’t happen.  Completely ignorant you should delete.
You donate to food banks? You donate to homeless  shelters? You adopt animals from the humane society or even just the pound? You do anything to fix someone's life who needs just as much help as immigrants?
Present. One of my strongest memories is watching the Hong Kong Handover (live, as it happened) in 1997 and realizing how much of a catastrophe it was going to be for those who lived there.
He means West Taiwan, as in China.
Weren't those paid protesters to increase interest/media attention?

Or did it like start with that but then the wackos actually picked it up
They’re not really protests, it’s just a group of people shaming others for enjoying things. They typically shout, “Save yourself from hell!!!” They also recite things from the Bible.
Lol, do you seriously think all protestors in Hong Kong throw molotovs? Can you not tell the difference between protest and riot?
Some of the people who are protesting online seem to get angry when you don't agree with their narrative. It's like we all have different opinions. Strange.
I feel like you can inform/raise awareness without being disruptive.
Blizzcon ticket sales started in May this year. Some people would have started planning to travel to Anaheim months before the Blitzchung incident and invested large amounts of money in unrefundable bookings. They don’t deserve to have a shitty weekend just so a relatively small group of people can feel like they’re “sticking it” to Blizzard.
Sure. How do you think they should disrupt the event? Force their way in?
Disrupting **the individuals responsible for whatever you're protesting against** is the point of protest. If you're standing in the middle of a street or a convention and annoying random people, all you're doing is pushing people away from your cause. Go stand in front of J. Allen Brack's or Bobby Kotick's driveway if you want to protest against Blizzard's statements.
Yep. Protests are generally allowed, until they start to make a difference, and then *bam* the state outlaws them. Look at poor Hong Kong and the oppression the Beijing puppets, the HK police, are throwing at them.
I mean, you can invite them to your place, others can too.

What are you suggesting those protesters do by the way?

Just curious
I think it’s slightly disingenuous to say that the people who are going to blizzcon just to enjoy it are supporting dictatorships but okay?
You’re calling Blizzard a dictatorship?  Or are you saying that not protesting/boycotting a company that doesn’t go against a dictatorship is supporting the dictatorship?  If it’s the latter, that’s a very slippery slope, and by the same logic you are undoubtedly supporting many things you don’t approve of with the countless products you use.
Did you type that from you made in China iPhone or Android phone

Seeing as how there are numerous articles on the topic now from relatively large news sites, I’d say they did their fair share at doing something they believe in.
Every group always has:

Opposition: those who think it’s stupid and is against it

Neutrals: not for/against, aka you do you

Interested: They listen, join whatever group it is - But eventually will lose interest, and move into something new

Followers: They support the movement as a whole, and aren’t afraid of voicing their thoughts - These will most likely also fall off over time

The passionate: often the leaders and die-heads - and depending on circumstances can also be called extremists - They won’t let anything go, because they’re emotionally invested in this, and it becomes personal.

It’s usually 10% Opposition

60% Neutrals

25% Interested/Followers

5% Passionates

Ofcourse it will always vary, but this is roughly how the majority of movements are no matter what it’s about.
[deleted]
Yeah like a butthole level of shittyness
The movement doesn’t happen on its own. I have a ton of friends who play everything with me and if 1 or 2 of us don’t get a game we play something else. I’ll just stick to Apex for now.
Thanks c:
“everyone who doesn’t agree with me in every way is a moron with no character”
Yeah me too. I have apex a go since it had good behaviour at the start, but gave it up again as it got worse.

I’m torn thought causw BFV just released pacific
Lmao the irony. Can't support Blizz because morals but then waiting for a CDPR game?
Honestly, crackers would be delivering the superior product, given that it would almost certainly have the always online part stripped out.
its always online

it wont happen
There you go. Stealing something shows your support for HK.
Beep boop ea bad beep boop.
What is valve doing to help the people of Hong Kong against the fascist mainland regime?

What is ea doing to help the people of Hong Kong against the fascist mainland regime?

What is McDonalds doing to help the people of Hong Kong against the fascist mainland regime?

Maybe, rather than targetting all their effort against a single video game company, people should write to their Members of Government, demand action.You know why America's Trade Tarifs are hurting Chinese and American companies? because America does a ton of trade with China.

Thing is, what do people \*want\* Blizzard to do here?

\- Reverse their penalty? - Blitzchung himself said he knew he was breaking the rules, expected there to be consequences and still a few weeks later signed a deal to be a pro-hearthstone player for a team

\- Do something more? like what? pull all trade out of China? do you think this would harm anyone but Chinese gamers? the normal dudes like you and me who like playing video games?
I do understand that as a moral dilemma. I've seen this discussion in the past with Chick-fil-a, Hobby Lobby and others. What concerns me in this instance is how aggressive and cynical people are being about this. Not just in this thread, but any time this comes up. 

I do understand that it is a loud, passionate minority doing these things. Maybe this is just how the internet is now that activism and outrage culture have blended together. For many, there seems to be no room for reconciliation of what happened. That Blizzard deserves nothing from anybody after this mistake. It's happened little in this thread, but in others people are downright attacking others for supporting the events by simply playing games they enjoy. 

It's not that I disagree with the sentiment. I just don't agree with the extremism. I don't think the management at Blizzard wanted to make a political statement any more than I want people to take my purchase of Overwatch 2 or Diablo 4 to be support of a totalitarian regime. I think the majority of people just want to forget about politics or their existential dread for a while and explode some demons.
You can demand results from those responsible. You can be a shareholder and make noise at shareholder meetings. Be very specific in your complaints and direct them to the people you feel are responsible. It's like using a shotgun blast when a pistol will do. 

However, as I said in another comment, it doesnt seem to matter how Blizzard acts from here on out. The mob mentality seems to be that they are not willing to forgive.  Blizzard will not win those people over. 

If a group of people want to hold an entire company responsible but won't accept multiple apologies and admission of wrong doing from that company, even tentatively, then I don't know what any of us are doing here. There hasn't even been time enough to determine how seriously they are taking this. It's just assumed they are disingenuous. Mistakes shouldn't HAVE to ruin lives and careers in order to be a learning moment. Wanting someone to lose their job or wanting an entire company to be dismantled because you believe that's the only acceptable resolution...that's not something I can get behind.
Sure but I haven't seen this protest advance onto neither the Activision branded titles nor the King branded titles which are typically the ones that would preform better in the west.
> People not giving them future money does make a difference.

I mean yeah but... have you seen OW2?
The money was reinvested and has helped them generate more. It only makes a difference when you convince a majority of their consumers to stop. A few thousand redditors makes no difference.
And the free advertising they'd get from you wearing merch and publicly supporting them. Good on you, don't let people who think like this get in the way of what you believe. Any difference made is still a difference, even if it's minute.
Lmao, get a hold of yourself bud.
their customer base hasnt turned off the money faucet

*you turned yours off*

take a grain of sand from a beach

see the difference? no?
Speak for yourself, finding an alternative game in today's market is pie
Ya it's illogical, but so is throwing out everything you've ever owned from a company you used to love, and then just flick on the TV and watch the NBA with a big grin on your face wearing a Lebron James jersey. I guess that is type of "typical" Redditor as well. Selective outrage.
It's not impossible, you do you. But it's funny that you feel the need to take the time to comment in contrary, so instead of the "hate bandwagon" that you very vocally despise so much, you hopped on the "anti-hate bandwagon bandwagon". Hence the edgy comment, I presume.
That's not the weird part. What's weird is sounding so *proud* of it.
You've now completely changed your argument, but okay.

Many companies today sells products that don't pose an ethical risk. Nike's shoes cannot be used to oppress the people of China or Hong Kong, so it can operate quite freely.

Google couldn't serve censored search results in China without being ethically compromised. Google knew that and so they did the right thing.

Blizzard needs to find an ethical way to make money in China or leave the market like Google. It's that simple really.

This is the problem though, the CCP is bad but the general consensus on reddit and seem's far more racist and hateful towards just China as a whole. I don't like the Saudi Government doesn't mean i hate their citizens, people want to an excuse to hate a company they used to like and it happens that Hong Kong's situation is linked to it.

I ain't no /r/sino poster here where every little thing about China is perfect and every bad thing is Western Propaganda, but this feels so blown out of proportion when Blizzard didn't do anything serious and Blitzchung himself seem's fine with the decision.
“Re-education” camp popped up around 2016.  Prior, there has been several terrorist incidents killing many Chinese citizens in that region.  Camp is likely in response to ongoing terror activity.  Is it right, up to you to decide, but when you fight a totalitarian heck even a republic government, the government will fight back hard.  Just look at gitmo.


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism_in_China

This is not agreeing to these concentration camps, however these camps did not just pop out of the blue.  Maybe it was planned maybe it was a reaction.  Either way, Reddit and most media don’t like to point out the preamble that led to current event.
They didn't even mention his name.   
They did avoid it by simply not shutting up after saying the first two sentences and about how they'll improve in the future and how bla bla bla.    
All they did was acknowledge that they're wet, didn't acknowledge that that's because it's raining and want to change that but haven't even moved under a roof or opened an umbrella
Ditto's description
They're sorry they got caught... enforcing their TOS? Like, that's the literal reason. Which makes them look even less "grr evil", I know...
>Blitzchung getting punished was never the issue.

I was responding to a post calling for removing the punishment entirely, so it seems that is the issue at this point. I agree that the extreme initial punishment was bad, but they did step it back to something much more reasonable. I know that I'm not likely to convince many people here, and everyone is well within their rights to continue boycotting blizzard, but it isn't like they aren't making steps in the right direction here,
How was the punishment dictated by China exactly? The punishment was dictated by Blizzard, not NetEase or China or the CCP.
You don't think this is political for china? You don't think gay marriage was a political topic? You don't think civil rights was a political issue?

Just because it is a good thing and the right thing doesn't make it magically non-political.
They didnt have to apologize in the first place. You people just want to whine and complain and never will accept any apology that blizzard has to offer because that who redditors are.
I love your use of buzz words like “empty”. You literally can’t even give me an example of something Blizz could say that would satisfy you. You don’t even know what you want and it’s hilarious. Your just spouting nonsense online because it what everyone else’s is doing and you want to fit in and be a part of something lmfao.
youre choosing to boycott the product that is the absolute easiest product to boycott, and you think your one small step makes you better than everyone else. 

it’s laughable.
So let me get this straight. To understand you and anyone who boycotts blizzard and their games.

You want blizzard to stop supporting their single largest foreign market because of how their government behaves, and your way of doing this is to...


...make their domestic market smaller ?

Well, good luck with that, homie. 

Oh and I have family in Hong Kong. You take my lack of seriousness in the posts directed at slacktivist and arm chair warriors as immature and tbh it’s simply because I find almost every redditor who e-rages on here a joke. Most of these posters are nothing but “thoughts and prayers” type of people. You’ll unsubscribe from WoW then think you’re doing your part but didnt do shit lmao but again, a company doesn’t dictate my morals or ethics. And this situation isn’t as black and white as you’re making it out to be. But if you can’t figure that out then that’s on you lmao , sheep.
Agreed. But the people here? The people in the image?
What does that have to do with it?
'if people dont protest for everything I care about at once then they aren't doing enough'
Yes, the extradition bill...as in, criminals accused of reeeeeeally bad crimes who escape Mainland China and into Hong Kong. 

Seems fair even though Hong Kong IS China and China could, if it wanted, just waltz in there to get the criminals themselves. Instead, they basically ask permission with a bill that says, "Hey, Hong Kong, if really bad people escape into Hong Kong, will you kick them out please?". 

Also, we're Chinese here...my partner, she was actually born in China and moved her when she was 14. So, yeah: we definitely know more than you do about what's going on.

Yeah, sad you won't be able to play it though! Even though we both know you'll cave and buy it eventually. You'll try to get away with playing a friends version of it, but you'll get it eventually. Even if you don't, there's two over here who will definitely be getting it. 

Oh, and we already pre-ordered Warcraft III Re-forged. Can't wait to play it in a few months.
Sure there are other games, Path Of Exile is definitely my gritty replacement for Diablo II and it's a free game, but it won't really matter since I've been in love with the Diablo Universe since I could read.
Yes. I can tell you're the superior intellect here by how well your sentence is structured.
[Citation Needed]
You’re confident is pretty misplaced then, 30 millions in sales is not off of good will. 30 million sales is because it is a successful game and was well received.
>if reaper redeemed it.

It didn't.

If you played efficiently it turned into spamming 1 or 2 buttons.

2 AT THE MOST!
you completed the story at around level 30 or so. then you had to replay it over and over again to reach max level.

once you reached max level you found out that legendary drops were rare and there was no guarantee the stats they rolled with was even relevant to your class but don't worry you could just open your wallet instead and buy perfect drops from the auction house.

on top of that hardcore players got assassinated in the blink of an eye by ghosts on certain maps and inferno was totally out of scale when it came to difficulty making it literally unfun to play.

all in all it was a total shit show and with Reaper of Souls they had fixed most of that with torment levels, cube to allow gear flexibility, ancient gear to cater to those that wanted to grind and loot 2.0 that at least guaranteed relevant stats on your drops.
Well they did overrule the punishment by a bit.
Literally the WOW Q&A summed up perfectly. The kid was screaming and interrupting and the guy was like, yea I agree.
I've already boycotted their games, deleted my account and contacted my government.

A great read 451, and a great point as well. Some other stories, and even metal gear 2 have mentioned this. Sense we have such a huge amount of info, how do we vet it, find an issue to fix based on facts, or process all of it. It's a very new issue for humanity, so we or the next generation will have to find a solution somehow. Hopefully an ethical one.
Imagine thinking people only get to stand up for or protest against something if they are totally unimpeachable themselves and have been standing for the issue their entire lives.  The notion that changing events or circumstances might inspire someone to action makes them a hypocrite, the notion that something being raised higher in the public consciousness and so people flock to support it is seen as hopping on the bandwagon.

What's really vile is people who hide behind their keyboards squealing 'no true scotsman' at the people who are actually in the street and actually standing up for what they believe in.
This should be the top comment.  Stranger I wish I could give you some gold for this but I have no moneys instead I'll wish you a good day
You’re bothered by the fact that people chose their fights? That they don’t accept your view of the world being black and white? That if they don’t live out their life in a cave, their actions are hypocritical? That’s the sentiment of every loser with a keyboard trying to justify their own inability to act.
I do not use Apple products, buy Nikes, watch Disney-produced media, and try to avoid the others when I can. You should look up "Fairphone"; A company tried to make a cellphone where no human suffering was an ingredient, and found it is literally impossible. There are parts that are *only* made in sweatshops that infrastructure to do elsewhere simply doesn't exist for, because it doesn't need to.

The practice is so ingrained into our industry it is literally impossible to completely divorce yourself from while remaining a part of the modern world. Saying that unless someone avoids all of them then they should avoid none of them is unfair at best, and ignorant at worst.
Abolitionists wore clothes that were most likely made by slaves at the time. They realized that slavery was the problem, not the clothing. You don't fight the entire war at once, you fight battles. 

Blizzard is a smaller company than the super corporations that you mentioned. They might actually listen. 

And I mean, come on. Reddit calls out every single one of the corporations you mentioned as well. Nobody is singling out Blizzard.
Not to mention: How many people that are so angry about Hong Kong are in the same group that are angry whenever someone protests police brutality in the US?
I've always hated Apple products, that flame growing starting back in 2005.

I haven't cared for Disney since I was a child. Marvel included.

I've never owned Nike anything.

Saying all this just makes me sound pompous, even if true. People are fickle.
No Apple, no Disney, Nike was on clearance. How am I doing?
Apple? No.  
Disney? No.  
Nike? No.  


About the worst thing I support with my dollars is every now and then I'll buy clothes that aren't ethically sourced because, well the premium for ethical clothing is just way too dammed high and I just outright don't have the money.
The fact that there are more companies doing it doesn't mean we can't call out Blizzard on this. You're not proving anything new.
That's how you start not caring about anything. 

* Why care about China when your electronics made there?

* Why care about BP/Shell environmental disinformation  campaign when you use their gasoline?

* Why care about blood diamond in Africa when you buy one for your engagement?

* Hell, if you are In WW2, why care about Jewish in concentration camp when you use German car and buy their Hugo Boss suit?

The matter of facts is, you NEED to be selective. Find alternative if possible. Apple bending to China? Go with Samsung which use less Chinese materials. BP use misinformation? Switch to electric car if possible or take more public transport. Nestle bent the knee? Use like a cal made product of possible.

That's how you do it, not finding excuse so you feel better about using their products!
youre just gatekeeping activism. its the same with people who get mad when someone tells them about climate change and try to throw it back in peoples faces and say 'well what are you doing? do you drive a car? do you ever buy anything made of plastic? you can't say anything!'  


no, people can speak up even if there are other things going on and even if they themselves aren't perfect
"hUrR DuRr wE LiVe In A sOcIetY hUrR dUrR"

That's how stupid you sound.
You wrote how I feel every day. I wonder this, in an unhealthy manner. I appreciate knowing im.not the only one with stuff like this on my mind. You lifted a huge weight off my shoulders.
That's the point of all of that heroic mythos, people fantasize about what they cannot do themselves.
You do not speak for everyone, and this is happening less and less more then ever now because people are realizing how things are connected.
Just cause your a callous jackass doesn't mean everyone else is.
> I don't know why any of you would give a shit. 

> .. and how that affects us.

Well there you go...
There are groups that protect other animals, plus those that don't consume meat because they don't wish to harm them, but as you say there are those that ignore animals pain too. People are complex that's why asking questions, exploring morality is a good practice.
I wasn't trying to accuse anyone of anything just share some thoughts is all. I didn't wish to offend.
It makes it difficult for them to stream the event in China
It's performative at best, is the point.
Nothing is still nothing. It's like trying to empty out the ocean one glass at a time, it's "technically something" so you can pay yourself on the back.
No. It really dosent. China doesn't care what some guy in america is wearing
tell me what it does exactly? What is this "something" that it will do?
Was it though? Most of the time they were ignored or had a passing comment, they were like any other person. No. One. Cared.
I am a Hong Konger, I think you are helping! Thank you so much!!

Anything that can let the world know about HK is helping!
> I hate this thinking.

So do I, which is why I don't think it makes any sense to shit on people that don't participate in your cause. Go and hand out as many free t-shirts as you want, but don't shit on people that don't want them.

That's not "doing something" that's "feeling superior".
[deleted]
I feel like everyone that is attending blizzcon already is aware of Hong Kong. I went there today and passed by them.

I thought about grabbing a shirt but it was too crowded when I got there this morning. 

I support Hong Kong, but I'm not gonna fight tooth and nail to let everyone know I do. There's not much more that I can do besides upvote reddit posts or take a shirt that I might wear once every few weeks.

The president apologized already, and when you have an image to uphold, you can't unequivocally go out and say things. The people that decided to ban the player probably acted out of fear but they didn't consider the brand image of Blizzard when they did it.
Helps who, exactly? 
The oppressed farmer is suddenly relieved because I laughed about a meme?  
HK is suddenly free because someone shared a picture?  
In the current time and date, awareness is important but usually somewhat "easily" achieved.  
Actions are not and I fail to see any - no one on reddit REALLY bats an eye about things that happen in Africa, China or even in their own land and country.  
America is especially guilty of this - outraged about video games, while someone with a few loose screws almost weekly walks into a school and just shoots people.  
HK is an even worse example - no entity in the worlds sets actions or consequences, hence a video game company get's lynched for not doing so.

You break into a shop. You shit on the floor. The owner comes back and asks you to stop shitting on the floor.

The owner doesn't support the govt. He just doesn't want you to shit on his floor.
Wait, what does Apple have to do with this?
So you refuse to purchase or interact with any company who supports the mistreatment of others? How about all the US companies who have ties to our own government which is responsible for some pretty disgusting things in recent history? Or is it just Blizzard specifically?
it sucks that the people that make the games get paired with the people that don't make the games, but whatareyougonnado. If the names were publicly available it'd be much easier to target them but then you'd cross the borders which you are there to defend
So why aren't people protesting at League of Legends Worlds atm?

America is the regime no?

Are you referencing the insane levels of propaganda gamers consume?
> Almost like they're there for video games, but the developer is their for money and in the middle of those 2 things recently human rights entered the crossfire. Imagine that!

Human rights never entered the crossfire, just politics. And it was foisted there by the same fools doing this.

You KNOW that blizzard is a company. Just like any other company. They have simple, easy to follow rules.

Could you stop trying to shit on the floor for 30 seconds, or is that beyond you?
> to be fair blizzard did this to themselves. expecting backlash to die down because you're mad at politics is silly

Blizzard didn't hoist a man onto the stage and force him to spout political slogans.
> Politics thrusts itself into everything. That is the nature of life.

Are you the kind of nutjob that tries to force their way into an occupied stall pretending that you have a right to do so?
Freedom of speech doesn't protect you from a private company taking away your bounty. A better word is freedom of expression in this case. He's allowed to say it but be prepared for the consequences.
You people literally have no idea what freedom of speech even means. It protects you from the government, not from private establishments which can have their own rules on what speech they allow.

If they guy was sporting a MAGA hat and directly supported Trump and they did this literally no one would complain.
That guy signed a contract saying that he agreed that his prize money would be reduced to 0dlls by engaging in an act that brings you into public disrepute or offends a portion or group of people. An adult entered into a contract, broke it and got the consequences he agreed to. (even less, cause they reduced the ban and gave him his prize money back) 

 I support Hong Kong, but just like a guy say, going into a tirade about abortion being murder would have no place in a hearthstone tournament, neither does politics, he knew it agreed to it and then did it anyway. That said I'm glad he got his money back.
That's not a freedom of speech issue. Christ. Do they not teach you idiots this in school anymore??
Since when did freedom of speech apply to a private business' own platform?
They pulled the prize pool from a guy because he broke their no politics rule, he broke their contract. Are you people insane? Or do you know understand what freedom of speech is?

Ate the onion
It was a figure of speech, you big-eared elephant.
I mean, there are videos ans news reports of molotovs and IEDs.

But it's true that it's not all protesters or could be agent provocateurs.
You’re lucky you’re not in HK where the protestors beat you up if you don’t agree with them. It doesn’t matter if you’re old, or a petite woman, everyone who doesn’t stand for “freedumb” is attacked
Yeah! Some of us want to play video games and some of us want to play video games and preserve human rights. How dare they force their disgusting human rights on me!
If all you are doing is 'informing' then you aren't protesting.
You'll never get anything done walking around on eggshells worried that other people might have a bad time.
However they feel like.

I have a problem with this reply in particular. The problem is deeper than "support blizzard = support dictatorship" let's take Chick-fil-A for example. They are known for donating to Christian organizations who support the oppression of gay people. Does eating there mean you support that oppression? Yes and no. It's an ethical question more than anything
"sure, I buy blood diamonds, but that doesn't mean I support ethnic cleansing?"
Blizzard is a company. How could they be a dictatorship? They’re just a shitty company willing to support the censorship of a brutal totalitarian state to make money. That doesn’t make them special, but it does make them unworthy of my money or support. I suggest anyone who enjoys their freedom of speech to do the same, otherwise some day you might be banned or silenced yourself.

What did they do?
a girl can dream
not giving money to corporations that have shown themselves as anti hk does, don't mean I can't find the game by other means

but if stealing really did help, I would 100% steal
Start by removing pro-Hong Kong censorship on their platforms. 

I can criticize China in McDonalds.

I can criticize China on valve.

I can criticize China on Apex. 

We HAVE a bill to help fight for Hong Kong: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/china-condemns-houses-passage-of-bill-supporting-hong-kong-democracy/2019/10/16/d513a432-efbf-11e9-bb7e-d2026ee0c199_story.html?outputType=amp

Reversing the penalty would be a good start. 

Reaffirming their “listen to every voice” policy would be a good follow up.

And as a company that brags about how “woke” it is, maybe actually make a statement of support for the people of Hong Kong but I get that’s probably never going to happen. If they could put people before profit this 1 time, it would really make me happy.
> The mob mentality seems to be that they are not willing to forgive.

I disagree. The issue is that, currently, they have not apologized for what they did, only for getting caught doing it. They are giving apologies that are meaningless because they aren't address what they actually did wrong.

> If a group of people want to hold an entire company responsible but won't accept multiple apologies and admission of wrong doing from that company, even tentatively, then I don't know what any of us are doing here.

That's the problem. They HAVEN'T apologized or admitted their wrongdoing. They made up something else, and then apologized for THAT. It's basically PR bullshit 101. Make up something that sounds related, but is not the thing people are actually angry about, and then release a PR speak apology about that, instead of apologizing for what you actually did. Then you'll have a bunch of white knights who haven't paid enough attention to what you actually said (or plain just don't care) come to defend you.
When has a single vote ever mattered? That doesn't mean you shouldn't vote.
The board of directors are judged by the level of growth they manage to achieve. A few percentage points shaved off the overall growth of the company could actually make a big difference to their remuneration and future as members of the board of directors.

You don't need anywhere near a majority to make a difference. You just need to get loud and get active.
Ok Nihilist.
You sound like BioWare dude.
TBH I think playing the games and making them spend money to keep the servers running while not spending money on anything else would be better
Ah, so you are saying we should just.let every comment live in eternal bliss that they are right and everyone thinks the same way they do? The internet is going to be a boring place, soon, if that is the trend.
Playing games I enjoy and supporting their developer? Yeah, you are right. That IS strange.
I was under the impression that google operated in China. But do you think that google is not operating in China for... ethical reasons? You think China offered a billion $ check that Google refused? I think there's another reason for it...           
           
Also, are you saying that Nike's shoes cannot be used to oppress the people but Blizzard's games can?
Regardless, riots against an authoritarian regime are inherently legitimate and justified.
It's more that it screams of 'whataboutism'.  Sure there's going to be some people supporting it that take it too far or target the wrong people or whatever, there's always going to be some in any movement that's more than a handful of people.  But compare those relatively isolated incidents with protestors disappearing, being gang-raped and/or being beaten to a pulp or people trying to organise boycotts against companies that support China compared to china completely cutting off companies that don't crack down on the slightest support of Hong Kong.
They just fell in line with the CCP, just like many other countries and corporations, and it's understandable to not be happy with that. It comes down to the CCP's censorship spreading globally, and getting censored by a foreign power doesn't sit right.

And I hope people aren't actually hating the citizens... It's not like they even know what's really going on, and if they do, I think they've realized how dangerous it would be to talk.
But your original quote was claiming that they were trying to pretend they weren’t wet

I have a bridge to sell you.

For real though, have you been living under a rock? China has influenced many American companies to take action when they throw a tantrum
LGBT topics are definitely political in some places, which makes it weird that Blizzard so openly takes a stance on it but not on this.
Ah yes, for apologists for criminals against humanity, it is "politics". How about you use that brain of yours though and realise that talking about taking away 1million + people's basic human rights to free speech, and fair trail is a slightly more pressing issue than where you believe something like tax law should be
Blizzard is an American company and human rights shouldn't be a political issue. there shouldn't have been any punishment for what was said.
Torture isn't politics
You could at least pretend to have read the comments chain before jumping into the defense of the multi million dolllar corporation you seem to think can do no wrong, because I already talked about that.
Buzz word? It wasn't a real apology, they don't intend to change anything, it doesn't get much emptier than that.

What could they say? Be frank about the situation, spell out the reasons why they do what they do. I thought it was pretty obvious with what I said on the last post.

By the way, being a blind zealot to blizzard won't a) gain you any favors with them (chances are they will never acknoweldge you exist) b) it won't motivate them to continue supporting the game you like (money is what decides what lives or dies, your non monetary support doesn't really matter to them). You might as well actually speak your mind instead of trying to pretend the problems aren't there, and that anyone who calls out those problems is "X insult".
Even if it seems hopeless I'll avoid buying from them. I don't participate in the boycott because I expect Blizzard to crumble into dust. They did something morally incorrect, and I can't support that. If everyone thought it was pointless obviously nothing would happen because they all give up. You want to call boycotters armchair protesters but what the hell do you expect me, a broke college student, to do other than not give them my money? The hope is that it gets a message across, and I think it has. It wasn't very successful because Blizzard will never admit they care more about shareholders than players. I know this is the case with most game companies but at this point they're even punishing the players. If they had just disqualified Blitzchung for bringing politics into a game I wouldn't have batted an eye, but they literally banned him for a year before bringing it down to 6 months. That's pretty severe for a couple of seconds of protest.

I never even said to pull out of China, but if dealing with China means having to be policed by the CCP then they need foresight. Also, Blizzard was founded in the USA and their headquarters are still in California. Blizzard is an American company afraid to be banned in China, and that fear overpowers Blizzards supposed values. People want to act like China didn't assert their influence when there's hundreds of examples of China controlling American corporations. From banning the Taiwan flag icon on iphones to forcing Morey to retract his statement.
Yes. Exactly. That's what I want Blizzard to do. 

Stop supporting international criminals.
the 13.4k people that did not bother to show up at the protest and let the 50-100 people down that were protesting there. The people that actually protest at blizzard at least did something, even if it was never going to be effective. At least they actually care a bit about HK and not just. I hate blizzard so I meme.
That they actually showed up no matter how few. Meanwhile all the armchair critics in here talking about a pathetic showing.
You're doing nothing.
Sorry what? You think being ethnically Chinese makes you somehow more knowledgeable on the situation than someone else who has clearly done research?

Also, the extradition bill would allow for anyone in HK to be extradited on request of the Chinese Government, and the approval of that request would be totally up to the Chinese elected CE WITHOUT a criminal trial. Not only is that a total abuse of power, but it undermines Hong Kong's independency and could be seen as the first step to a slippery slope of Chinese political intervention in HK. That's why it is being protested.

I don't understand how people like you can try and justify the actions of China's clearly tyrannical government. From the suppression of information, to the 're-education camps', the Chinese government is doing unforgivable things. Is it because of your ethnic link to the country that you feel the need to support them?
You don’t need that, just play both games and you will notice the difference immediately.
I wouldn't be so confident in a game that got outsold by Wii fit. But honestly the number of copies a game sells doesn't mean it's good. It means its catered to the lowest common denominator. Which is why a game like Wii fit outsells Diablo 3.

Your mindset matches their's though. They make money, not games. If you like that go ham, but it's a cycle that makes objectively worse games.
Lol to be fair that's what diablo 2 was.... Which I loved. However, we do expect some sort of progression as these games continue to release.
Oh I definitely know all that, but people make a big deal and say "This game was crap" when the fact was "This game's ENDGAME was crap" would be far more accurate to say. RoS fixed the endgame loops to be fun and made seasonal stuff that brought people back to the game over and over.

I enjoyed D2 and D3 but D3+RoS actually kept me coming back and playing far more than any previous iteration did.
Without revoking the statement, and stating that the punishment was justified anyway. 

Or, in laymans terms, trying to stem the rage rather than fix the mistake.
Ok good then move on. You already hit Blizzard where they hurt. What is the end game of protesting Blizzard and act like you are hong kong protestors? what is the end goal of all this? to give blizzard more publicity ? or you guys like to waste air?
I have no part in any of this either, so that's water off my back. The difference is that I keep any negative opinions to myself, as I'm not so hypocritical as to call out those who _do_ anything for what they believe in while I'm in my "safe space". On the other hand, you criticizing from behind your keyboard are risking what, exactly? Aside from making yourself look like an idiot, I mean. That ship has sailed, I'm afraid.
Where do you live?
Do you expect Americans to protest *in* China?
I think it starts with getting money out of politics, as potentially tangential as that may seem. It starts the snowball effect which with continued improvements allow us to solve this problem. Without getting money out of politics, all good potential solutions to the problem will have this as a roadblock.
The solution is focus on the problems in front of you and the people around you.  Do what you can to help yourself your neighbors your family and friends....  Im not saying ignore the other side of the world, (because we need to have a global perspective on things since we are all in some way connected) but chances are there's not much you can directly do to help everyone.  
So help and support those around you so they can help and support those around them and so on....
Ripple effect.
Be good to your neighbors people.
If you are going to call people "idiots who don't care about human rights abuses"  for not protesting blizzard. Then yeah you should probably not be doing the same shit just with different companies that are actually worse. If you want to selectively boycott thats cool, but acting high and mighty and putting others down while doing the same shit yourself with a different company is pretty stupid.
Right. That comment made me immediately think of [this](https://i.imgur.com/CDgZs2m_d.jpg)

Edit: full and better version [here. ](https://thenib.com/mister-gotcha)
What beliefs are you standing up for when your protest starts and stops with Blizzard?
> I wish I could give you some gold

A fraction of that money goes directly to China, you know that right?
I am bothered by the people who have chosen this to be their fight and absolutely shit on anyone who have chosen something else. It reminds me of militant vegans that go over the top at people who haven't chosen to give up meat.
.....The whole point is the hypocrisy in calling people 'memoryless idiots who don't care about human rights abuses" for not boycotting blizzard while there are many companies much more direclty involved in human rights abuses that these redditorrs are not boycotting. Yeah you can call out Blizzard selectively that is fne, but your a hypocrit if your going to insult people for supporting a company for one reason and then turn around and support companies that are much worse in that same reason.
I do not speak for everyone. I said "most people". By no account does that mean everyone, nor does that mean that I speak for them.

If you would, could you clarify what is happening less and less?
[deleted]
I'm just saying exactly what caused all those people to ignore the protesters as they passed them.

Do you disagree? Do you not think that was the case? Do you think they actually "cared" when they ignored them?
ok bud lol go stop the insects from eating each other lol
Not sure how considering they are outside and 99.9% of it takes place inside.
So a joke, because performances usually are done for entertainment.
People nowadays especially Americans imho engage in shallow forms of activism often fueled by outrage coming from the MSM which often takes the form of virtue signaling and exhibiting a false sense of moral superiority
Except I’m not doing that, the guy above me said that handing out shirts is “useless”, and I was saying that raising awareness / making sure the news isn’t forgotten IS a good thing to do. Nowhere am I shitting on people that don’t participate. 

In fact I’d say the people shitting on the protestors saying “they’re not making a difference”, “why bother” are the ones that are playing the cynical part to feel superior.
>I don't know anyone

Which is very limited... if even just one person sees the tshirt who was not aware before and is now, it's a win.
I am a student of International Relations. I have had to explain the HK situation FROM SCRATCH to several people in the same programme: People who expressed interest in the topic, and would certainly seek answers... all it took was a real and proper mention for them to ask 'wait what's going on?'.

People need to know. And this is how they get to know.
You'd be surprised how much of the General Audience remain unaware, deliberately or otherwise.

And raising awareness is useful. Otherwise this controversy wouldn't have reached the ear of the US Senate. Don't try to diminish the small acts we do to help the larger picture. Only dictatorial tyrants and their lackeys shout down awareness raising (while on the other hand censoring media - why do that if awareness raising is useless?).
>but I wanna do memes!
I don't know anyone who isn't aware of Coca-Cola, yet those morons keep wasting millions or useless advertisement. You should contact them and tell them that, they might give you some reward!
bitch this isnt the Susan G breast cancer awareness campaign. Most people certainly do not know what is going on in Hong Kong. Yes on reddit it is fairly popular but the average joe is not aware.
yeah but are you AWARE of breast cancer yet?
Cool. Like what?
Yes, tell the person living in Hong Kong what is and isn't helpful to their cause.
Now educate them. All my friends know about the crisis in HK as well, but very few of them actually knew why it happened, how it happened and what's going on, until I told them.
"Raising awareness at this point is useless" - As if upvoting news takes soooo much work from you. 

It's a matter of making sure the issue doesn't get forgotten while HK is still fighting. It's literally the least we can do. "Do something useful"? If you want to do more, feel free to donate against China's shitty regime.
Even if people know, it's to make sure HK isn't forgotten by the media/people. The struggle in HK is still ongoing. 

Nobody's asking you to fight tooth and nail. I literally listed the things that you can do to help as, "sharing pictures, memes, news articles". 

The point is, we want to keep HK in the news long enough that it becomes a bigger point of discussion in America, and puts more pressure on China to give up trying to take over HK. Or at the very least have enough of a spotlight on HK that China can't pull some *extremely* atrocious things to try to take over.
I've been playing for 15 years. It adds up.
It’s 15 year old game, that shit adds up. Who are you to judge these guys? You’re on a gaming subreddit you damn nerd.
Except people will be arrested, or even killed in places, for exposing their boobs.  They're highly political.
Wait till you find out about Brest feeding and the frenzy that causes.
Rapists?
[removed]
Noooo.

It's just a fact of life.

Politics have become so broad and all encompassing that everything you do is now a political statement.

It's stupid but that's how shit works now.

Political views and opinions are basically synonymous. Everyone has them, everyone shows them constantly, and most of them are terrible.
Except blizzard specifically apologized to the Chinese people.
I'm sorry is the lesson here "human rights are poop?"
Weird analogy.

Wait I thought the guy broke into the store . . . But the owner is actually there?

So why did he B&E if the place is open? Like he coulda walked through the front door but just didn't because reasons?

&#x200B;

>The owner doesn't support the govt. He just doesn't want you to shit on his floor.

&#x200B;

Yeah but what if the owner doesn't actually care one way or another if you shit on his floor, but if he supports the government position on floor-shitting he might make some more money from customers who don't like floor shitting, but also might alienate all those customers that do like floor shitting, like me!

&#x200B;

This isn't an analogy anymore, I actually really like floor-shitting.

&#x200B;

It's liberating.
Every bit helps. Every journey starts with a single step.
It's a binary choice; China is actively suppressing the autonomy and freedom of the people of Hong Kong. If you don't side with Hong Kong in this matter, then you are complicit in China's actions.
no, but they put a man who they hoisted on stage on full blast because he did say something political
This is what it sounds like when life hands you everything, to the point you can just sit on your lazy ass doing nothing good for the world and act like it's a virtue to not care.

By taking this lazy ideology, all you're doing is showing support for the status quo, whether you want to or not this is what siding with China, and any authoritarian in power looks like.

So do us a favor and either take some kind of stance on something like an adult, or learn to keep to your trap shut while the grown ups are talking.
That wasn't the point. The point is that all that we do has political connotations, from what we eat, what we wear, what entertainment we consume, etc.
Are you the kind of nutjob who doesn't actually have a point and just says random shit when his obtuseness is called out?
The crux of the matter is that China is able to use it's gigantic market and influence to indirectly stifle opposing voices in other countries. That's definitely a freedom of speech issue. Blizzard isn't the first, but is one of the most visible corporations to kowtow to China to stay on their good side, so it makes sense they are being protested.

Edit: Besides, freedom of speech and freedom of expression the same in almost every aspect. See the Oxford Dictionary definition of freedom of speech: "the right to express any opinions without censorship or restraint."
Yes, the consequences of a company who supports human rights abuses.

Like harvesting organs.
No one is calling for laws to be applied.  They're not trying to take Blizzard to court.

Seems like you're the only one with this misunderstanding about freedom of speech.  

We are all endowed with certain inalienable rights, whether they're listed in the Constitution or not.
Since when did ANY rights apply to a business platform?
They get away with it due to a loophole regarding freedom of expression. [See this episode of "The Patriot Act" with Hasan Minhaj.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5CQ5-NMzG8s)
So I guess the colonists should have never dumped a private companys tea in the water...

Blizzard pulled the prize money I support of a government that does not allow freedom of speech. It is conpletely fair to say that boycotting blizzard is in support of freedom of speech.
human right num. 19. **Freedom of Expression.** We all have the right to make up our own minds, to think what we like, to say what we think, and to share our ideas with other people.

aaand num 18. **Freedom of Thought.** We all have the right to believe in what we want to believe, to have a religion, or to change it if we want. (for good measure)
Not here to argue about blizzards ethics, but according to the UN, free speech is indeed one of thirty human rights.
Free speech is absolutely a human fundamental right. However it's mostly protected from the government not a private company.
Then what is a human right?? The right to free speech in America is called the first amendment. 

Obviously they're a private company, but then why bother bringing rights up at all?
What? Natural rights are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Liberty is by definition, "the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views". Sounds a lot like freedom of speech is a human right bud.
I just know you hide behind outrage and don't do anything to change anything. Its easier to incite more outrage than incite change
Can you be more explicit? What is the way you feel like?
I see. Interesting.

Why don't you do that yourself rather than instigating others?
I'm bisexual and despite their delicious chicken I have not spent money at chick fil a for years because they fund anti lgbtq activism. I think it's pretty black and white. I've probably spent about 4 years of my life playing various diablo games daily (especially diablo 2, to a lesser extent 1, 3 was not too great) I was there paying for the expansion pack on diablo 2 the day it came out back in the day, but I will not be giving money to Blizzard anymore.
I mean, it at least means that you won’t let something small like “the oppression of other people” inconvenience you.
Tell me what company you buy your products from, Ill get back to you to tell you how many genocides you support.
People are there to have an enjoyable weekend away, messing with their enjoyment is gonna make them hate HK's cause more.

The crunch to get Witcher 3 out was pretty ridiculous and employees were basically forced to work day and night, 7 days a week, and no holidays or vacation to get it done. All while they skirted around some loose labor laws and paid their employees shit when compared to a US developer, which already isn't that well paying. They even admitted it was not humane after being lambasted about it in on employee/employer sites such as Glassdoor.
You can critise china on Battle.net.

I doubt you can do so on an official broadcast event by McDonalds, Valve or EA. People have been Critising China on Battle.net, people are running around with names like "FreeHongKong" and nothing is happening.

These sorts of bills are bunk and mean nothing. Most of the world "condemned" Russia for invading another country, but no one actually did anything to combat it.

The world is a pretty shitty place, besides what's going on in Hong Kong, there's also the chinese concentration Caps, North Korea, Chile, Venezuela and too many more to list.

When I come home, I might decide to chill out and watch a stream of a game I like, or the newest upload of some youtuber I like. I know what's going on in Hong Kong, I support the people there, but if I turn on a stream for Hearthstone, I'd like it to be about Hearthstone.

Do you really want every single media you watch, TV Shows, gaming tournaments etc to all involve a segment where one of the people does a message about their cause? How would you feel about a Chinese player coming on and doing a segment about how they support China and that it's not doing anything wrong? how about a Russian talking about the annexing of Crimea and how it's what the people wanted, or a North Korea getting to speak his piece about how great his country is?

There's a right place for all these things, everyone has a right to an opinion. an eSport gaming tournament live-stream is not that place.
>I disagree. The issue is that, currently, they have not apologized for what they did, only for getting caught doing it. They are giving apologies that are meaningless because they aren't address what they actually did wrong.

What is it that you feel was not addressed specifically enough?

Per [https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23185888/regarding-last-weekend-s-hearthstone-grandmasters-tournament](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23185888/regarding-last-weekend-s-hearthstone-grandmasters-tournament)
>I want to take a few minutes to talk to all of you about the Hearthstone Grandmasters tournament this past weekend. On Monday, we made the decision to take action against a player named blitzchung and two shoutcasters after the player shared his views on what’s happening in Hong Kong on our official broadcast channel.

This is them prefacing what they're talking about.

>We’ve had a chance to pause, to listen to our community, and to reflect on what we could have done better. In hindsight, our process wasn’t adequate, and we reacted too quickly.

Fair enough, this isn't an apology. But it is acknowledgement that they reacted too quickly and too harshly. But you and I both know what that entire post was addressing. 

Per you
>Make up something that sounds related, but is not the thing people are actually angry about, and then release a PR speak apology about that, instead of apologizing for what you actually did.

What else unrelated could they possibly be referencing here? I understand how PR speak works and I know that the initial response to the backlash was was clearly executed in a very specific way. Virtually no publicly traded company in the world would have it any other way if they had a choice. They have shareholders and lawyers to answer to. 

That said, today *did* provide a more formal apology from JAB. 
>...We moved too quickly in our decision-making. And then, to make matters worse, we were too slow to talk with all of you.

>...And for that, I am sorry, and accept accountability.

This isn't a parent-child relationship. You're not going to get something akin to  "I'm sorry for taking your lipstick and dipping it in the toilet." They're going to be more general about it, but everyone knows exactly what they're talking about.
Lmao okay bud. I just find it funny that you think Blizzard is going to miss that "shit load" of your parents' money and it's going to effect them. The money you spent, and are now refusing to spend supposedly, is less than a drop in the bucket. But sure call me a Nihilist.
Thanks...?
No, getting so angry that others might not support said developer is strange. Play your games. Other people have real world shit to deal with.
Google surrendered 30% market share in the Chinese search business because they didn't want to be involved in the Chinese censorship complex.

https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/new-approach-to-china-update.html

Both Nike and Blizzard can sell their products in China without ethical problems as long as they don't actively assist in suppressing the voices of the people of China. If Blizzard merely sold games to China and allowed people from Hong Kong to voice themselves (in the same way as other minorities) then that'd be 100% okay and ethical.
[deleted]
It might be because i'm from Australia and we have a large Chinese population and Aussies can be pretty racist, so i notice it more often the racism towards just average citizens. Many of them seem nice enough, a bit clueless about China but that is 100% not their fault.
no, being wet is acknowledging that there is a problem   
the problem that they gained a lot of hate.   
The rain is what caused the problem.        
"The world has a problem and we should change that" is just as broad as a statement as Blizz's
Then don't sign the agreement. :) Not a difficult concept.
Is your timeline on this messed up? They gave him the punishment right away...it’s not like they gave him a slap on the wrist and then China threw a tantrum and then they banned him and took his winnings. I don’t agree with what they did but don’t distort the facts.
They are allowed to take a stance, because they can craft the messaging, plan for things, and frame the discussion. What they don't want is for political topics to be brought up randomly by participants in their events, because then they may need to run damage control and appease the parties that may be offended. It is their choice to offend people that are anti LGBT, it isn't Blitzchungs decision to bring political matters into a Blizzard event (well, it is, but only with the understanding it could lead to punishment).
Where is this magic list of things excluded from politics defined? I'm clearly out of the loop here. These are things that shouldn't be politics, but stating 'X isn't politics' isn't a meaningful statement.
Except America partakes in torture but I wonder what you’ve done to stop that
you literally just told someone with family in Hong Kong that they don’t support Hong Kong because of the video game they play. this reddit comment brigade is ridiculous
50-100 is SUPER generous.
No one’s saying they didn’t show up, they’re saying it was pathetically small and kind of funny. 

It was like 10 people milling around the outside of the center. No one cared. 

Your responses don’t make sense to what you’re responding to.
So what are you doing besides trolling people who are doing something?
but i downvoted the bad game company on reddit! i stand with hong kong
I have. The player numbers on PoE are tiny compared to D3 and it’s already f2p. It’s not anywhere near as popular as Poe fans would like to believe.
So being;

1 critically acclaimed

2 massively popular

3 one of the best selling games of all time


means nothing because of your opinion? That might be the most reddit thing I’ve ever heard
Never played 2 :0

I just remember becoming bored with throwing up on people as the witch doctor... Because that's all I ever had to do.
Slam. Dunk.
I think you've misunderstood me.

I was saying that the people which are done with Blizzard have already deleted their accounts, stopped buying games/merch from Blizzard, maybe even contacted their representatives/government about HK. I also said that these people don't have time and money to join a protest outside a glorified advertisement, and shouldn't have to go through a bunch of hoops to prove that they protest and are done with Blizzard.
Right but we need to do more then just help those closest to us, we need to build better communities and show the world we can work together and come to agreements and make our own world.
This was my general point. I honestly don’t care if you hold Blizzard in contempt because you’re right for multiple reasons, but when you start saying that that is the bar for caring about human rights, you’re being obtuse and presumptuous of people’s efforts to change elsewhere.
The caricature of a protestor you've built in your head is very detailed, or has this happened to you at one of the many protests you've attended?
https://thenib.com/mister-gotcha
Why don't you ask them?
[deleted]
But how can you even know it is most people? There is no real evidence of that, there are tons of people in the world.
I have donated money to several groups supporting the protests, I've wrote emails to my representatives in both the house and Senate and I've chosen not to spend any money or to support blizzard in anyway I can. I do care and I've done what I can to support what I believe in. You may not believe that but that's okay, at the end of the day I've done what I can to help and that's enough for me.
No you're generalizing and projecting your own opinions.
Which was generally my point, I don't care if you want to hand out t-shirts, I don't care if you want to wear a t-shirt support a cause, but don't shit on people for not taking your t-shirts because t-shirts don't actually accomplish anything.
> the guy above me said that handing out shirts is “useless”

No it really doesn't. Stop interjecting politics into random shit.
Sure, "everything is political." That doesn't mean people want to live and breathe politics every minute of every day. People often play video games to *escape.* Going to Blizzcon is double escape because it's vacation *and* video games. By injecting politics into it, you're taking people away from their vacation. People don't like that. Whether they agree with the message or not, it's understandable that people don't want to see stuff like this on their vacation.


If you want to spread the human rights abuses message where it might make a difference, head over to /r/LateStageCapitalism where there's half a million communists that need to be reminded that communism is what the people of Hong Kong are fighting against.
way to bend reality however you want it. Nice job!

Blizzard didn't hoist a man onto the stage and force him to spout political slogans.
​
I disagree. Blizzard didn't side with China by *not* siding with Hong Kong. Blizzard sided with China by giving out excessive punishments to people who didn't deserve them, and standing by the Chinese government in the suppression of the Hong Kong message. Blizzard makes political statements when they use the LGBT community as a vehicle for distraction and free press, but the death of democracy in a country is off limits? It's easy to see a double standard there -- it's fine if the political statement makes us money, but as soon as it toes the line of what China deems acceptable we'll start doling out punishments.

I don't think that the NBA has handled the China situation perfectly, but at least the commissioner had the balls to stand up for freedom of speech despite the massive risks to their profit. That's how Blizzard SHOULD have handled this situation. "Blitzchung's statements do not represent Blizzard because Blizzard is not a political organization."
> no, but they put a man who they hoisted on stage on full blast because he did say something political

He knew what he signed up for.
nooooo, dont twist now

the *casters* hoisted them on stage and encouraged him to spout political stuff

the *casters* and *talent* both signed contracts that state that their topics of choice for conversation should not include anything political
This is what it sounds like when life hands you everything, to the point you can just sit on your lazy ass doing nothing good for the world and act like it's a virtue to post about how much you hate video game companies on reddit.
> That wasn't the point. The point is that all that we do has political connotations, from what we eat, what we wear, what entertainment we consume, etc.

No it really doesn't. Stop interjecting politics into random shit.
> Are you the kind of nutjob who doesn't actually have a point and just says random shit when his obtuseness is called out?

Interjecting politics randomly into everything is pretty invasive, I thought you would understand it if I made a comparison most people have encountered.

You HAVE used a restroom before, right? You understand it locks for a reason?
No one's defending blizzard in the thread just the outcome of using your freedom of speech. Free speech allows me to go on public land and scream I hate all "insert group of people" and not get anything done to them by the government. But that means certain private corps like Google has deny me service. 

Yeah I know one example is someone being a racist and someone fighting for people's rights but they still both fall under usage of free speech
look up freedom of speech in your constitution kek
Ah, insane. That explains it
You just proved my point again. Bad parents.
I'm not protesting.

I’m not bi but I believe other people should have rights no matter what their sexual orientation is. No sandwich is good enough for me to compromise on that.
Why wait? You can start doing the research and sharing it now. Would love to know if there are companies doing unethical things - also open to hearing about companies who do good things. You seem super passionate about it so get to work!
Good old "whataboutism" in full force from the pro-China troll.
Sorry about your feelings
"People are dying!" "Yeah, but what about overwatch?"
I bought my phone before the app got removed. Why should I conform to a purity test? Every effort helps - climate change is bad but I still drive my car. I do good when I can and choosing to not support a video game developer is about as low effort as it gets. Same goes for not watching the NBA. I’ll do what I can, when I can and that’s all that matters. It doesn’t have to be “all or nothing”. Honestly, no one NEEDS to play this game.
And everyone here is already aware. It's nothing but preaching to the choir. Endless talk on the internet isn't helping. They need resources.
Jesus Christ you need to look in their mirror, kid. You did everything you accused me of. You started with personal attacks. I'm merely saying that the protests at Blizzcon are misguided. Use the time, energy and resources to directly support those protesting in Hong Kong. They need food, financial support, first aid supplies, masks, goggles, funds for medical care etc. They don't need memes.
Can’t get me. I punched a Chinese cop in the face yesterday so
You did it first

Edit: nice lol he listened
The difference being Poland isn’t a totalitarian state - there’s no government pressure to silence the people talking about it. No one is being arrested or beaten in the streets because of this issue. It’s something they’ve admitted and have addressed with C2077, and it’s great people are talking about it but again - no where near the level of “helping censor the discussion of human rights violations” so good to mention and for everyone to know but not even nearly the same thing.
Well, you’re lucky you have the freedom to chose and ignore whatever you want. You’re lucky you have the freedom to have this conversation. If you don’t give enough of a shit to make a small concession in your daily comfort, then that’s your right to do it. Meanwhile, I’m going to make every effort to get the word out. If McDonald’s decides to fire some employee for supporting Hong Kong, I’ll continue to not eat their shitty food. Look dude, I’m a gamer, it’s where I spend my money on hobbies - I’ve been gaming since 1990, and it’s the easiest and most lucrative influence I can make on an issue which is why this one resonates with me and many others. I’ve enjoyed and own many blizzard games, and I want them to know what their allegiance to totalitarian China is going to cost them. That’s all it is.
... whatever man. If you can't see how much of a non-apology about that is, especially in light of the fact that they are still doing the thing you claim they are apologizing for, then your head is stuck so far into the sand that an entire excavation company wouldn't be able to dig you out.
Overwatch, Diablo 4, WOW and hearthstone are all franchises I’ve played and spent a ton on and these games were ones would have gladly tossed hundreds of dollars into on the base game, Dlc and microtransactions. I’m an adult with a ton of disposable income and this is my main hobby. That money will now go elsewhere.

And you are a nihilist, you don’t care about anything and are annoyed by people who do. It’s a pathetic existence, a waste of humanity and a major contribution to what is wrong with this country. I can tell you think it’s edgy and cool not to care, to just want to play video games but off your shitstained couch and outside your dingy shack there’s a world of people out there who need help. They’re suffering and being censored. And sure there’s more suffering than any 1 of us can fix, but the good news is that you can make an impact just by not playing these games until Blizzard admits their mistake and stops censoring players. It’s so moronically easy - all you have to do is play any number of other games that are probably better. Sure lots of companies have their weak spots but this one is public and it’s happening now and there’s a movement to do something about it, so come show your support and maybe we can make a small but meaningful difference. First blizzard, then the nba, then, I dunno, apple?, then who knows who’s next - but it would be pretty cool to see it happen.
Ok Nihilist.
How’d that work out for them?
Civil rights are being violated and Hong Kong is being encroached upon, and you're concerned about property? Lol

Some things are more important than property. The Chinese government is doing several orders of magnitude more harm than the protestors.
Don't pander to a murderous authoritarian government :) Not a difficult concept.
Uh.... You dont get a pass for putting immoral shit in your TOS just because some people are required to sign it to make money from their job. 

Just because someone needs to sign to make their money doesnt make the contract magically clean and clear
I think you are the one confused, I am not distorting anything. They didn’t ban him on the spot, it happened after the tournament ended. Ie: China threw their tantrum after it happened and before he was banned; hence, the net ease post happening at the exact time he was banned.
Listen buddy, i hate to break it to you but all of these things these companies are doing are purely business decisions. It's about the money, and the money > morals and values and integrity. The LGBT stuff was exactly the same thing. Blizzard is not alone in this at all either.

I'm not taking a stance here, i'm just stating the facts. When it comes down to it, money trumps values every single time, and if you look at world history you can see that pattern again and again. 

Values seem to be just an opiate for the masses that they pretend to hold to keep them from rising up and disrupting the system that makes them wealthy.
While any issue can be political one, the case against torture and murder is settled. There's no reason to refer to human rights as political issues because they shouldn't need discussion: they're human rights.
It doesn't matter what I have or haven't done. The argument that human rights are not politics still stands. The free world has settled that particular political issue.
Your comment implies that either you are okay with torture, or you think the average american has a path to prevent torture that they can but arent taking. 

So assuming you arent literally evil, what do you expect the average american do aside from attempting to vote in politicians who are anti torture?
It's incredible how you read all that and came to that conclusion. I'm Cuban, my country also spews that bullshit communist stuff. If my favorite Cuban musician said he loved Castro or Raul I'd stop listening in a heartbeat. And it has happened before. You make it seem like it's just Blizzard bending the knee, but it's a ton of companies like Amazon, Apple, the NBA, ect. How long does this go on until we say enough? When China controls all gaming? The top game right now, which is Fortnite, is practically owned by Tencent. Tencent runs a ton of online services that censor a lot and gather data for the CCP. The point of the boycott isn't just about Blizzard, but China's influence as a whole.

Also just because he has family in China doesn't mean I'm not allowed to talk about an issue also affecting North America.
I like being kind.
I never claimed to be doing anything in the first place.  You sure are some self righteous dorks.
Then you’re lying, because PoE has a more active playerbase, a more active forum, a more active sub, higher stream viewer counts and a lot more content for each league compared to D3’s seasons.
You are redirecting. I just made a point about how wii fit has sold 50% more copies than D3 to illustrate that copies sold are not a great gauge.

The playerbase died quite quickly, so I wouldn't talk about it being critically acclaimed. Also if you're talking about critic praise, they'll praise just about any triple AAA title that pays them.

The community was very unhappy with a lot of the design choices. So they left. Why do they not publish player populations? Because it would hurt their numbers.

D3 is not the rock to die on my friend. If you enjoyed it good for you. But the player population over time got incredibly bad except on SEA servers.
No we are mocking at people who making this protest as wasting their time. Literally this entire protest mean so little it accomplish nothing. 25k dollars wasted to yell at air. Not only Blizzard wont even be able to take action, many people already move on with their newest release. 

We are not mocking their committment but their action. They are proving again this entire thing stop being about hong kong more about bandwagon. 

Hell this exact same protest post event got deleted on r/Hongkong
Someone literally said that in this comment chain.......
I'm asking you, you seem to have pretty strong opinions about it.
People can protest Hong Kong however they want and I fully support that. What China is trying to do there is terrible. If you want to burn all your Blizzard merch and delete all their games as your way of supporting them, that's fine.

But don't be the smoker who has given it up and suddenly gets in everyone elses faces about how terrible of a human they are because they smoke. Not everyone is going to choose to die on the same hill.

That's all i'm saying. Other people aren't the literal incarnation of the devil just because they keep playing WoW or Overwatch. Maybe they have chosen to boycott apple or tossed out their Nike's or dropped support of any number of the hundreds of companies that actively do business in China.
One only needs to look at the world today. Of the billions, how many are willing to stand by their values, when called to stand with others who are seeking those same values? Of the billions, how many are willing take action? And of the billions, how many are wiling to give up something they love, if it means to stand by their values or to help others obtain theirs? 

By no means, do I say that no ones exists that follows the above questions. Only that few do, when compared to the billions who exists. Take a look at recent events, how many took action to oppose organizations who are willing support or overlook injustice for the sake of profit? Where those that decided to take action, enough to sway the organizations path? Was there enough people, to sway the organizations path?

Yet we see still, organizations continuing on their path, shaken but steady. Of all the recent events, of all the organizations, how many have changed their course because people said "no"?
To be fair, if most people just ignored them then that’s a pretty strong case to his point.

You're currently supporting China thru Reddit lmfao did you forget about Tencent or did you ignore it?
Studies show most people don’t. Over half of Americans are ignorant of their political system left alone another country’s political system.
> Wearing a T-shirt to a video game conference doesn't do anything about humans rights abuses

> handing out shirts is “useless”

They seem pretty close to me. I'll edit "hand out" to "wear" if you want.
Oh I am totally pro hardline action, and agree to that point, but if you are out of reach of "action" doing something for awareness is entirely viable and helpful.
>communism is what the people of Hong Kong are fighting against.

There it is, the dumbest take I've seen today.
https://i.redd.it/3innty5cmjr31.jpg
Ah yes, “please don’t allow the Chinese government to extradite me and my fellow citizens to concentration camps” is a renegade political statement.

Jesus, I knew people would start defending Blizzard’s actions eventually, but I didn’t think it would happen this soon.
Diets are political, some animals/plants are illegal to eat. Wearing different brands is political, companies use slave labor to make cheap goods. Entertainment is extremely political inherently as it injects the opinions of the creators.
What we eat and wear impacts the environment. What we eat and wear can support certain types of exploitation of workers.

Do you just want to ignore reports about people killing themselves over working conditions? Including those making our Iphones? The ostrich approach of sticking our head in the sand and pretending all is fine is less than truthful. We can and should do better - starting by acknowledging these problems, and doing a very small minimum action.
Denial is not just a river in egypt, it turns out
Well it does in a lot of ways but not that directly. For example creating trash we can't recycle will create long term evironmental problems, and buying all our clothes and toys from china just supports their poor working conditions and wages. most things in general don't have to be political but most people choose to not think about the things they're contributing to because its normal for them.
It really does, though. Just because you’re either willfully or hopelessly ignorant of it doesn’t make it true.
So you are that kind of person.
If he signed a contract there is no freedom.
Ah, incapable of rational argument, that explains it.
So what are some of the examples of disruption that you think is good?
of course youre not, dont wanna actually get any reprecussions for what you try and get people to do ay
You need help
I can already tell you that if you own a phone, you essentially support slavery. But I wanted to hear about you specifically, because you 100% seem like a hypocritical slacktivist on his high horse.
Yes they do, but people who already bought their tickets and also choose to protest in some way inside the event are raising awareness in a place where they are not supposed to.

You can’t expect people to hand over money that they can’t get back in the first place.
Punishing a player for using the company's platform to push a world view vs treating employees like shit to get their product out. Yep, they really aren't the same thing. One is much worse but it isn't the hip reddit circlejerk right now so keep on with your Blizz hate. I'm sure they'll shed a whole lot of tears over your dumbass.
Lmao you are hilarious. I'll repeat what I said at very beginning. Get a hold of yourself bud.

Adult with ton of disposable income? Doubt it.

I don't care about anything and live in a dingy shack? You have no clue about my life but keep reaching.
Annual revenue is estimated to be around a billion dollars so id say pretty damn good

How is it immoral to require players to stay focused on the game? Would you have found it immoral if they punished a holocaust denier or a white supremacist for using Blizzard’s broadcasts to spread their views? Just because the view which was expressed was one that you and I agree with doesn’t mean players should be free to bring whatever political agenda they want into a game. Kibbler’s post on this whole thing was the best one I’ve seen so far - Blitzchung was brave to do what he did but he did violate his contract, and Blizzard was right for punishing him but the original punishment was disproportionately harsh.
Just as there's no proof that China didn't have any involvement with the decision, there's also no proof  that they did.

Blizzard can't take a stance on this issue as a company unless it's voted on. And I bet after having a few people decide to ban Blitzchung without considering the brand image, they are even more afraid to support it because it may damage their image even more.

Think about it this way. The gay pride thing that was referenced a while ago was less of a controversial political issue than HK. It didn't really involve governments and it was pretty widely accepted. Not to mention, it wasn't thrown out randomly at the end of an event.

Think about it this way. What if someone at the end of the Overwatch Cup said, "Trump 2020!"

Based on their rules, they would be banned? Yeah. Would people care? Probably not because most people hate Trump and the topic isn't as controversial as HK.
The tournament was already over when he was doing the interview lmao. And of course they didn’t do it on the spot, I never said they did.
I'm not sure what this is in response to, I never said it wasn't about money, and I never said anything about them having good values. I was making points about terms of service, Blizzards right to have a say in the way that their events are run, and the fact that they have been attempting to take steps in the right direction without fully giving in and opening the door for political speeches after every win.
But this is still political for China. Does China just not count? I know that the preferred answer on Reddit is for all of these companies to pull out of China and stop doing business with those billion people, but that isn't always a tenable answer.
It just seems a bit silly making all this effort for a country hundreds of miles away but not bothering about some of these domestic issues which have been going on for centuries
My comment was in response to your gatekeeping who is and who is not for Hong Kong. You told *him* specifically he can't say he supports Hong Kong based on the video game he plays. His family does not matter. It is the game he plays.

Are you trying to now say he also can't support HK it if he likes Amazon, Apple, and the NBA?
So you're not doing shit, and mocking others for doing anything. Got it. Listen, narcissist-just because something may not be a problem to you doesn't mean it's not a problem. Get over yourself. You're not that important. You don't get to whine and dictate what other folks care about. If you truly don't care, try shutting up.
30 million copies sold vs a redditors feelings. Big thonkers
Then I'm not talking about you, and then you made both of us waste our time arguing.
Yes, a portion of that crowd is probably ignoring them but another part of that crowd is more then likely uninformed about the situation. whether or not they end up finding more information on the subject is entirely up to them but never attribute to maliciousness what is more than likely  just plain ignorance.
That is very much a hotly debated opinion that deals with the basics of human nature. I'm not really super informed on the subject outside of basic psychology and sociology classes I took. The little i do know though says it's far from a settled opinion or fact.
???? What does that have to do with the situation at hand? Yes Tencent does own a share of Reddit, but that doesn't mean I support them or their actions. I pay no money to use Reddit and it's not like me being on this website will fill their coffers. I don't even give them ad revenue because I use a third party app to access it. The most they get from me is another tick up on their traffic count.
*jumps to conclusions*
It seems like you are too dense to follow my point, have a nice day.
I disagree.

Non-action is what people do when they have no intention of actually helping. 

I will ask you this; can you name something feasible that could be done by average folks to help those in HK?
What are they fighting against if not the oppression of Communist China?

Not what he said.

I'm not sure if this is a difficult concept for you or you are just hugely ignorant.

I am a person that has used a restroom before, yes. Most people have.

I'm sorry to hear that you've lived a sheltered, ignorant life. Go learn some things about the world and come back.
Do what myself then?
Oh man, this is a big brain take. I wouldn’t call it slackitivism if I’m a gamer and I’m actually boycotting something I would otherwise play. That’s actually making an impact. I’ve been a very active player of overwatch, Diablo 2 & 3, hearthstone and wow, and now I’m not going to play them anymore and I’m spreading the word. Make whatever judgement you want but I know that the few hundreds of dollars I would be spending on these games, Dlc and micro transactions will now go to other games and developers. I’ll take my hobby elsewhere and recommend that others do too. Too many great games out there right now to throw my money toward supporting this bs.
And yet blizzard still gets paid. They don't care. They get the ticket sale either way
Game companies have caves to pressure from their fans in the past and they’ll do it again. I hope this is one of those times and until it is, I‘ll just play the dozens of other awesome games out there.
But I nailed your shit stained couch! You made my point for me. You don’t know much about me either so the ad hominem attacks are pointless. 

You are a nihilist though and it’s sad. Imagine thinking that caring about the suffering of people who want to live free from authoritarianism aren’t even worth OTHER people’s attention... you must think pretty little of yourself if you think other people in this situation shouldn’t be shown support on an online discussion forum.

With all the documented cases of police brutality, why are you going so far out of your way to convince people that some of the protestors might also be bad people?
The "dont talk about politics" is a lie, dude. They actively discuss and even promote political topics. 

Or did you forget that they did the whole corporate pride dance only a handful of months ago? 

LGBT people and topics are banned in tons of countries bilzz operates in. Why was that political movement considered kosher, if they have a written contract forbidding employees, players, and associates from discussing politics of any kind? 

Its cause they pick and choose when the rules matter, like when chinese censors threaten action for an anti state message is promoted. 

Its not about following the rules. Blizz already broke them.
I love that comparison. I would bet all the money I have that if someone said “trump 2020” the ban would not have been this severe.
Right that would be the only scenario where your response is relevant.
And what, praytell, are these "steps" that they are taking, and what makes you think these "steps" are even close to the right direction. Because I've seen absolutely nothing, except two really shitty and obviously insincere apologies. Words, nothing more.
30 million copies that leaves the entire dev team with a skeleton crew that can’t create any real contents for 5 years.

Listen, I’m not here to convince you, you can keep living under the rock and thinking that D3 is the most popular arpg in the market, I’m fine with that. I have met enough blizzard apologists that I know when is it the time to stop the conversation. 

Have a good day.
You are talking about the replier who complain about protest being pathetic. I am just showing that you are missing the point.
Fair point, but consider this. The people that go to conventions are generally the most invested in the hobby/interest of the convention. I find it hard to believe that the people that would go out of their way to get there wouldn’t be aware of such a huge issue with the company.

Invade China with our military and install our own democracy.
Put pressure on their government to support hk. If the world stands behind them China is more likely to back down.
>can you name something feasible that could be done by average folks to help those in HK?

Keeping the awareness for the happening alive with constantly pushing it into attention thus news media see it as a relevant topic to repeatedly make money from reporting about it as it remains in public interest. Which in turn will slowly make it more and more relevant as a national political topic and respective governments will follow with action.

&nbsp;

What would you suggest as alternative for those who can't take any action as there is no option available?
Yeah, asking people to stop spreading awareness about Hong Kong and preaching how useless it is. Oh wait that’s what YOU are doing, why are you so invested in stopping the spread of awareness?
China isn’t communist
If someone posts something on behalf of your studio, and you not denying that - it's obviously that you supporting the statement.

Willfully ignoring political issues so you can enjoy a video game sounds a lot more ignorant than whatever you just tried to accuse me of.

By defending Blizzard’s actions, you are telling the people of Hong Kong that you don’t want their suffering to get in the way of your good time.
If I fight back against someone trying to kill me, are you going to tell me not to because fighting back is associated with bloodshed?  Is bending over for every oppressive regime the way to go because fighting back is associated with bloodshed?
I'm sure the 10th time you copy and paste this response is the one that will convince anyone.
"please stop trying to make me thing of the impact i have on the world"
how much social credit di u get for doing this may i ask?
Politics is literally part of every consumerist activity. There are politics to get games made, politics to sell the games, politics for those who consume them. Gaming is a huge field full of capitalist exploitation. People in game development are extremely exploited. All of this is political. 

Video games have politics in them too. Just because you are too thick skulled to understand that *everything* from the water you drink to the movies you watch are political doesn't mean they aren't.
...f
Please keep going.
Says the guy adamantly trying to bury his head in the sand because he can't do without a specific video game.

You're pathetic.
You said that if you buy blood diamonds you support ethnic cleansing, therefore you think that buying blizzard games supports China. Why did you not respond to the fact that you support slavery and genocide? Why do you think that just because people arent interested in reddits outrage of the month they WANT to support China?

Someone else said it in this thread before me but I can’t find their comment right now - there’s a huge difference between taking a conscious decision as a company to support a thing and carefully crafting a campaign around it, and setting a precedent that Blizzard-run streams can be used as a platform for any person to state their political views at any time. The risk involved with the second one is unacceptable to pretty much any company, and the fact that they were trying to set a precedent probably was part of the reason the initial punishment was way too harsh.

>	Its not about following the rules. Blizz already broke them.

Just because they put something in a contract that others voluntarily sign doesn’t mean it applies to every way in which they run their business.
To be clear, I'm suggesting that if a player said "Trump 2020", they would've gotten the same 1 year ban and no prize money, but the general public wouldn't give two shits about it and we would've forgotten about it after two days.
So you didn't know they gave back the prize money and changed the bans on the player and casters to 6 months?
I’m glad your feelings have more validity than actual game sales. You think you can cash them in for prizes?
Fair point as well but there is a difference in being aware of a situation and being knowledgable enough to have a valid opinion.
 Now this is purely ancedotal so take it with a grain of salt , but recently I sat down and had a conversation with a friend who was very much in Blizzard's corner on the topic of the Blitzchung decision, but the more we talked the more I realized he had little knowledge on the subject outside of headlines. So instead of debating with him I just gave him information and linked him to a few articles on the protests and why they were happening. While he isn't boycotting blizzard, he has changed his opinion on whether blizzards action we're justifiable in that situation.
Now I'm not saying every single person who walked in and ignored the protesters was ignorant on the situation, I do believe a decent chunk of those people are under informed on the subject.
Whatever you say guy replying to 4 day old comment chain.
I mean, I am all for democracy but that is all I know. After reading about mainland Chinese and their perspective, they like what they have. So, that begs the question “Why is it up to us to force our way of life on those not asking for it?”

Historically, the United States has a very bad record when it comes to trying to invade a nation and force our political ideology.
It sounds good in theory, but China would only bow to a complete economic cutoff. We would have to coordinate a total denial of Chinese imports to budge them.
Nope. Try again.

>But on the Chinese social media platform Weibo, an official Blizzard account run by the company's Chinese publishing partner Netease took a tougher stance

They are partners. Blizzard doesn't own the weibo account nor is the team that made that post blizzard employees working for a US company. This is not a black and white issue.

>Willfully ignoring political issues so you can enjoy a video game sounds a lot more ignorant than whatever you just tried to accuse me of.

>By defending Blizzard’s actions, you are telling the people of Hong Kong that you don’t want their suffering to get in the way of your good time.

Revolution. You know? Things normally associated with lots of bloodshed?

None of which has place **at a video game tournament.**

I'm not sure if this is a difficult concept for you or you are just hugely ignorant.
> If I fight back against someone trying to kill me, are you going to tell me not to because fighting back is associated with bloodshed? Is bending over for every oppressive regime the way to go because fighting back is associated with bloodshed?

"Liberate Hong Kong, the revolution of our times"

"Fighting back"

Yeah ok buddy
> I'm sure the 10th time you copy and paste this response is the one that will convince anyone.

As opposed to the 10th time of pretending that your own nose-picking is magically a political statement?

No it really doesn't. Stop interjecting politics into random shit.
> how much social credit di u get for doing this may i ask?

> Politics is literally part of every consumerist activity. There are politics to get games made, politics to sell the games, politics for those who consume them. Gaming is a huge field full of capitalist exploitation. People in game development are extremely exploited. All of this is political.

> Video games have politics in them too. Just because you are too thick skulled to understand that everything from the water you drink to the movies you watch are political doesn't mean they aren't.

No it really doesn't. Stop interjecting politics into random shit.
> Please keep going.

I have neither the time nor the inclination to teach someone as ignorant as you.

Making random shit up is a sign of greater ignorance still. I truly didn't know it was possible for someone to be this sheltered.
I never said the movement was perfect. Again, with all the documented police brutality that is happening in Hong Kong, why are you so set on convincing people that some of the protestors are bad people?
Yeah, I got that. I am just saying the opposite.
You make a really good point. At the end of the day who knows what the actual reason for the indifference is, but thank you for having a respectful conversation about it.
Oh I wasn't aware you were looking for a reasonable and plausible idea.....just an idea lol. 

It is indeed not up to us but if we're all being honest China and its people would be much happier under a constitution and democracy.
This became a black and white issue when Blizzard HQ did not disavow or retract a statement made on THEIR game's official social media on THEIR BRAND. Not only that, they tried to double down on the "this has nothing to do with China" angle while not disavowing "we will always defend the nation's dignity".`No matey, this became a black and white issue when Blizzard still owns the Hearthstone brand. Their silence and deliberate ignoring of the weibo statement, thus letting it stand as official statement of THEIR GAME, is complicity at best, collusion at worst.
Better than pretending that everything in life can be apolitical.
i'm sorry that you want to stay so sheltered from the world
how much tho
Just chiming in because I'm not sure if you are aware that repeating yourself in the face of several lengthy, thought-out, respectful responses rather makes you sound like a child.
Two much dedication to the blade I see.
I appreciate your willingness to discuss the civilly as well, nothing can be accomplished if all we do is scream at each other.
They might be happier with democracy but they most likely would never allow you to get them there. Mainland Chinese are taught from birth that how we live is bad and selfish and how they live is good and right for all. So, you aren’t even fighting the Chinese government or military, you are fighting what the people believe. That is a pretty tough task to overcome.
That's a pretty emotional response but you do you buddy.

The translation also says "all nations' dignity". Not China's.

but hey, internet outrage machine didn't tell you that, did it?

PS before you make a stupid reply, Hong Kong is not a nation and never has been.
> Better than pretending that everything in life can be apolitical.

A video game tournament sure can be. Except idiots like you keep trying to belly-flop into the crowd screaming shit about how righteous you are. So righteous you're doing your best to try and wreck the place.

As opposed to repeating "It's a political statement when you pick your nose!!!!!" magically making it true?

Go ahead and guess my politics based on that information.

Too*

That one's free. For the rest I suggest starting at an elementary school.
Like all things it will take time. But 1 maybe 2 generations that thinking will be gone forever.
It might be an emotional response, but everything he said was right and exactly how and why it happened.
I mean, he's right.
It says the nation's dignity. Don't try to fool me, I'm a native Chinese reader. It's also posted on weibo to mainland China's audience. If you think this somehow means they're gonna defend the dignity of, idk, Venezuela, I've got a bridge on Mars I'd like to sell you.
You're right.  Video games have never had innate political statements.
but how much?
I don't think anyone suggested something as far flung as nose picking for political action. I agree that there are some political conversations I don't care to have. For example: is the meat industry bad/immoral/harming the environment? Probably, but I don't have room in my head to be "woke" on that front. I find the causes I care about, and I speak to those.

All that to say, I understand not wanting this (or any) political issue in your video game conversations. For some people though, this is the cause they care about. Best to ignore and speak to the issues you care about rather than tell people to stop representing their beliefs, in my opinion.
zzz
No doubt there. The hard part though is getting that first generation to even listen. From what I have read on here, supposedly posted by Chinese citizens, mainlanders put on a show for everyone but deep down, they love China and their way of life. So, Mt. Everest to climb.

Protip: ALL poolitics is banned. Not just ~Chinese~ politics.

Now, again:

我们对上周末炉石亚太比赛中发生的事件表示强烈愤慨与谴责，并坚决反对在任何赛事中传播个人政治理念。涉事选手将被禁赛，涉事解说将被立即终止任何官方工作。同时，**我们也将一如既往地坚决维护国家尊严。**
> You're right. Video games have never had innate political statements.

There was nothing political in that tournament until your *homeboy* forced there to be.

"The point is that all that we do has political connotations"

So what are my politics, again?

Gonna be honest, I've got to stop replying to you because I can't tell what you're trying to communicate to me.

I don't particularly mind it, considering any artistic medium I partake in is bound to have some political messaging inherent within it.
