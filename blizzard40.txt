He will not be censored.  He will ask any question.
This guy broke out of the matrix. He saw the bullshit coming from a mile away 

A true legend
He posted on r/hearthstone!

Don't you guys have phones?
What happened to red shirt guy? The guy got buff.
>Hey, huh, I was wondering, is this an out of season human rights violation?
[HE HAS RETURNED TO US](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfyjsa/proudly_supporting_blizzard_today_by_wearing/)
I just want someone to ask, ‘Given the success of WoW Classic, is there a possibility we may get Blizzard Classic in the future?’.
Ah, the red shirt clan. Members of this infamous clan are know to always find and point out Blizzard's mistakes at Blizzcon.  Whether it be lore or greedy business decisions.
Don't you guys have representative governments?
You can't silence us! We stand with Hong Kong! Revolution of our time!
Can someone link me the original? I forgot what happened.
Well, not now but 3 weeks from now :D
It's always the guys with the red shirts...
I definitely expect a spicy Q&A question
No way this is red shirt guy. Is he? What?
For he can do it, because he's not a hero.
But he’s not even the original red shirt guy
RED SHIRT GUY!!
Looking forward to 9/10 questions at the Q&A panels being about HK/China.
/r/FuckBlizzard
the hero we'll need this blizzcon
Is this an out of season june 4th joke?
He was so wrong, Blizzard is way worse than an april fool's joke, at least a joke is laughable, Blizzard is just disgusting.
I've been telling him the updates on what's going on and stuff. He's not going to Blizzcon this year unfortunately.

Holy shit I go to sleep and this has nearly 6k upvotes.  Blizzcon gonna be good this year.
he asks the questions we are afraid to ask.

or never thought of...
Blizzard has a history of guys with red shirts. In 2010 there was the guy who brought up inconsistent lore, in 2018 there was this guy mocking them for the mobile game, and this year there will be plenty of red shirt guys at the door to make sure you don’t dishonor the sovereignty of China.
Not all Heros wear capes, some only have a red shirt !
The hero we need.  But not the one we deserve...
Need to start a protest in WoW with toons transmog'd with red shirts, and defias masks.

Everyone should make pandaran toons to really drive it home.
這是一個愚蠢的愚人節笑話嗎?
I posted this over an hour ago on r/blizzard and it is still invisible: 'I have been playing Blizzard games and supporting them for the last decade since I began playing Diablo 2 in June 2009 up until the present with Overwatch with some WoW mixed in the middle in between. I can confidently say with no regrets that I can not support them at their current and presumably indefinite horse shit state and I will not be looking back. My PS4 Diablo 3 disc has been discarded and my account has been disabled after a fair deal of unwarranted stress and difficulty and multiple attempts. I hope the Chinese spunk was worth the taste.'

I posted this 30m ago on r/hongkong and it is still invisible: 'I know that it seems obvious at this point, however I and 2 other discord friends tried to submit a post to the board and it has been delayed for 30 or more minutes for each of us while showing that no new posts were created for over an hour. As soon as a post on r/hearthstone mentioned that the submissions seem to be bottlenecked yesterday I have frequently observed 1 to 2 hour time gaps where my posts seem to be submitted to the void and no new ones will appear.'
Yeah I noticed that since I toggled on new posts and all "new" posts are from hours ago
Actually no, Reddit is censoring this subreddit banning accounts from the whole of Reddit.
[removed]
Yea something wonky is happening with submissions.
how is this revolution of our age?
Blizzard (China) is censoring this sub reddit.
Censoring? As a april fools joke?
"THEY ARE NOT PREPARED!!!"
I absolutely took the piss out of this guy at the time. It seemed like an over the top reaction. "Oh no, a mobile game. Blizzard is still working on a proper Diablo game, they're not selling out to China etc"

I was completely wrong about the situation, and fair play to the lad. He called it well in advance.
Redshirt Dude for world president!
Don't you guys have kidneys?  

Seriously, Comrade Xi is running low, off to the camp you go.
Don't you guys have tegridy?
Don't you guys have **Human Rights**?
Don't you guys not have dignity?
Dont you guys have souls?
Don't you guys have freedom?
dont  you guys love chinhchong ? /s
 Don't you guys have social credit?
There's season for that?

I'm off to buy some equipment.
You mean getting a company that was once considered one of the best and made excellent games instead of super polished esports platforms where every thing is balanced to death so no matter what you play it's always the same?
*"Ah, yes, 'Democracy'. The form of government allegedly practiced in civilised parts of the world. We have dismissed this claim."*
Context: This was right after the announcement that Diablo was mobile-only and the infamous "DO YOU GUYS NOT HAVE PHONES?????" line.

~~I think immediately after that, we got the infamous "DO YOU GUYS NOT HAVE PHONES?????" line.~~

EDIT: Fixed the timeline of events.
Huh?
If they don't just straight up cancel the QA Panels.
I'm really hoping the angst sticks until then/ the people going can put their fanboi aside to fight for democracy and human rights.
You might be referring to Ian, the first red shirt guy. I am in fact definitely going to Blizzcon this year.
Do you not have a phone? lol
I'm out of the loop on this guy specifically. Who is he?
Or you could stop giving them money.
Hahaha nice!   
For everyone to lazy to translate "is this a stupid april fools joke?"
The 2nd half posted on hongkong refers to the r/blizzard subreddit
There are thousands of posts like yours still up, why would they censor yours? What about all the other anti-China posts that are hitting the front page from other subs? Why would they try to censor anything when the vast majority of stuff will be seen? I don't know your posts are 'invisible' (and I know I'll get downvoted for thus) but I'm not sure we should immediately chalk it up to censorship. In a time like this it's easy to blame everything that goes wrong on China, but sometimes you just have to look at a situation objectively.
What's the source of the picture? I hope there's a video
Approval mode.
That's not true. I just have been banned there. It's worse than this sub :D
I was with him the whole time and glad to be there.
the important thing is you have the ability to change and saw you were wrong, it takes a lot to do that.
or at least as a mod for this sub
That makes it two red shirt guys, I wonder if this one will get an NPC in game as well..
WORLDSTAR
don't you guys have innards?
I grow my own phones
Don’t you guys stand up for the sovereignty of China?
I disagree with that completely. We can shit on blizzard all day and night for their completely asinine decision making but game balance is not generally in that category.    

Starcraft has massive visual/cost/playstyle distinctions between races. 

Warcraft 1/2/3 was the same way. WoW has gone through a number of iterations on balance but class identity has traditionally been very strong.  

Diablo 3 is a clusterfuck of stupid ideas but the classes do play differently from one another. 

Overwatch is really diverse on playstyle/character selection. 

Hearthstone has an infinite number of decktypes. 

What game were you thinking of specifically when you talked about balance?
Thank you! I remember watching it live but forgot what the guy said.
Not immediately after that. That infamous line comes as a response after the question by LordFluffy if Blizzard plans to bring Diablo Immortal to PC and Wyatt said no.
Am i remembering it wrong or was he promptly kicked off the blizzcon by security right after the camera wasn't looking at him?
You know red shirt guy? If this is the same dude, he definitly never skipped the gym
Or screen the questions and have an employee read them
It's the only reason I would buy a virtual ticket...
You are going to Blizzcon? I thought you weren't?
It was last Blizzcon, Diablo Immortal announcement Q&A: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJy6bJ\_RxXg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJy6bJ_RxXg)
The guy who single handedly brought blizzards stock down by 50%
Yeah thanks... I was going for snarky humor vs. the chinese bullshit... everyone should learn that phrase in mandarin and recite it at Blizzcon... and wear red shirts and masks.
[removed]
Look up out of season April fools joke blizcon on YouTube
>Hearthstone has an infinite number of decktypes.

But people only play like, 5.
D'oh! I had a feeling I wasn't remembering things right...
Nah, I was there all weekend and about 200 people stopped me for selfies and high fives. Even employees were pulling me aside to have conversations. It made an otherwise lackluster blizzcon very entertaining. The best part and I mean BY FAR the best.... it made my wife so uncomfortable HAHAHA.
I don't remember. Wouldn't surprise me if he was, though.

EDIT: Trying to see if his interviews could shed more light on that...

EDIT 2: No idea if he was kicked out, but apparently when he went into the SC II Q&A line the next day to ask an *actual* question, the screener said that they couldn't trust him and pulled him out of the Q&A line.

EDIT 3: Couldn't find any info on if he was escorted out by security, but considering he came back the next day and attempted to ask another question at a Q&A, he probably wasn't.
I was there he did not get kicked out.  He was the hero of Blizzcon.
I am the red shirt Diablo guy. I've been skipping the gym last 2 weeks, they're relocating. I'm getting squishy, sucks.
They'll probably add a question submission form to the Blizzcon app and just read approved questions from that.
Same here. And i'm not savvy enough to know the alternate means of watching it.
I wasn't planning on it earlier in the year because none of my friends were going to go. Suddenly it's ticket purchasing day and ALL of my friends want to go. So we bought tickets and we're going.
Judging by the fact that you called me "commie tard" it's evident that you aren't open to discussion nor willing to consider an alternate point of view. Given this information, there's no point in continuing this argument. Please note that I never supported China I just didn't 100% agree with your view point. But apparently to you this issue is so black and white, which shows that you clearly don't have a good understanding of the matter at all, yet another reason this discussion isn't worth continuing. Maybe try to be a little less extreme in the future?

Edit: Also your removed post has no context attached to it. I cannot see the content and therefore have no reason to believe it is victim to censorship.
as if meta doesn't exist in literally every competitive game
were the employees dissing you?
I know a few good content creators that hit all the high points in reviews, and as always I could just read the summaries somewhere, but that isn't nearly as fun as watching it all going on.

That is the only thing that would get me to buy a ticket, and even that is a hard sell for me with everything that is going on.
Do you plan on getting on the microphone again?
Not really. They were just happy to talk.
No. I don't know what will happen at all.
