"Cease your existence"
[If you think China influencing your video game companies is bad, wait until you learn about their influence over American universities.](https://quillette.com/2018/12/23/american-universities-china-problem/)
:(

Don't associate pure and innocent orisa with this mess. You know she would be standing up for HK.
Bizzard
I legit laughed at this. Well done.

I love Orisa voicelines
China need to do the “No child at all policy”

Wipe those brainwashed shitters out.
Efi will not be happy about this.

That would be the Uighurs. They don't get to play hearthstone in concentration camps though so we don't need to worry about them.
There influence over the whole world is sickening. Fuck China.
I've heard from multiple Chinese students that they're sure some of the other Chinese students are (possibly unwilling) government informants.
People's safety is her primary concern, after all.
That's a good point
True. Make all Overwatch characters in favor of Hong Kong. Well...maybe not Reaper.
She's a fictional character. She's part of Blizzard's brand and intellectual property. She doesn't have feelings.
Cause all they care about is Bizz-Ness
You are the worst person.
Aight
What is this cringe?
Are...are you going to be alright? Lmfao
Privilege? Not a right? Explain. This isn’t China.
What the actual fuck is this?
Bro you just posted cringe
Guys, we've got the CEO of cringe over here!
delete this bullshit and get the fuck outta here
Cant stream video games when your organs are being harvested and your wife is being raped ^^^^before ^^^^her ^^^^scheduled ^^^^organ ^^^^harvest , ya know?
Sometimes I wish MacArthur could go full ahead with his plan
I'll take bullshit for 500
They are advised to move behind her barrier.
Reaper has a grudge against an organization that acted like global enforcers, resorting to military force when needed, and then left him to die when it was convenient.

He'd definitely hate the CCP at the very least.
Damn I had no idea! Thanks for pointing out this hidden fact!
They're all fictional characters but they should not stand for something like this. Orisa stands up for the individual and the underdog. She should not have to be associated with something like this.
Yikes.
Oof.

You need to calm down
I mean you could stream the organ harvest maybe.
He was the hero we needed
To be honest, I don't play it much. I just thought he was the "bad guy"
Oof.

Cringe 100
Sir, please stop yelling
People will watch just about anything on Twitch, I suppose! New profit avenues for China incoming.
Well yeah, thats the gimmick. Typical anti-hero thing, being all scary and murder-ey but actually working for the greater good.
