I shared this on my insta story, thanks!

Edit: I made it a "highlight" story as well and the Mei fits perfectly in the little circle :)
Overwatch banned in China when?
I love it.
This is amazing! Thank you!
Would love this as a T-shirt!

The world is worth fighting for
This needs more upvotes and needs to be put all over
I'm out of the loop. Did blizzard say something stupid about the HK protests or something?
When did this sub come back? Was private yesterday after all the backlash lol
Love your art very much, but Hongkongers no longer use that chinese-made flag as their national flag
#MeiWithHongKong

Want you to know that your poster is out in full force in the streets of Hong Kong right now.

Welp, this has become my avatar on every social media account I have. Thanks!
So cute!
I'm gonna spread this too, yeet.
Put this as a shirt, make a bunch. Go to blizzcon and hand them out
That's just too cute.
Mei speaks Mandarin though, and HK is a Cantonese protest. Don’t think the word “her” is appropriate
Oh I love it!
I made a 1440p wallpaper out of this: [https://ibb.co/jMBdPFM](https://ibb.co/jMBdPFM)  
I hope its okay for you op, just moved your watermark to the bottom right.
Those need to be printed out and pinned on every Corner in HK. Make Flyers. Make it a real Icon of the Movement.
Why use red if red is the colour of the government?

Edit: I mean, red in the word "liberate"
Has there been any signs of people in Hong Kong using her?
I love it. Well done!
Good!
This is impressive as shit
Blizzard now is my hero
do you a twitter or somewhere i can follow your stuff?
waiting for china to ban OverWatch because of that, it would be so funny
This is awesome, and you should feel awesome
She cant do it at all if she's chinese
Now that Overwatch has been banned in China... use a StarCraft character. Once Starcraft gets banned, use a Warcraft character. 

For the Swarm! For Azeroth!
Bastion for Hong Kong
This is everywhere on Reddit rn
This is so good! Would make a legit sticker on anything really, even just the drawing itself has the flower, you could sell many versions (full, partial, drawing only) online as T-shirts n mugs etc and make some money
I’ve shared it to r/blizzard
ayy nice
This is beautiful.

Thank you.
Thank you man :) Had to to modify it a bit to fit it as background on my phone (Galaxy S8, WQHD+ size 2960 x 1440)

Gonna put it also here for ppl want to use it also as background [https://imgur.com/MVBGxwc](https://imgur.com/MVBGxwc)

No problem. Happy to help.
She's fighting for her right to freedom of expression and we must too. This is our last chance to prove that we value freedom over money.
Not yet, but soon.
They may not ban overwatch but they may end up disowning mei, which would also be interesting.
Mei is being turned into an icon for the Hong Kong revolution in hopes it will cause Overwatch to be banned in China.
We can only hope.
a-mei-zing!
I could do the template, but i would be unable to sell lol.
Shits like this and the other one would be amazing.  I wish there was a way we could use them raise money for Hong Kong protestors.
Thought this was trash spam but the links the dude provided are legit. Holy fuckin shit.
Banned a hearthstone player for 12 months, revoked his tournament winnings, and fired the casters who did the interview because he spoke in support of Hong Kong.

A punishment of some kind would be reasonable as blizzard doesn’t want their tournaments to become soapboxes for politics, however this was an extremely heavy handed move clearly done to appease China.
Going back to the British one?  Or something homegrown like an umbrella?
I have no problem with it.
Yes, It was used in a protest
Sadly no :(
Wait, it's banned now?
You can't sell them?
SidAlpha is very good at providing all his sources
Shit like this is why I only play indie games (and also bc my laptop cant handle high budget games)
Not to forget their public apology to China.
I seem to have jumped the gun on this one. It's not banned yet. But the Mei memes have made it to Hong Kong, so it might only be a matter of time. But it is not banned at this moment.
Have you played hollow knight? It’s a fantastic  game.
Yeah, especially putting out different statements in English and Mandarin (in the latter of which Blizzard said they, an American company, would "always defend the pride of our country").
Aw man, got me excited.
Yeah but my ex gf ruined it for me so I never finished it lol
Good, then you can spend your time playing CrossCode instead.
I'm gonna need a synopsis on that one
Ah it's nice to see another CrossCode player in the wild as it were :D
Short version: It's an action RPG with excellent combat, surprisingly solid platforming for a game with no jump button and a top down perspective, great writing, memorable characters, and a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor. Think the combat of Ys meets the puzzle solving elements of Zelda.

Long version... [I may have gone a little overboard and wrote a review that was more than twice as long as Steam would allow me to post.](https://videogamegeek.com/thread/2074179/)
