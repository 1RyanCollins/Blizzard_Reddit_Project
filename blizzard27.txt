Yeah fuck blizzard I'm done with their games
It was a nice run Activision
Done with Blizzard, BEEN DONE with Activision. I'm so ashamed of these decisions.
Also Blizzard: We will continue to protect the dignity of the Chinese government. Worldwide
#If you or anyone your know plans on deleting their account, don't just delete your account! You can request your Data from Blizzard and if they dont follow trhough within 30 days they have to pay hefty fines inside the EU. If everyone does this, they might have such an enormous backlog and will have to pay up.

Thank you!

Blizzard: "Of course you are free to express your individual thoughts and opinions.......*IN HELL"*
"As long as those opinions make us money!"
I'm conflicted if I'm still buying modern warfare honestly.
...If he's still able after we're done with him.
I'm still confused. Every big company kowtows to China. Why should Blizzard be any different? 

If you're going to boycott them then you might as well boycott Apple and a ton of other companies for doing similar things in different mediums.
only when corrupting western kids. makes you wonder who was paying blizzard when trash like that is forced in to games 🤔
Tracer is a lesbian.
I can't figure out how to play this freakin game. The client doesn't let me login despite my credentials being absolutely correct. The block chain nonsense makes no sense to me either. Idk if I'm just old or stupid
Seriously? Where can I see this?
Eh not really. Sometimes it’s more effective to target 1 or 2 companies and really, really make them hurt to make and example and send a message to all the other companies.
Producing in a country and outright saying “yeah fuck human rights gimme MONEY” are two very different things
Man what?
Not in the chinese version of Overwatch lol

I'm OK with that actually. The way I see it is every business above a certain threshold starts to believe they are invincible. It's good to knock them down.
'Producing in a country' sounds so innocent. How about 'moved production to a country with known human rights issues, and turning a blind eye to said worker abuse, while knowing this would result in wealth being taken from the American people and sent to China, all in the name of literally making more money than they know what to do with.'
When did they say that?
Huh. Might join then
I can’t be asked to explain everything wrong with what you’re saying. It’s simple economics, they are a business looking to make money so they produce in a country with low wages due to a surplus of workers. So yes “sounds innocent” is correct, as the company is not the ones who are corrupt, they are just acting as a company should.
> they are a business looking to make money

No matter the consequences. That's the problem. Even big business CEO's are starting to write articles in Forbes along the lines of 'Maybe this whole philosophy of profit before everything else wasn't a good idea. We're ruining everything.'.
