I'm 99% positive that BlizzCon is going to have a "dress code" requiring people to not wear that.
Don't even support them by buying a ticket, protest by the entrances make it difficult for them
Don‚Äôt buy anything while you‚Äôre there either
I dont have tickets to BlizzCon but will be driving thw 4 hours to Aneheim to be a pro free speech asshole in the parking lot. Any place to organize?
\*black
Go. Make sure your voice is heard. And pop a pro Hong Kong t-shirt or cap in your pocket, and change in the toilet.

You bought the tickets long before this debacle, and asking for a refund just means they could sell it to someone who will support blizzard instead.

Don't be silent.
this is disrespectful to [red shirt guy](https://youtu.be/fFnGjyPYxjM) .
If we want to send a message, we have to target the sponsors.
NO!  People who are slated to go should protest just inside the gates.  Don't walk all the way in, just gum up the entrance.
I honestly think blizzcon will get canceled this year.
Everytime i post this i get so heavily downvoted i have to delete it. Glad you made it homie
Red or black. I've heard both.

This whole "movement" is going in different directions.
Red shirt guy was a prophet
ball is in blizzards court. if they choose to censor their own con that's the straw. I have only ever been a casual player of blizzard but I am making it a priority to help others understand the scope of the betrayal. 

they need to be ejected from Western markets if they want to align themselves with a government that commits active genocide
They can‚Äôt stop all of us
yes yes yes!
black shirts!! not red!!
Just pretend you're a fan of Red Shirt Guy if security ask any questions.
I know there's a lot of nerds tempted to buy merchandise but stop being addicted and support Hong Kong Protest... seriously.
I prefer Black shirt  
or with a helmet too!
Why use shirts with the colour of their government? Use black with a white Hong Kong symble, looks better imo and stays away from the colour of their shitty government.
Wrong attitude.

&#x200B;

It sohuld read:  
"Blizzcon is coming up and we should all cancel our ticket purchases"
I suspect they will almost definitely turn people away coming in like that citing a dress code violation or some other bullshit coverup. However shirts are well, layerable if you catch my very obvious drift.

Wear something black over it and when the livestream starts panning to the audience, a mass reveal could be pretty badass.....until they cut the feed seconds later of course.
If any information about *Diablo: Immortal* comes out at Blizzcon, particularly characters, they should immediately be made into symbols of freedom for Hong Kong to get the game banned in China.

This could kill the Chinese mobile revenue Blizzard so desperately wants.
I'd also like a call for their CEO to resign.
We should also sing "do you hear the people sing"
Black is the color of the Hong Kong protesters
Yes this. Also, vote with your wallet - if action is not taken by Blizzard to walk this back, reverse the narrative here, I'll never buy Blizzard again. Already submitted my request for account deletion.
Blizzard staff picks you to ask question. You: "Yeah, I'm pirating Diablo 4."
Yeesyeyeyysysyeysyyseyyeyeysysysususesyesssss
They will show some character and new lootboxes for their kid hero shooter, some p2w cards for their children's card game, some more anduin shit story for their elitist mmo, and D4 for people who think D3 was anything above mediocre and you all will shut up because your memory only knows what happened in the last 48 hours then it resets and you will continue to consume.

Also for blizz workers, don't know how much like an slave they treat you over there, but you work for an evil company, you are as guilty as the company, leave or be evil but don't get offended when you called evil.
What if every attendee is red shirt guy
Black shirt, take a backpack and put a gas mask and umbrella in it. Change in the bathroom. Make yourself seen.
They can‚Äôt ban us all raid Blizzard HQ
isnt it black shirts with masks? or red shirts so it can be seen more hmmm
Everyone who already bought tickets, protest inside.
Everyone who didn't but are still able to go to the area, protest outside.
  

**Want to make a big difference? Write to your congressman about Blizzard.**

Ask them to make the CEO of Activision Blizzard testify to congress.

Find your representative: [https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)

Here's a sample letter.

Dear Congressman,

I am a constituent. I write with concern regarding Chinese assault on American values and the use of American companies as a proxy for this behavior. As senator Rubio put it well - " China \[is\] using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally. "

A number of American companies, including Apple, the NBA, and Activision Blizzard, have recently taken action to appease China and in particular the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). A quick review of recent news provides all the detail that is necessary. In particular, Activision Blizzard censored and revoked prize money for a Hong Kong-based contestant for making a political message during an interview. No doubt this is due to their increasing revenue share from China.

The CEO of Activision Blizzard (and other companies) should be compelled to testify before Congress and explain why they are placing revenue and profit over western values and our country. They should be forced to explain why they allow their products ‚Äì computer games consumed by millions of Americans and many young people ‚Äì to be used as a proxy to carry Chinese values, such as censorship, to the west.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
u cant say free hk. say free china insteadüòê
Wear masks just like the protestors common do one better!
The best way to have our voices heard is to rent a space nearby and have a convention for communists with tiny penises support groups.
We should refund the ticket
Umbrellas, bring all unbreellas and open them inside.
Free Wu Kong!
Or you could just... not go.
Why would this get censored?
Something tell me, nothing will happen.

We are talking about the same cowards who dont let people having certain sign inside venue of the event from blizzard (ex : pepe the frog meme)

I highly doubt people will be able to get in with free hong kong sign or anything related to that.

The best thing people could do is to shout something like Free hong kong during speech and the only thing Blizzard could do about it is to cut the stream, which will be a massive win and prove to the world what a bunch of shit tier coward Blizzard has become.
[removed]
The endgame should be finding a way to get *Diablo: Immortal* banned in China. Turn it into a protest symbol.

This would cripple the Chinese mobile market revenue they so desperately seek.
[removed]
Wear black please. Red is a pro-china colour.
simply don't go
Thank you for your support but i would say wearing black is better than red since red is most likely representing pro-china
Black and yellow, not red. Also please have Uygur related stuff.

Nevermind all of you go there, and every time they talk walk away.
there are plenty designs at tee public dot com. Just search hong kong and sortbby newest.
Or don‚Äôt buy a ticket, therefore not giving them any money.
Are virtual tickets for Blizzcon available in China? Because if they are, that would be an amazing performance!
No,make them bk
Black thats the colour that they use
If you own a ticket and they womt refund show up and be as obnoxious as you can, if you can get a refund but you have your plane tickets and hotel reservations well then why not take a vacation a d hang out there for a few days 

Just a thought
I didn't buy tickets this year because I was so disgusted last year, I wish I did now, I would wear one
BlizzCon is gonna be a shitshow of epic scale. I can't wait!!
no, sneak in/fake tickets, and wear a black t shirt on top because there will 100% be a dress code
seriously? you should refund your tickets.
How about instead of wearing red shirts why not just dont turn up? You're still lining their pockets so they wont care what colour you wear if you turn up
Have I always needed to submit an image of my ID to prove im the holder of the account? That just sounds hyper wrong, in every way.
or just boycott Blizzcon. The biggest impact we can have on Blizzard is by affecting its finances.
So...paying for a company we hate to show how much we hate them?
How bout that Bobby Kotick being involved with Jeff Epstein?
Or better yet, just don't show up.
just dont go
did blizzard enslave hong kong or something
We wear BLACK not red
Wrath of the Red Shirt III: Liberation
Sure as long as you don't buy a ticket and just stand outside.  Otherwise you accomplished nothing.
At cost stickers, plaster them at the con:::: https://www.redbubble.com/people/faunkyfaux/works/41654848-liberate-hong-kong-revolution-of-our-time-mei-fights-for-rights?asc=u
Red shirts to something that is anti China? LOL.
What's funny is Blizzard is probably going to make a killing off this Blizzcon with the virtual ticket because of the HK debacle.
Should we get them made in china?
Charge back guys. Call your bank or go in and dispute the charge.
No, they need to be black.
Man they're not going to be able to show blizzcon....woah
I'm really curious about how Blizzcon attendees will respond to this. 

Rooster Teeth faced some similar drama when right before RTX 2019 it was revealed their animation department were crunching hard to meet deadlines. The RT fan community seemed split between using RTX as a vehicle to protest the company's poor decisions vs those who thought it would be unfair to hijack the con from those who paid tickets to see it. RT addressed the problems before the show luckily so it had mostly blown over by the time RTX came along, but I wonder what proportion of Blizzcon attendees are engaged enough with it all to use it as a chance to protest/disrupt the show.
Better yet don't go
it's easier if you don't go, just saying
Liberate Blizzard! Revolution of our Industry!
Guys - don't plan your action of resistance in a public forum.  You're going to get screen sniped by corporate.  You have 3 weeks.
blizcon is coming up, and that bitch better be empty. They don't care if you protest in america, they are sucking china's teet and pivoting to mobile anyway.  


Just don't even buy tickets.
I am so down, but first i need to find a shirt or make my own.

**BLACK PLZ**

Hong Kong people are glad becoz you guys do that.

**BUT BLACK PLZ IF U WANT TO SUPPORT HONG KONG PROTESTORS.**
Or not attended, maybe. Just a thought.
If you arrive in a freeHK shirt and they don‚Äôt let you in, FORCE YOUR WAY IN they cannot stop all of you
A "Free Hong Kong" shirt will probably get you ejected there (I am going and I did check the T&Cs). Although I don't think they can really do anything if I just wear a shirt with the HK flag printed on it. It'll definitely deliver the message without that obnoxious "in your face" attitude that some people seem to bring to the table that probably did literally nothing to support Hong Kong this far. Smart support yeah, jumping on the bandwagon is a bit stupid imho.
Blizzard, you are the best! +1000. China, be strong. Blizzard too
How about just not going?

You're still supporting them if you go.

But I guess videogames at important, right?
Check out #BoycottBlizzcon on twitter for more information. We're gonna disrupt these fools. 

 [https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoycottBlizzcon?src=hashtag\_click](https://twitter.com/hashtag/BoycottBlizzcon?src=hashtag_click)
 What is wrong with people?? This action by Blizzard does not say they   support China against Hong Kong, it just says they do not permit   politics in gaming venues which is absolutely understandable. If they   allowed one instance, they will need to allow all - a pro chinese gamer   spewing stuff about Hong Kong too, some Israeli guy about Palestine and   vice versa, Trump haters, etc... Next thing you know their tournaments   would be a venue for polarizing political statements. I'm sure all  this  controversy is because that particular political issue was against  most  of what the western players uphold, but if it was an issue they  agreed  with they would have totally understood the decision... I'm  saddened to  see the west not upholding their own values and being  unable to separate  emotions from sound judgement. Really pathetic and  saddening. Blizzard  does not deserve all this hate for a sound decision  based on a contract,  for a very perfectly reasonable reasoning. People  seem to be dying to be in a situation to be self righteous, such people  probably do not enjoy anything anyway... shame... Oh and before anyone  says I'm from China or something - I'm Egyptian.
If you actually gave a shit you wouldn't go at all
If you're actually upset about this and have a ticket, please stay home. Some of us will be there trying to have a good time.
Blizzcon is coming up and nobody should actually go there!
How about not showing up
The best would be to not go, even if you have a ticket
Funny how anyone who says to not go to blizcon gets down votes
[deleted]
Or not show up at all and cancel Blizzcon tickets because that‚Äôs their paycheck.
[deleted]
Wear it underneath a black shirt and then take the black shirt off once you're inside with a bunch of other people doing the same thing. Would definitely send a message.
They can try that. Harder they will try to enforce something, even harder they will be eventually hit back.

I dont see Blizzard coming back from this. If I was Activision CEO, I would just cut my losses and sell Blizzard to whoever is able to buy it.
Ill still wear it lmao
Too late, it's sold out and non-refundable. Best way to make your voice heard is to go.
As many protestors as possible need to make it *inside* and here is why 

Blizzard livestreams Blizzcon live as both a promotionlal tool and revenue generator 

What we need to do is get some kind of Pro Hong Kong message shouted, yelled at every camera at every opportunity 

Panels , QAs, etc - Do not let Blizzard get away with a clean broadcast

They will have to choose between Pissing off China and scrubbing Blizzcon off the internet /cancelling streams

This will inevtiably hurt their wallet , they can choose between not making any virtual ticket money or pissing of the entire chinese market

up to them, they dont get to suck Chinese dick and enjoy our western liberal values at the same time 

Force them to choose
Wear mei or pandaren cosplay with Hong Kong support.
If you already bought a ticket, show up with a protest shirt under a cover shirt. Wait until you are on camera (a live broadcast would be best) and then take off your cover shirt.
You've spent your money. Use it more wisely. Don't be silenced. Use your voice.
No people won't do that because they're not really all that upset, they just want their upvotes. Of course they're still gonna go to the con, they paid money for it and it's something they wanna do.
Or just don‚Äôt go?
you could try but the way they have security set up now you wouldnt even beable to protest outside the convention unless you have a badge. You would literally be either on the sidewalk which is like 500 yards away where no one would see you or the parking lot structure where again no one could see :( you would more or less be kept with the crowds with the Hardcore christian groups that say were all going to hell...
Yeah you‚Äôll look just like those people who stand outside comic con with signs that says you‚Äôll go to hell if you‚Äôre gay. Enjoy that experience.
>pro free speech asshole

That's not a thing
Red because Op is pro-communist
Blizzcon seems to have trouble with people and red shirts.
someone knows how to follow the money
No! Go Inside! Everything is crowded with journalists, streamer, youtuber and the keynote is going to be streamed, too! Wear HongKong-Flag T-Shirts! So that on every Photo & Video the voices of freedom will be heard. If they try to censor it, then they can probably put out only 2 pictures and a silent Video cuz everybody‚Äòs screaming ‚ÄûFREE HONG KONG‚Äú anyways. 
Use the Medium and power they use to spread their information to SPREAD OUR VOICE!

Imagine every Blizzcon Visitor doing this. The blizzcon itself isnt even interesting anymore for the media itself. 


Turn this BLIZZCON INTO A PROTESTCON !


https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfekc6/please_dont_let_this_die/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
That's just being obnoxious to the visitors and it allows Blizzard to play the victim card. Take an example from the Hong Kong protesters who go out of their way to minimise how much they're inconveniencing their fellow citizens.
No, DO walk in. Make sure that every photo taken of the event has a shitton of people supporting Hong Kong. All the press will be about nothing but that.
no, everyone needs to force them to choose between live broadcrasting blizzcon or scrubbing it 


if too many people ask about hong kong in QAs, Shout about it on Live streams , etc 

Blizzard will have to choose between China and scrubing Blizzcon off the internet or the rest of us
I honestly think people forgot about what we are protesting for by the time blizzcon starts.
Come on now...
People paid money  people planned things. Don't think this will happen but 100% there will be protesters inside, visible on stream, shouting at panels and probably some get kicked. Think that likely is and a good message at least.
Not necessarily. I just think it will be say a little Chinese in flavor. 

The streams will have a nice delay, so they can cut out some unwanted stuff before it even has a chance to spread. Should there be Q&A sessions, they will be heavily moderated. Attendees will be thoroughly searched for protesting gear / banners. 

Basically if something happens contain it to the Con itself and double down on the measures to prevent it from happening in first place.
If this situation gets worse, it will.

There will be too many people to control for them to take this risk at this time. 

It needs to get a bit worse first, but they have only a few weeks till it begins, and they wouldn't cancel it last minute - so if they *do* cancel it, it would have to happen by next week.
This is team red shirt guy he hated blizzard before all this he had a voice and so will we
lol 
cant wait to see that.
Yes exactly they going to be looking for guys with blackshirts umbrellas and gas masks
Yeah. My thoughts too. Red = commie for years and years now.
For red shirt guy the first person to stand up to blizzard
Non refundable
Black clothing is too common to be noticed as a symbol.  You would need a mask, a flag, or some other unique symbol to make an irrefutable statement.
The employees can‚Äôt be taken guilty for the company‚Äôs decision, they need their jobs to survive.
It is to say f you again for diablo and honor the guy who asked about the out of date april joke, maybe.
You don‚Äôt know about red shirt guy?
[deleted]
Whoa now
It will be nice trolling and good protest
The security is really tight, the ticket is a digital QR code that changes every 60 seconds, I doubt that anyone would be able to pass with a fake ticket.
So the tickets can go to actual Blizzard supporters?

No thanks. Chaos will ensue.
Tickets are non refundable from I've heard.
Showing up in protest, showing up with symbols of the protest, the Hong Kong flag, etc. sends a direct message to Blizzard and their PRC overlords.

All relevant news from Blizzcon will be broadcast to millions.  It's entirely possible to create enough of a stink to make China outright terminate all dealing with Activision Blizzard.
From what I know, this was a thing for some time, people just never realized because they never tried to delete their accounts.
It‚Äôs a protest the tickets where already sold out
This time it‚Äôs red it has sentimental value
shall we naruto run in ?
> But I guess videogames at important, right?

Getting your voice heard at an event with a) a massive international audience and b) the utmost attention of the company that is trying to silence those voices actually does make sense though; Especially considering that the tickets are not refundable so the boycotting aspect doesn't really work (which would otherwise be a valid approach of course).
So what's the activision blizzard paycheck in Egypt? Good enough to survive a whole month on? I know western companies love oppressive regimes as that gives them cheap, almost slave, labor. Hell, Trump is trying to implement that in the US as we speak.
The sun in egypt is clearly hitting you to hard.blizzard is appeasing china.a country who is bathed in blood.hong kong is fighting for freedom,and they ban a player,revoke his HARD earnings for speaking out?a fine would have been enough if they wanted to keep politics away from the tournament.maybe,at most,a 2 months suspension.this is clearly pandering to a country that glorifies suppression.you have no idea what your talking about.get your shit together.what you wrote is disgusting
How much were you paid for this shitty comment? Not like you would understand anything about Hong Kong anyways given your countries proclivity for killing those you don‚Äôt agree with
Tickets were sold out long before the blitzchung ban, people may already have plans about staying  somewhere, since they already have the arrangements why not?
Do you not have a phone/human rights?
I‚Äôm going too. I really would like to enjoy the event despite all the mistakes Blizzard is making because I‚Äôm not guilty of it. I come from a poor country and I‚Äôve gathering money for a long time so I would be able to realize this dream travel. But honestly, I think that there will be very little protest because most of the protesters now are only people trying to get attention on the internet and the hate cycle will be turned against something else when the event time comes.
That doesn't achieve anything though.
No, people need to go. You can't be heard sitting at home, patting yourself on the back for not attending something you already paid for. However, you can help keep the momentum going by protesting publicly!! Voices need to be heard.
It‚Äôs a protest we need our voice heard
People already bought non-refundable tickets most of them have made plans with airlines, and hotels near by among other things. No point to tell them not to go for those that decide to protest should be giving a chance to at least protest in some way.
As everyone else said the tickets are already bought and are non-refundable so the best course of action is to go and PROTEST
It‚Äôs a protest we need our voices heard and you really think no one will show up to a sold out event? If we get enough press at their event we will get more eyes
People are already planning on wearing black shirts instead, since it's the color of the protesters
BLACK is the colour code for the HK protest, RED is the Chinazi colour instead
Wear printed shirts with large letters and meanings underneath. 

#F 
to pay respects
#R 
to reload
#E 
to equip

Etc.

Get a bunch of people to spell out Free Hong Kong
Black is the official color of HK protestors
\*disney drooling for the chance\*
No. The best way to protest would be to not go in. Leave them with empty floors. Protest in front of the venue with your ticket in hand.
I was able to refund mine
Then go but dont enter. Protest in front of blizzcon eventhough you have a ticket. Press will make pictures of empty blizzcon halls despite sold out and protestors massively in front outside of blizzcon.
Uhhh no. Just don't go. It's that simple.
I hope people will really voice their opinion there. But only few people will risk getting thrown out after paying 200$.
Non-refundable? Bet. I‚Äôll file a claim with my bank. They will get it back for you.
It can be non-refundable all they like. You can charge back with the bank
They will regulate their q and a. But we know blizzard has people who don't agree. Try and get someone in there. No need to ask about human rights. Just something uncomfortable enough to let them know we got past them.
So they air these brodcasts in China?
Because a lot of the people that purchased the non refundable tickets are probably planning on going to protest.
Enough people and it doesn't matter where they are. They will be seen.
Yeah--it is. See: anyone that defends racism, sexism, etc., using "free speech."
What about a very angry libertarian?
inb4 "No national shirts or protesting allowed in blizzcon" lol
Tbh if someone was going to blizzcon not to protest then I wouldn‚Äôt really care
Yea but isnt blizzcon like next week? If it were 2 months from now i'd agree but the wound is still fresh.
yeah i totally agree, people are all emotionnal about it right now but with time, ea or an another company will do something and the outrage of the week will move on them and everyone will forget about the coward at blizzard.

which is sad.
People will indeed have forgiven/forgotten enough by then.
The total revenue of the event would never match the potential losses they can have from one bad moment that goes viral.

Never forget that. Money can printed, it's on paper. Your image though, that takes a very long time to rebuild or rediscover.

China's never cared about money - they are devaluing Yuan on purpose to keep business relations with the world - just to stick it to the US Dollar. They care about their image and what their citizens think of their government.
Yes but it's not exactly relevant to this current situation. Just saying, there's gonna be people protesting the same thing using different mediums, not very unified.
Well, the irony xD but he isn't with China and at that moment, the concerns were about the mobile game, today the concern is freedom.
Everything is refundable.
The deposit/reservation fee can be non-refundable if it is deemed fair.
They can not claim the entire cost of the ticket to be a reservation and still claim it to be fair. 

Then there is the fact that you can always chargeback.
it's possible to continue working for blizzard while submitting resumes to other companies. the problem is where do you submit that doesn't have tencent involved.
So as the soldiers/commanders/generals who shot people dead in brutal dictatorships. You know the company is evil yet you decide to work for them to make money, it's as bad as company's decisions.
Oh I do but the HK protesters wear black with umbrellas. red t-shirt guy might be interpreted differently since it's a color of good luck in China. To reference red t shirt guy you need to be in front of a camera asking awkward questions which I hope happens to address the giant elephant that will be at Blizzcon
Full speed ahead
Yes, because shitposting will surely help.

I'm sure you sitting comfortably in your chair/bed posting memes on reddit will make the protesters who got tear gassed feel so much better.
then let's sneak into blizzcon! they can't arrest all of us, right?
Nah wont make a difference, you have already lined their pockets so why would they care? A company who only cares about money can only be hit in 1 way, by not paying them to enter, it's that simple, guess people still dont understand how boycotts actually work
thats what pro china people wear tho cuz thats the colour of their flag
Absolutely - anything to get to their inner circle
Is that supposed to imply that I'm being paid by them? Again: pathetic and simplistic reasoning. Is it so hard to understand there is an independent opinion opposed to yours? And yes a small paycheck from Blizzard would probably allow me to survive a month, or probably much more than that. The typical Egyptian has very low income by your standards. Very classy of you to bring that up.
Wow everyone who is not of your opinion is paid, huh? Such a one sided way of thinking. Also, you are demonstrating exactly what I have been talking about in my original comment. My position regarding Blizzard's action says nothing about my opinion about the Hong Kong revolution and the Chinese oppression, just as I see that Blizzard's action does not say anything about their opinion on the matter. And what does my country's government have to do with me understanding what's happening in Hong Kong? We had our share of revolution and oppression too btw, and we still do. As for you however, I do not know.
That's a fair point. I retract my previous statement. Troll the shit out of that place.
I've got both and so does everyone else with a BlizzCon ticket. I'd like to enjoy the weekend, please.
I hope you're right. Have fun! this will be my first BlizzCon even though I've been a pretty hardcore fan for a long time.
Protest on the front gates then. And dont bring a red shirt, people will think you're pro-China or pro-comunism.
Oh ok. I was not aware of that
Ah, didn‚Äôt know that. My bad.
I heard they prefer the color black over red, so the color of the protesters is black. They even made a black version of the flag
E to examine

H to heal 

O to obey

N to negate

G to grenade

K to knife

O to overwatch

N to necessitate

G to grind
Blizzard will just fill the floor with people who work for them or actors paid to cheer. Best option is to be able to disrupt the live shows.
Oh please, they sold out. There are still enough fans willing to support the developer of their favorite games. Im by no means a shill or even a blizzard fan, but even i realize this loss is only temporary.
If everyone shows up in red shirts saying Free Hong Kong they won't be able to stream anything, which means their marketing investment won't have as much impact as it could have.  Then the media outlets and social media sites will be flooded with how they didn't stream the event due to the Red shirts, it would show censorship and possibly draw even more attention than if they were to stream it.  They've already got the ticket money, it's best to put your ticket to use as a vehicle for protest versus not showing up and them just replacing you with some random joe off the street to fill a seat.
this 1000 times
No, Blizzard livestreams Blizzcon as both a promotional tool for their games and a revenue generator 

As many protestors as possible need to make inside and get as much PRo Hong kong shit on camera as possible

This will force Blizzard to either cancell streams and censor Blizzcon entirely OR piss off the chinese 

The Virtual Ticket is huge for Blizzard in terms of not only making money but getting promotional material for their games out

We have a means of forcing them into choosing between dropping the virtual entirely and not streaming shit or pissing off the chinese
Actualy the best but cruel way is to go and put pressure on any blizzard employee which would make their job difficult which would stress them which would than trickle up and down cause pressure ,stress and issues at blizzard.

It's not fair but realisticly it's the best way to get result.
The best way to protest would be to go, sit down for the presentations and then when they start everyone just gets up and walks away.
Not going is a protest. Wearing the shirts is humiliation.
Or go in and mess up the streams by wearing/having pro HK stuff to get on their live streams. Force them to spend more to censor it or lose on their live stream or piss off the Chinese
If they won't stand up for what they believe in because of money, they'd fit right in at blizzard.
Usually.
Or people who openly advocate for private corporations like Blizzard or Disney to have complete freedom of what they do and put on their ToA all because right good left bad, always leading to scenarios where the consumers end up utterly subjugated.

When you seek to push a particular cause, it's worth studying the mechanics of [reactance](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/learning-work/201712/don-t-tread-me-psychological-reactance-omnipresent). Most people don't feel strongly one way or another unless you push them to, and when you do they rarely side with you.
3 weeks from now.

Honestly, enough time for the internet outraged cycle to move on 5 times over to something different.
What if I told you the people upset with EA would be a different group of people? If you are a huge blizzard fan, it's not like you are just going to forget about blizzard. 

I understand that the media spotlight will eventually shift from blizzard, but all that will remove are the people that don't pay attention to blizzard anyways. You'll still be left with fans of blizzard still unsure how to proceed with their hobby. 

It's not like you are going to get a collective "I guess mom isn't watching anymore, it's time to play WoW." Do you honestly need the complete attention of the world to boycott something? 

I don't think this sub is going to recover any time soon. Even after another controversy strikes. This place will be left a ghost town before it starts to get positive.
it's not sad  it's a legit strategy that most of the people in power employ.  the goal is to create so much horrible shit that it mentally exhausts you. 

I hope blizzard crashes in eu and na
I seriously doubt it. 

Don't you guys have phones? That was a while year ago. People will be going into blizzcon with THAT in their minds. This is definitely going to be super fresh, and just the fact that they are surrounded by blizzard will make people constantly think about it.

Forget?....maybe. Forgive? No.
I just really hope im wrong and people will continue to protest and dont forget about it. But no matter, this all is still very good for hong kong, they are full in the spotlight and making more and more people aware.
People will be going there with last year's scandal on their minds.

Three weeks, after a bigger one IMHO, is way too short.
There's nothing left for me to say.
Good luck, like I said, the security is tight.
Nobody's paying them additional money.  Tickets were sold out long ago and are non refundable.  Showing up doesn't give Blizzard money.  Staying away doesn't keep money out of Blizzard's hands.

I guess people could boycott by contesting the charges on their credit card, though that would technically be fraud.
But mah red shirt guy
It wasn't about you personally, just about you defending the company that wouldn't think twice before it exploits you and the situation you are forced to live in.

And yes, it was an implication that you're being paid by them, as I don't see why would anyone defend such a dick move they pulled. Then again I'm old enough to know that most of the people just turn a blind eye to the things that don't concern them directly. 

And I have to say I'm pretty glad to see that a lot of young people are taking their time to actually point a middle finger to someone who didn't wrong them directly, that's something a lot of boomers didn't count on when they went on their "divide and conquer" agenda.
That blizzard money must be good.
Also the blizzcon site says the tickets are non-refundable so people are feeling obligated to go. I second your idea.
Tickets were purchased, hotels reserved, and flights were booked 6 months ago.
Same for me, I‚Äôve been a fan since Warcraft II but never had the money to go, now I will :)
When it says free Hong Kong?
Right? Idk if they still scan Q&A questions but someone needs to do yet another embarrassing Q&A question about the situation. Especially in the Hearthstone Q&A if they have one. Maybe for Overwatch asking for a Hong Kong Mei skin
Maybe Chinese students rallied by the embassy.
Okay, so we coordinate JUST enough people to disrupt them so that way we can still get them to throw their money in the trash on actors just like we did with their games.
thats alot of money for nothing
If they mess up Blizzcon again I think they might finally be screwed. Here's hoping!
Wait is this satire?
[deleted]
I feel like making them spend more money is a good thing. It's another attack on their wallets.
DISRUPT THE LIVE SHOWS FTW
LUL bet they won't spend that sort of $$$
It would spin a completely different story in the news cycle than the one they want to tell.
That wouldnt do much, the best way like previously said above is to go in attire forcing you to be kicked out for your opinion or them censoring you.

If you leave that your choice, if they force you to leave that their choice and their choice speak mile above your.
Consumers are not subjugated. They have a choice to buy a product or not buy their product. Not buying their product would be the best choice.
inb4 implies im saying this before they do it. They certainly havent yet, but I can see them doing so with the amount of shit theyre gonna get at blizzcon
I know all that but I think this is big. The public can wait. It‚Äôs not like people are gonna beat up visitors.
Too big to crash for this kind of thing
Channel your inner photoshop power. It shouldn't be that hard
From far away people wont be able to read what's on the shirt.
The official government flag of Hong Kong has a red background, the protester flag has a black background in order to remove the Communist element.
Wont happen.  


Either no Q&A, or they moderate the questions *and* have someone in charge of reading them to prevent anything they cannot control.
i guess this year there will be no Q&A. It would be surprising to see coming from a bunch of cowards like blizzard

Maybe some kind of "staged" Q&A where paid shill will ask question that will make china and blizzard happy.
It's advertising.
No, this is known to happen at game conventions. E3 presentations often pack the first few rows with people they can guarantee to cheer during the stream.
Problem is that the people who did that weren't able to know this would happen, so their stuck with them.
They'd have to pay more for standard advertising.
People spend a lot of money to go to BlizzCon. And I mean A LOT of money. Take time off work, planning, etc. 

People go to BlizzCon to escape reality and politics.

Protesting is great, and it's anyone's right. But protest outside in front. Don't be an ass and be obnoxious inside, ruining other peoples' enjoyment and time and money. Be considerate.


Wear a pro-Hong Kong shirt. But no one wants some guy yelling out shit during panels etc.
don't get me wrong i still upvoted but i feel like its better if we're represented correctly
I mean it just needs enough people to yell something...you know like a slogan or something
every live stream panel, qa or event the crowd should chant pro hong kong stuff

force blizzard to cut streams to appease china and farther hurt their rep or take our side 

THey dont get to make money on virtual tickets this year if enough people force this shit on their cameras everytime they turn them on

Blizzard will have to again either not stream anything at all or censor us to appeause china

LOSE / LOSE for them
They can't control the audience if they star singing "do you hear the people sing"
They are going to heavily moderate the questions and likely have an intern or something read them
Even without all the botcott and Chinese censorship shit, I still think they would have moved forward with this approach after the whole 'out of season April Fools joke' comment and the overwhelming negative Diablo Immortal announcement.
Found the one sane person in the wild.
Thank you!
people neeed to be yelling shit at the cameras , on panels at QAs

Force Blizzard to choose broadcasting Blizzvcon or scrubbing it to appease China

Thats the best protest - they dont get to make money on virtual tickets this year



Force Blizzard to choose between Broadcasting Blizzcon and offending china or Censoring Us
Hell no. This protest is more important. Blizzard lost their right to any modicum of respect when they bowed down to China like this. Absolutely abhorrent.
A well-known one that‚Äôs around maybe eight words, perhaps.
If they put the stream on delay and cut it whenever something like that happens they're "safe".   
However, if they do that in the middle of them talking it'll be quite obvious, but most people will think it's a stream error.   


I'll have my popcorn ready when it's the day. I hope they make themselves heard, but it wont be easy.
Maybe don‚Äôt announce shit reskinned mobile games to a huge PC crowd and hype it like it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbig‚Äù Diablo announcement to a community who is starving for any good news for their franchise.
[deleted]
I‚Äôve got a catchy one that‚Äôs two words for afterwards
Do you guys really not have any smartphones?
Not if it constant. If it none stop they will have to cut the stream. The crowd should sing " do you hear the people sing"
I still enjoy the content they put out and support Hong Kong.... but if people want to be obnoxious assholes and ruin the experience, I and most other sane people are going to shift our displeasure from their actions to the people protesting and disrupting the experience. 

Make your presence known, but in a peaceful manner that doesn‚Äôt ruin the experience for those who want to enjoy the experience. The developers who are going there to present their work had no part in managements decision.
Protesters need to cause inconvenience  to amplify the message. Why do you think the protesters in Hong Kong were shutting  down airports and highways.
Ooh ooh I know, is it "You're banned"?
Hopefully that'll be the case. But it'll have to be planned.   


If only a few people speak I'm afraid they'll just be kicked out. This needs to be bigger than that.
