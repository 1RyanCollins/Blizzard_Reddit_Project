So that's how you get car stickers off. I've always been wondering about it...
I really love Overwatch. And Starcraft... And Warcraft... And Diablo... Activision is the worst piece of shit the game industry has seen.
Being an Overwatch fan, more than any other Blizzard game, watching this actually got me emotional... it was hard not to play OW anymore.


Fight on.
I also cancelled my WoW Classic.
Wet your windows first people!

Should have left the "over".
You should cross post this in /r/Overwatch. The mods over there are trying to censor anything Hong Kong related.

That link is radio segment of NPR (a major news outlet in the US) running a story about the Blitzchung controversy - the radio segment was shared on r/Overwatch. The r/Overwatch mods locked that thread and all of the comments, using the following comment as justification.

The problems of buying tat. The thing they endorse is bound to change.

Imagine if that wasn't even OP's car LULW
Destroying stuff is cool but remember, it's not giving them any more money that's important.
Nice gesture !
put a team fortress 2 one and you'll get em
Turns out it's not his car
Respect
This is the kind of stuff I wanna see.
I have this really nice Overwatch jacket that's super comfortable and definitely the nicest jacket I own, as well as a wallet that looks like a pack of Hearthstone cards that is my only wallet and it's perfect for how much stuff I have. I wish I could just toss/burn them but they're items I use every day (especially with it getting colder), and I can't rationalize destroying them. :/
Hell ya brother.
Very random, but I really love that shade of blue.
Wish what a chad he took off his overwatch sticker what a prophet
Plot twist, this isn't even his car. He's doing this to all cars
Dude taking his stickers off... you know shits got serious!
Reddit freedom fighters, brave to the last man.
That'll show'em
Low key, I‚Äôm worried that if we all boycott Blizzard that just grows the percentage of the player base that is Chinese and that would incentivize Blizzard to listen to China more.

Not an apologists, hate how they‚Äôve conceded their values, but that‚Äôs just an honest consequence.
Modern activism at its best, a guy filming himself scratching a sticker from his car's window. What a wonderful time to be alive.

That for sure will hurt China and Blizzard.

Edit : For anyone wondering, i support HK, that said, i do not want childrens talking about politics in games, i support the bann on Blitzchung and i don't blame Blizzard in any ways for that. So don't ask me what i'm doing against Blizzard, i don't want to hurt them for that.
Where do I get a sticker like that? Honest question.
Nice car OP
Lovely color
im impressed you did that one handed while filming without accidentally scratching your car, lol.
Careful, you can see your face in the reflection. Wouldn't want to damage your social score
What is it that he says at the end? I can't quite get it. Nice gesture by the way, the video transmits a strong feeling.
A small price to pay for democracy
Insert toy story ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt wanna play with you anymore‚Äô meme
What tool did you use to remove the sticker?
You showed them!
SO MUCH COURAGE ‚ù§Ô∏è
Is that Kim dot com or bald john Goodman? I can't tell
I must have missed some new scandal.....to think they would drive a man to remove a sticker from his car, scary.
r/blizzard mods sorting your sub's comment sections by controversial default now? Every bit as classy as I would have expected!
Some people are ripping on you for this here, but I applaud you. I've been a diehard OW fan since beta. Last night, I uninstalled, as well as cancelled my WoW subscription. I can deal with typical video game business BS practices (eg. lootboxes, expansions, pre-release specials), but this was too far. And their half-assed excuse for an apology only made this worse. 

You people ripping on this guy. You have to realize... OW was life for some of us. I loved this game, it was part of my routine. I loved the characters, the lore, the gameplay (despite it's huge balancing issues as of late). I been playing (almost) every day since beta. OW has been there for me through rough times, through the death of my mom last year. I always had this game, a place to escape. And now... it's tainted. It's like the Cosby Show. You can't watch that anymore knowing what Bill did. That's the one thing I can compare it to with my level of disgust.
Poor guy, I'm sorry that ended up being a waste of money.
Thank you for liberating Hong Kong. True American hero.
So brave!
I've got that sticker and Hanzo's Dragonstrike. Thanks for reminding me to scrape them off.
Guess it's Over~~Watch~~ between you and Blizzard now, huh?
Thanks man, I know it hurt but it was the right thing to do.
Wow so beautiful and brave
Im glad Blizzard didnt cause you to scratch your baby.
This man is a true hero, a conqueror of oppression all around the globe. Surely we should all remove our video game stickers from our rear windshields - that is the only real way of stopping the big bad communist China. /s
Who‚Äôs car you guys think this is?
Get a Team Fortress 2 sticker!
I thought he had a hammer for a sec and I thought he was just bust the window!üòÇ
I love you
Brave man
shame activision is such garbage, i was really enjoying classic wow
Shoulda just smashed the whole window.
It would be funny if it wasn‚Äôt his car
The state of that blade leaving scratches on your glass really bugs me
So brave
people with tattoos feeling the pressure right about now.
That wasn't his car though right?
Probably someone elses car hur hur
Man, that hurt to watch. Thank you for taking a stand.
Tip: Soak er down with some hot soapy water first. Helps it come off easier
I like to think this isn't OP's car. He just found an Overwatch sticker in a parking lot and did them a favor.
Hey Rick, how's the pawn shop?
Stunning and brave
Surprised the window didn't scratch, thought I'm sure you would've seen marks at a level 6 with deeper grooves at a level 7
Why is this sub defaulting to controversial sort
I really thought he was gonna smash his window
Should've set the car on fire at their HQ
*immediately signs into account when he gets home*
cringe to put it up there in the first place, cringe to record yourself taking it down
Did you throw your smart phone away too? It was made in a sweat shop
Should have replaced with a Hong Kong sticker
Blizzard getting hit hard and.. good!!
>Known as *‚ÄùThe Snowman‚Äù*, this serial sticky destroyer is lashing out at numerous victims across the tri-city area. Specifically targeting Blizzard stickers, the Snowman is still at large.
Man this comment section is a shit show
As bad as this whole shitstorm already was, they actually managed to make it worse with the news release earlier(friday evening).  Half-assed damage control with no actual apology, and a straight-up bold-faced lie about their motivations.
Bet this door handle feels that he has done something now
Putting a sticker from a videogame on your vehicle is cringey.
Just burn the car!
Well boys, we did it. Blizzard is no more.
Blizzard will loose some customers, but not nearly as many as if they stood up against China. Its all about the money.
Blizzard bad.
This comment section is...interesting...
... mine won't come off that easy... Issatattoo. After nearly 20 years of being a dedicated fan I figured it was a safe "I've loved them most my life. There is no way they'd disappoint me so much after all these years that I'd regret this."..... üò™
Can't believe how the tune has turned from yesterday to today on this subreddit. 
Where's the support? 

Are there so many Chinese agents here now?
*buys another overwatch sticker 2 hours later*
Filmed on a phone made in china, posted on an app owned by china.
Some people are being huge jerks. There is a point in posting this and doing what you did, it shows you care and it spreads awareness. 
We all have to do what we can to support real freedom and human rights even if its just a small first step.
That‚Äôll definitely teach them...
Don't let the haters  through, any act no matter how small is better than continuing to support any companies who bow to China.
This karma whoring is so cringy
Ah

This made me feel warm and fuzzy inside
Sweet ASMR
if you were really done with blizzard you would do that at the moment you found out about it , you shouldn't have waited to record it with your phone
Such an amazing sound that dull razer made all over your rear glass...
Should have left the "over".
I think it‚Äôs excellent China‚Äôs younger generation is taking a stand. But still just made a new character on Diablo.
This is the equivalent of someone changing their facebook picture to a picture of that country‚Äôs tragedy.
Should have kept OVER.
Future tip, use a blow dryer to melt the glue before peeling it off, less residue and chance of scratches!
thats how you remove car stickers???? :0
I thought this was going to be so dramatic, but then it was like, chipchipchipchip chip chip chip.
so brave, people in Hong Kong are safe now thanks to you, you really are the hero we deserve
imagine putting an overwatch sticker on your toy car in the first place. that video would be even more cringe than this one.
Bald people, no offense, are savages
I'm hoping that this was recorded on an iPhone : D
how brave of you, i bet that took so much effort to do, i mean you could have just done it and not posted it for points in a sub you know will give you points, you could quietly stop playing and only tell those you play way, but no those fake internet points will help out HK so much my hat off to you sir
Give you 5$ to smash the window in.
Best one yet
Wow so brave, truly inspiring.
This man has a life. cause he can stop playing Blizzard games.
This shit reminds me of when boomers were burning Keurigs and Nike's cancel your subscription and delete your account sure but the videos of people destroying merch I don't get.
I hope people start boycotting cod.
[Say the magic words.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Vyo4urabLw)
me uninstalling overwatch the other day
r/gifsthatendtoosoon
Am I a pos if I still play overwatch?
uninstalled bnet several days ago... think i'll stick with private servers for diablo II + expansion from now on.

i'm sure a game that old has *some* somewhere out there...
Time to start getting the blizzard game tattoos removed.
Oh wow, you removed a sticker you already paid for from your car, that'll sure teach Blizzard
It sucks because I honestly love overwatch, but Blizzard Activision is trash
You done good but hope you didn't scrape the paint of your car over this.
So brave! We did it plebbit!
I feel you bro. Wore my Blizzcon 10 lanyard for work for the last couple of years now. Had to throw that garbage in the trash and get a new one
[deleted]
Well boys, we did it. Corporate greed is no more!
What a hero
I'm so disappointed in blizzard.
You will be back like everyone else will!
Ladies and gentlemen, China is no more. Look at this brave soldier doing his part. Rise up gamers. üò§üò§
Difficult to overstate just how dumb this is
Cool.  Pick up Rainbow  6 Siege and enjoy.
r/oddlysatisfying
This is so cringe, dude you're going to scratch the shit out of your car!
Now put a TF2 one on top
Goo gone!
I've always wondered how that scraper doesn't scratch glass, is it metal edged?
I think this man right here just finished Blizzard. Maybe Bernie Sanders can win now? Trump is finished.
Who made that phone youre filming on? üòÇ thats right lmao
Amazing

You are a real hero

I'm sure people in Hong Kong will sleep soundly now

Really, what is the reason you uploaded this? Showing off how cool you are by getting rid of an Overwatch decal, which isn't really something anyone should be proud of owning in the first place?

Well at least you got Karma, Gold and 3 Silvers, so congrats. Kinda ironic that people keep gifting gold and silver around here even though Tencent owns some shares of Reddit too.
I'm as pissed as anyone but Jesus people, give it a week before you destroy your stuff
No one cares.
So brave..... good for you for jumping on that outrage culture bandwagon. 

When in fact the guy broke the code of conduct and got penalized for it. But hey, gotta follow the rest of the outrage sheep to stay cool and relevant. 

Prime example of what is wrong with people today. No self thought and quick to jump onto the latest outrage topic.
was going to make a retort to how silly this is.

Then I noticed the reflection.
Wow I bet they felt that
I mean... They already have your money, you even bought a sticker. Christ this is pathetic...
Good job how is this gonna affect them business wise? Like seriously why don‚Äôt you go out and protest against the ethics of what they are doing with siding with China who regularly breaks human rights and the other companies that side with China instead of posting on a subreddit which upvoted  a whatsboutism that people who are lgbtq+ is somehow breaking their rules?
Omg u are SO HANDSOME!!
How brave of you
Then some Rubbing Alcohol to get the glue off!
Heat guns actually work the best.
TIL
Using a rusty blade is also how you scratch the hell out of glass.
Nothings faster than a bad ass pressure washer
I‚Äôm with you. I‚Äôm a huge diablo fan. I own D3 on every platform available but I can‚Äôt bring myself to play it anymore over this.


I was really looking forward to playing Overwatch on Switch too.
I agree that Activision is scummy af but lets not hide our head in the sand here, Blizzard has changed as a company and share equal responsibility in this. 

It was Blizz's game, Blizz's tournament, Blizz's sanctions, and Blizz's grovelling apology to China. They own all of it from start to end.
I never thought I'd see the day, where I could plainly state "I've played an EA game today" without feeling a little dirty.
same here, overwatch was one of my favorite games until recently
Really a shame cause like blizzard they used to make really good games.
A company is only as good as the people that work for it. The passionate gamers who created Blizzard's legendary titles have left the company. There are still passionate gamers at Blizzard but obviously they are not in a position to make any difference.
Then it's doing its job. Everyone handles things differently. I totally understand. I gave 20 years of my life to blizzards games. But I also need to be able to sleep at night. I can't sit there clicking a mouse thinking about how they are a part of the mistreatment of people.
Right there with you man, I miss the shit out of Overwatch but it just wouldn't be the same even if I went back and played it. What would Reinhardt say? :(
My gf and i were playing o.w together every night  until this happened.

It does hurt.  I just got to diamond as hanzo. But our world is worth fighting for!

Fight on.
Not as good but theres still smite and paladins for the fix
Quick question, how is not playing ow bad for them if you already dont pay for any micro-transactions anyway?
Replayed OW after the situation and surprisingly didn‚Äôt give a shit, all that happened was that I remembered how fun the game is.
You already bought it, just don't buy lootboxes and take up server space.
Refund W3 preorder
wow.. so brave
i can haz all your gold?

^^^^^but ^^^^^srsly, ^^^^^that ^^^^^took ^^^^^guts. ^^^^^am ^^^^^proud ^^^^^of ^^^^^you!
Admirable!
(For anyone not aware, the wow devs, or really any devs, had literally nothing to do with the recent Blizzard acts against Blitzchung. By protesting in this way you are doing nothing but protesting the hard working and creative minds of blizzard employees who work to bring you these amazing game worlds. Be careful not to conflate this with the nasty corporate stuff.)
Congrats?
Second that!
LOL that would have been Epic!
I thought this too

Saying corporations "feel" systemic pressure to ignore human rights, or anything other than their bottom line is like saying water "feels" like flowing downhill, or objects thrown up in the air "feel" like falling back down. Focusing on profit above all else is an inherent quality of a free market economy, and is by design. Any consideration of an individual's rights is either coincidental, or done to avoid backlash that could negatively impact sales.
I agree and I hope that we can make some changes. At the same time I have a hard time blaming some of these people, I wouldn‚Äôt do this shit but, it‚Äôs hard to say no to billions of dollars. Plus, In line with what you said, if companies didn‚Äôt outsource work to different countries and did everything in the U.S, stuff would be more expensive and when people have to pay more for their stuff then we would see how many people actually care about ethics and morals. It‚Äôs a slippery slope, I hope if I were in a situation where I was making big decisions I could keep a level head and not focus solely on profits.
And this is why for a while I've stood opposed to the open stock market on the whole. To the point of outright refusing to partake in anything that involves it, in any capacity.
The economic system doesn't need to change. Our system makes it so companies are driven solely by profit, which makes it very simplistic to reward and punish certain business decisions. They are driven by profit because they need to be competitive, because markets inherit our values of democracy and freedom. 

Society needs to be able to agree upon some universal set of morals, despite the fact that we all have our differences, and be ready to take action in response to defend those morals, even if it means something as simple as not playing a particular video game. Being skeptical such as saying "why even bother, everyone is going to forget in a day or two", or not participating is what lets these companies continue to operate and do so without any incentive to change. Skeptics and cynics will always look for justifications as to not defend these morals mostly due to ignorance. After all, they continue to live here and benefit from them.
Thats why I cancled my WoW classic.
I requested an account deletion. Not only do I not wish to give them money I‚Äôd just assume trash what I have and scrub my info.
Better yet, Battleborn
Kind of the same with my overwatch razer headset. I really like it even if it's practically falling apart now.

Thankfully I didn't spend a dime for it. Got it from that Taco Bell promotion.
I don‚Äôt see any stickers here?

Taking DECALS off is always an emotional time.
This won't. But your comment will!
[deleted]
Right? Guarantee this dude did that. Went home. Thought about it and still fired up Overwatch.

But whatever get that karma boy
Per capita I think Western gamers spend more than Chinese gamers.
Well then it can become a company that make games for China, I'm sure there are companies out there that still want to make money from countries other than China, it's not like they don't make any money here at all, you gotta choose your target audience, and in most cases, you can't have everything.
Yeah, but staying put for that reason is a losing game. They've ALREADY declared China is more important than human rights. They aren't going to suddenly do a 180 and start treating their employees well, letting them actually have voices, etc.
What values have they conceded ? Did they unfairly force a rule? It happens to go with a view you agree with so what you aren‚Äôt allowed to bring that up in game chat . It‚Äôs not like the guy said something outside blizzard and got banned no but you guys acts that‚Äôs how it is like blizzard went after him for his opinion
I see it as more of a "Call To Arms" ;)
Public/Virtual/Viral acts like these expose more people, keep more people engaged or updated, and spread the message further. Any little bit helps!
better than you doing nothing and crying about it
Surely this asshole comment will do more.
Thank you comrade xi
You‚Äôre talking about it... clearly doing something
You're just trying to justify your own apathy.
That‚Äôs the thing with this society. You‚Äôre so stuck up in big results. That you don‚Äôt even know anymore that all little bits help. That doing what you can is good enough. But no, you think way too big. And that hinders you if doing anything at all. 

Keep the focus on your locus of control bro. And the rest will fall in its place eventually.
I mean he's boycotting blizzard..??
Just like the rednecks burning Nike and Keurigs.
It's not about hurting them. It's about not supporting them, the hurt part comes naturally although slowly.
What are you doing?
Right, so what did YOU do? At least he did that much.

Go on, it's a simple question. Answer it.

What did you do?
They can't handle the truth
I have the same views as yourself.
Everyone who responded to you is right, and you‚Äôre silly.
It's funny because you just typed a complaint about someone complaining, saying that scratching a sticker from a car window isn't enough, when all you did was touch your keyboard. What a moron.
I made it on a vynly cutter.
We should force blizzard to ignore the rule on the gamer because it‚Äôs a view we happen to agree with that makes sense . The rule should be 

‚Äú all political and religious views are banned from being said unless it‚Äôs a value Reddit Americans like then we ignore it ‚Äú
Hey now this isn't a roast thread! LOL
A husky middleaged bald guy with a beard standing up for China by filming himself with a Chinese made smartphone

Reddit is truly the smug neckhair of unrighteous protesting
It hides upvoted comments and the majority of upvotes are going to comments that are pro-HK.

Sorting by controversial gives someone the impression there are many, many more people that don‚Äôt think this is a big deal. What that does is, for people who may not know what‚Äôs going on or not have strong feelings, foment apathy or even garner support for Blizzard. 

It‚Äôs another PR stunt the mods are doing and it‚Äôs sad.
Did his smart phone aid in helping a government silence a human rights protest?

Oh weird guess it didn‚Äôt.
Hey I am a busy guy I  did this on my lunch break. can't do it after work it get dark to soon!
I have never used those point and don't plan on it. I honstely don't even know what they are for. I don't really post much.
Thanks, I'd like to thank /r blizzard thread for the courage it took to acomplish this. It wa such an emotional moment in my life I will never forget where i was when i did the thing that I did and I did it well so very well, well I guess I will go play so Apex Ledgens now......

Posted on reddit, the app owned by China
It is important to keep this conversation on going so it doesn't get forgotten instantly.
So any post that does that is doing good work.
imagine being this upset by this post, lol
All of this reddit fiasco is e-warriors circle jerking to their karma whoring. Purely about boosting their √©go. All ignorant about the actual situation, but who cares? Let's just all farm.karma and act like we care about people in Hong Kong. We're great!
If I was an overwatch fan I don't know if I could personally stomach keeping memorabilia that is basically an advertisement for their product, but also, I also wouldn't film myself destroying it. It's basically virtue signalling.

But also...Blizzard should know just how upset their fans are. But also...the people at Blizzard who made the decision probably don't give a single shit and would sooner move to China than appease fans in the west.
Thats how long you hold on to your ideals?
Nike is the best example here. These folks are statistically more likely to play a Blizzard product in a few months when the 'negative press' blows over
A lot of people care. People are allowed to protest anyway they wish. There are countries out there (China) where they don't have that right. Keep it up anyone who disagrees doesn't care about democracy. Now go play your games and pretend everything is ok in the world. Because after all, ignorance is bliss!
You do - otherwise you wouldn't be here.
I wonder if this guy will be embarrassed about this video in another 15 years.
If he had gotten in trouble for breaking code of conduct, that's fine.

But the punishment has to fit the crime. Kick him out of that tournament. Have him forfeit a couple of matches. Fine him. But a year's suspension, his prize money taken away, and posting about the glory and honor of China is all too much for what he did.
"Herr derr large group of people agree on something I disagree with must be sheep obviously."

Most people acknowledge he deserved some form of punishment however also believe the punishment was much too heavy handed.  Much more important to people than that even is their handling of the situation after that and their willingness to play both sides of the field with their phony PR statements.  Their recent statements and even the rule he violated do not line up with their supposed ideals and it's not even that hard to see.

Accusing people of not thinking and being sheep while blatantly ignoring their side of the argument might be one of the most intellectually hypocritical things possible.  Also counter outrage culture is no different than outrage culture itself I hope you can see that you are no different than the thing you are judging here.
Imagine being such a garbage person to the point where you insult someone‚Äôs appearance.
True, but I think maybe the premise is no more advertising... I dunno.
Those items are advertising the user purchases. While they do have the money from the same they won‚Äôt get any future revenue.
Wow... a short video about someone showing that he won't advertise for evil while tending their activities of daily living and you try to shame them for it.

What's wrong with You?  Not everyone can be on the front lines.  WARS ARE ALMOST NEVER WON ON THE FRONT LINES.  What he is doing is small, but it takes MILLIONS of small actions in order to hit them where it hurts.  He is doing what he can, and you never know, he could be encouraging many others to do what they can.

Shame on you for trying to shame him.
In my experience WD-40 works best
Safer to use a razor blade (a plastic one for removing decals from paint).
Then some normal alcohol to forget that a once popular software company are now prepared to support the imprisonment, murder and organ theft from teenagers to suck up to their chinese masters.
Rub some Aloe Vera on it.
You should wet the surface before scraping. It will help prevent scratches from any dirt thats on the surface.
Shit*
I agree however I did want to run a cord out there!
Be careful with heat guns on glass I've seen them shattered from too much heat
You can't scratch glass with a typical blade (e.g. steel or iron).
This is what we use at work, with a temp set at like 180F
Maybe switch to poe instead of d3? I like it better anyways.
Blizzards board is to blame but the actual employees started walking out because of what they did
Where's the proof of this claim?
>The passionate gamers who created Blizzard's legendary titles have left the company.

There are a lot of old employees in Blizzard. For instance, Jeff Kaplan is in Blizzard since 2002, working as a designer first for World of Warcraft and now being the lead designer of Overwatch.
100%. 

Thankfully I have Bethesda to carry me through, and Warframe and No Mans Sky.

Ill miss Overwatch and Moira... I was starting to do well. But this is easily more important
LMAOOOO
Thats like saying you cant wear a Nike t-shirt because the workers that make them earn 1p an hour.
stocks, if a game loses its playerbase investors won't back it up anymore and it will lose stock power, so yeah, not playing the game hurts them more than paying or not paying the initial price of the game
Oh snap I need to do that also!
[deleted]
It‚Äôs not about playing the game it‚Äôs about not giving them money
Not really, I was having fun playing, but I can really only show my support of Hong Kong by not giving them my money. I guess I could write a strongly worded letter.....
One question: What do you do about saving for retirement?  My options are through company matching Simple IRA, and Roth IRA which use the stock market through index funds?
hahaha

the stock market is the most empowering economic system ever conceived

the biggest, most important companies in our economy, owned entirely by the general public. 

the biggest, most important companies in our economy, owned entirely by millions of people.

an abundance of economic and social mobility... and you idiots want to burn it down
I hate to break it to you but in the thousands of years of recorded human history, mankind has NEVER been able to agree on morals. That's not going to suddenly change because China's swinging its dick around and suddenly gamers noticed, despite them doing it for the past ten years.
There ya go
I'll be honest here. I dont have the balls for a full deletion
nah i dont think thats good
Okay I‚Äôm way too gay to understand the difference between a sticker and a decal?

How are they different? Genuine question.
Thoughts and prayers!
Remember, if you don‚Äôt immediately get the end result yourself you better do nothing.
China‚Äôs is actually already larger, mostly because they don‚Äôt have the same stigma on ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù games or buying addons like mounts or skins.

This is apparent as the next Diablo is going to be mobile to appeal to Chinese gamers and supposedly it was leaked that most of WOWs player base is actually Chinese. the WOW store even had a purchase exclusive Chinese style dog mount, way after MOP, so it‚Äôs hardly subtle.
> Did they unfairly force a rule

yes actually, if there wasn't political motivation to their rule enforcement they would have also banned the College team who held up a protest sign live on stream from competition, instead they were given their next match in the tournament.
Advocating for freedom against a fascist regime should not be offensive to no one but fascists. Blizzard‚Äôs values don‚Äôt include the rights of people.
See this is the apologist
Someone bought you silver for that instead of donating it to an appropriate charity.  Now thats funny.
are you doin anything about it except making a gain from people's temporary hatred to blizzard
Is it though
Most likely just about as much.
With this logic, I‚Äôm doing something right now that will eventually lead to Christina Hendrix walking into my bedroom and giving me a rim job.

Destroying your own private property that you've already paid for to own the Chinese government like a boss.
[deleted]
TBH it's good he commented, otherwise we'd all assume everyone understands why these little acts are important.

It's actually a great opportunity to share high quality thought.
[deleted]
Lol so you didn't even give Blizzard money for it? You basically just shit on your own product.  


Way to show em! /s
"Made" in this context means manufacturing, that's because of chinese sweat shops, the workers get paid jack shit for manufacturing the phones so businesses naturally contract them instead of paying a higher price for the same outcome. (in other words, contracting companies who actually pay their workers decently)

You really said a lot without knowing much about why so many products are made in china in the first place.
You‚Äôre so far up your ass. Do you feel like a hero yet?
sorry if my comment was offensive
I doubt anyone would buy Overwatch just because they saw someone with an Overwatch car sticker
Anyone who thinks taking off a bumper sticker doesn‚Äôt destroy the Chinese government must be a Chinese shill okay cool
Entire reddit is full of circlejerks about the situation. This one does nothing except for stroking his ego.
Thoughts and prayers.
What did Nike do? The Colin thing?
I hope you have stopped using *everything* that is china related in your life.
You clearly dont understand what care actually means then lmao. So jaded.
I'm sorry, who made you the punishment court?

Who determines the punishment? Oh, that was Blizzard, not some yahoo on Reddit. 

People world still be whinging no matter what the punishment was. No where have Blizzard stayed that they support China. This is just a fallacy propagated by the outrage culture.
[removed]
imagine being such a garbage person to the point where you judge an entire person by one reddit comment.
I didn‚Äôt insult his appearance. You did.
I am not shaming I am saying there is a lot more to do rather than destroying a sticker.
also works good!
A blowtorch is a lot quicker.

Sure, I concede, you might need some polish (or a new car) afterwards.
Funny story... WD-40 is the ONLY thing that will remove crayons from an LCD screen.

i.e. I took a nap around a toddler 10 years ago and learned this the hard way.
Found the engineer.
Just be careful with your cars‚Äô clear coat! WD-40 and iso are both solvents
Lacquer thinner is nice for it too
Goo gone also works pretty well.
WD-40 works on almost everything related to metals
Heat guns are no joke I melted the carpet trying to get some wax out. Thought it would be faster than using a iron.
Yes you can, especially if it‚Äôs rusty.
PoE is fully owned by Tencent.
Ten cen owns 40% of fortnite. Fortnite is owned and published by Epic. Epic made a statement saying they will not censor anyone for their beliefs. Ten cen owns 5% of blizzard I believe. Can you explain why they are okay with Epic‚Äôs statement but they‚Äôd strong arm Blizzard?
I tried it and I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan.
Warframe is also a good option. 

Almost always in top 10 steam games for 5 years. Game devs are located in canada and compamy was taken over by a firm based in hong kong. It operates a lot on the mainland as well but has always been kinda sceptical to china and often does things less appriciated by china.
There isn‚Äôt any. I‚Äôm not even a blizzard shill but I started researching this because it‚Äôs interesting to me. Turns out money probably wasn‚Äôt the reason behind it like everyone assumes it was. everything I‚Äôve gathered points to them basically trying to distance themselves from being a politica platform. They essentially had a gun pointed at them and had to pick which loved one was going to die. If someone can prove me otherwise then I‚Äôll gladly read
Indeed. We live in a time where the consumer has multiple options at any given time. All the more reason companies need to think about their customers and people. They need us more than we need them.
That's the thing, it's hard to give up on Overwatch when you've got barely any other games to play. The only similar title I play is Rainbow 6 Siege which sometimes simply tilts me and then I'm just stuck to being bored out of my mind.
Warframe is a good game. Its what got me to stop playing fortnite stw and eventually battle royale.
Ah, thanks a lot for explaining to my dumby brain
As Cartman said "When you pre-order a game you're just committing to paying for something some assholes in California haven't finished working on yet. You know what you get for pre-ordering a game? A big dick in your mouth."
Wube is.

Boycotts dont tend to work. This is just looking to damage the good side of blizzard.
Same position here. I was really enjoying the Classic grind. Oh well. If Blizz reconsiders their stance on HK I'm back in an instant.
Or if you enjoy playing then play, I am
Because it's incredibly flawed. You argue that these companies are owned entirely by the general public, but practically speaking the actual ownership and control falls under a comparatively tiny group of people.

People whose sole jobs it is to go around investing in companies to make shitloads of money.

People who *already had a lot of money to begin with*.

You see the problem here?

If it really was as simple as 'every company owned by the general public', we wouldn't be having this conversation. These companies do not serve the general public. They serve their shareholders. And themselves. That's it.

I don't like being cynical, but to think buying stock as a single person, or even as a large group of people, actually makes a meaningful difference in reality, when all the control still lies in the hands of a few people, who can just force their way in whenever they want, and give no shits about anyone else unless it makes them more money? That's naive *at best*.
Well maybe it's time, because we live in an age where you can get your message across to someone else in mere seconds and where we're all connected. There has never been a better point in time.

How exactly are you going to impose a change on the economic system without contradicting the idea of freedom? Everything you do is dictated by some sort of economic motivation. Relying on a businesses to uphold morals is naive and is what led to this situation in the first place.
I figure at this point I‚Äôve had my fill of the games I bought anyway and it‚Äôll be one less potential data breech.
tbh, you got a ton of other games you can play, and you could also spend that time doing something to improve yourself, there are a lot of other options, that not playing a game anymore is really not something that hard to do once you start thinking about it, of course, if you want to.
I believe it‚Äôs about how the image is being attached to the thing that you are decorating. When I think of a sticker, I think of an image that is printed onto one whole piece of plastic that is then stuck onto the item. Whereas with a decal (like for car windows) it can often come in many different pieces that require precision to place together properly, so if you‚Äôre not careful when attaching the decal it may not line up properly.

I could also be totally wrong, too, I‚Äôm not a professional so take this explanation with a grain of salt.
They are both just stickers. One just goes on a car
One is a sticker, the other is a decal. That's how I usually tell.
Are you weenies prepared to boycott Disney too?
But this literally does nothing. It‚Äôs not about giving up because you didn‚Äôt get far enough. It‚Äôs about doing something that is actually going to move you at all towards making a difference.
Don‚Äôt play that card . You guys were upset before that 


they didn‚Äôt do anything because  you guys make such a big deal about them fairly enforcing a rule  and PRESSURE them to pick what not to ban instead of just enforcing the rule by the booms they start to not be able to enforce that because if they banned them you cry babies would cry more

that‚Äôs facts
Bootlickers everywhere in this thread.
Sheep
lmao right
You know people don't have to buy coins right? I got platinum once so I had enough for one gold and two silvers (coincidentally, the same that that comment has), and I didn't spend a thing
and what charities have you donated to?
Its keeping the topic alive, and in the minds of our lawmakers as important to voters, so yeah probably
It is.
It's not
Blizzard just caved already. How much does China pay you per hour?
This only holds water if you have politicians and representatives who are willing to push legislation to get christina hendrix to rim you, based on populus support. 

Large numbers of people considering blizzards support of china over hong kong as an issue is already resulting in politicians making comments and taking it into consideration. 

I dont think there is a single representative who gives a shit if you get rimmed. Sorry mate
She‚Äôs more likely now than ever.  Good job!
I don‚Äôt know...personally I think it‚Äôs pretty petty to tell someone that they‚Äôre not making difference. They‚Äôre standing up for something they believe in. Criticizing them for they‚Äôre decision to do so is doing the exact opposite. OP‚Äôs doing every option available to him/her to make a statement.
I don't see what the edit has to do with my comment, or your original one for that matter.
Your edit means nothing. Keep whining though
> Destroying your own private property that you've already paid for to own the Chinese government like a boss.

Better than sitting back, doing nothing, continuing to swallow what they feed you, and keep paying for it like their servant.
>Edit : For anyone wondering, i support HK, that said, i do not want childrens talking about politics in games, i support the bann on Blitzchung and i don't blame Blizzard in any ways for that. So don't ask me what i'm doing against Blizzard, i don't want to hurt them for that.

So basically, you have no answer, not even something as 'inconsequential' as scraping a sticker off your own car window and having the guts to post it online.

Pardon my disbelief in your amazing valor and courage.
My point still stands even if you're a pro-censorship, "i do not want childrens talking about politics in games" is not a valid statement, you still typed your complaint with your keyboard and it's literally no better than him scratching a blizzard sticker off his car.
As opposed to destroying something when they already have the money?
lol what? he is taking away his public advertisement for them. why would he leave that on there after this? and why does it bother you that he posted it?
You're right, you should pay them money for something to destroy instead.  That'll truly show them. /s
Correct.

That is the meaning of the word ‚Äúmade‚Äù.
[deleted] LOL
I‚Äôm sure some do!
Reposts and upvotes.
Thoughts and prayers do nothing. How about you actually go there and fight side by side with the protesters? :\^)
Indeed. When Colin's commercial debuted, everybody "burned their sneakers" in protest to the terrible company doing terrible things to their terrible workers in that terrible country.

https://www.vox.com/2018/9/4/17818148/nike-boycott-kaepernick

But I guess what nobody figured is that these boycotts don't really last too long and the stock prices went up shortly after people forgot about that. Because you know, Nike got free exposure for months from idiots.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NKE/history/

>Nike surged as much as 9.2% in early U.S. trading after its second-quarter results soared past projections, particularly in its two most important regions: North America and Greater China...The earnings report was Nike‚Äôs first to include the impact of its controversial ad campaign featuring quarterback-turned-activist Colin Kaepernick. The inclusion of Kaepernick in the line of ‚ÄúJust Do It‚Äù ads initially rankled investors, though they eventually applauded the move. Parker has said that the ads drove an uptick in traffic and engagement.

Don't forget, this also happened to Keurig when they basically said "Roy Moore is a disgusting pedophile" and Fox News went "No he's not" and all the Fox News fans broke their Keurigs in protest.

https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/keurig-boycott

Guess whose stock prices also coincidentally rose?

If you're breaking an item you personally bought in protest of a company and their actions, not only are you out the object you destroyed (shoes, coffee maker, whatever) but you're statistically more likely to repurchase that item once the hype dies.
Looks like you care as well
> I'm sorry, who made you the punishment court?

> Who determines the punishment? Oh, that was Blizzard, not some yahoo on Reddit.

Considering this is the biggest controversy in Gaming this year, and it's actually caused Blizzard Employees to *stage a walk out*, it's pretty clear that "some yahoo on Reddit" isn't the only one thinking this was over the line.
Responding to your comments in order.  First your response is almost as long as mine so I guess try not to exert yourself to much as well although it really doesn't take much effort to type things.  Second I responded to the one argument you seemed to provide so I certainly didn't ignore it.  Please feel free to correct me if I missed an argument in your first post.  Third I also looked at the situation from my own point of view which I outlined in the post above and came to a different conclusion than you it just so happens that in this case my views align with a majority of people's but that doesn't mean I didn't come to that conclusion myself.  And finally you accuse me of first agreeing with a majority of people and then follow up by saying I can't be seen agreeing with someone because that would look bad.  I even said I agree with you in my first post that he did deserve some form of punishment so clearly I can agree.
Calling someone a garbage person isn‚Äôt an insult to appearance, it‚Äôs an insult to someone‚Äôs character.
And not everyone is capable of performing every single thing that needs to be done.  But the bottom line is that he took a step in the right direction.  What is the purpose of trying to make him feel bad about it?
So does a hammer
A few pounds of C4 also works.
Many, many a night I craved some Polish.
NO NO NO NO.
What about playdoe?
Grim Dawn is pretty good and not chinese owned i think

also wolcen but its still in early access beta
The only thing I can say in PoE's "defense", on that front, is that at least it is completely and openly Chinese-owned. It's not an American company with only its toe in the water, still kowtowing to the Chinese in hopes they'll throw it some scraps. If GGG pulled some shit like what Blizzard did, they'd at least have the fallback of literally legally having to do that. 

Blizzard has no excuse at all.
Reddit is 20% owned by TenCent
Try [Grim Dawn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/219990/Grim_Dawn/) instead.
Tencent doesn't fully own GGG. They only own 80% with the potential to own more in the future. Might see it as splitting hairs. But, still...
So far GGG hasn't done anything China support-y that I know of. I hope it doesn't come to that cause poe is my favorite game and I don't want to have to stop
To be fair, Epic's feet haven't been put to the fire in that regard.  Only if they end up in a situation like this will we find out if Tim Sweeney is talking out his ass or really means it.

That being said, I fully believe if Tencent is going to do this with a company they own 5% of, they sure as hell are going to try it with a company they own 2/5 of.
I don't think Blizzard even waited to see if Tencent would give them an ultimatum.  They reacted so quickly it was as if they were thirsting for the opportunity to prove how loyal they are to the Chinese regime.
Blizzard wants the chinese mobile market
Uh they had LGBT politics in their games, so they definitely have a political platform
I picked up csgo gun game for the time being lol
If youre looking for another hero shooter, you might try Paladins. Its not as polished as OW but its got alot of character and its free. Ive been really enjoying it in my down time from siege
Well, there is Palladins, I heard it's similar, I've played for about a hour, and it's ok, has heroes, card system...
...and there is TF2. It has a massive community, it's also class based, there are hats, friendlies, taunts, custom maps, random crits, fan animations, community servers and much more. The downside is that it's not that similar.
To be honest, I've never played Overwatch, so I can't really relate, but both of these games are free, so it won't hurt giving them a try.

And yes, I'm a TF2 player, but I think you should check out Palladins first, because the style of characters isn't that different, and if you're looking a replacement, not an alternative, that's your best shot.
Or watch "Meet the team" shorts. You'll see the style, the characters, that's what got me in this game... and meet the amazing pyro, this fan animation is gold.
Im only MR7 but I have a bunch of prime stuff.  That game on a 1440p/144hz is beautiful.

Nyx Prime and Loki :)
Go on‚Ä¶
Praise Geraldo
I was feeling that way, but this extended silence with no comment (to us, anyway) has shown me how little respect or even care Blizzard has for its player base.

If you look at the history of their responses to customer feedback about their questionable decisions, the response has always been "No, you're wrong.  We're right.  Just wait, you'll see how wrong you are," (e.g. "Don't you guys have phones?" instead of "Wow, we really thought our PC-dedicated playerbase would like this," puts the blame squarely on the players for failing Blizzard, not the other way around).  They've built up this extreme arrogance and disdain for their players, and it's really showing in the way they're basically ghosting American players because they're so sure that we'll all come crawling back at the next shiny event with new opportunities to give them money.  Why bother apologizing if you think your fans are just drooling idiots?  They'll be back either way.

They're holding up the people too addicted and locked into their games to care about anything else as "proof" that they're right, rather than looking at why people might be upset.  I have no intention of going back to a company that treats me like dog shit because it thinks I am dog shit.

And I'm really hoping that one day I have the emotional fortitude to stand firmly behind that and delete my accounts, because all I've had so far is cancelling a sub, getting a WCIII refund, and deleting the games and Battlenet from my hard drive.
You can't see any reasons people might choose not to do something they'd otherwise want to do?

A company provides a good or a service to the general public. They work to increase their market share and scale, trying to reach the greatest number of those in the general public as possible to maximum returns for their shareholders. If the general public stops using their good or service, their revenue drops and returns will drop for investors, making it less likely for them to continue to invest and for future potential investors to do so. The company will continue to run on what remaining money it has left until it goes bankrupt and ceases to exist.

Now the company is obviously controlled by those who buy into it. Anyone can see that. But there is also the idea that you and everyone else that can purchase their goods or services, controls them by dictating whether or not they continue to exist.
Oof. That's some pie in the sky ideas right there. The only way to have moral agreement is to force it, and the pursuit of utopia has been the excuse behind much of the evils of the twentieth and twenty first centuries.
If you think they ACTUALLY delete your info then you are foolish. You‚Äôre personal info is way to valuable to delete. They will just store it for now and sell it later, if they aren‚Äôt already selling it.
I've recently dedicated my time to learning Cubase and producing music again. You're totally right. There are much more productive things I should be doing with my time. I appreciate the positivity and wish you luck brotha.
Thank you... so decals are stickers on cars in multi parts. So still stickers?

So it‚Äôs like all decals are stickers but not all stickers are decals. I can understand that. Still think that leaves me with that decals are fundamentally multi part car stickers.

I feel like original ‚Äúactually those are decals‚Äù dude, has led me astray into thinking decals were some massively different thing. *shakes fist*
Thank you kindly although I feel I have been led astray by the original ‚Äúactually it‚Äôs a decal‚Äù, guy. 

Here was me hoping to find out some butch bloke car knowledge, I could impress my brother with and now I‚Äôm left with ‚Äústickers are stickers and decals are stickers that go on cars.‚Äù 

Oh well... suppose I‚Äôm gonna be boring my bro with ‚Äústrictly come dancing‚Äù chat again, on Sunday.
Like I‚Äôm sure that sounded snazzy, but I‚Äôm no further forward with my question.

Do you want to try again or are you sticking with just rephrasing the question, in the hopes it gets you ‚Äúcool‚Äù points?
Yes.
Was that comment made assuming that boycotting Disney would be difficult? Lol
Yeah because US representatives are surfing reddit all day reading about neck beards jumping on the next hot thing to get their panties in a bunch this week. What China is doing is absolutely shitty but this type of shit is about as useful as a shit flavored lollipop.
This has the same affect as people burning their Nike shoes. Which is none.
Woosh

Only the so called biggest controversy because morons like you are making a big deal out of it.
No I knew that.

I meant , I wasn‚Äôt insulting his appearance.
I've been thinking, and I've come to the following conclusion:

Hammers and blowtorches might be a little excessive. An angle grinder, however... that might do the trick!
Or a belt sander.
And my axe!
I like to use my personal satellite that blast laser beams from orbit.
I played Grim Dawn in GOG. It's pure love and DRM-free.
You mean like Epic who is almost 50% owned by Tencent? I've played a lot of games owned by Tencent, people don't like to plaster their name everywhere because they're just in it for the money (Tencent).
But they know not to censor the /r/HongKong stuff, because if nothing else people would be pissed. It's possible to sell a non-majority portion of stock to someone and not let them undermine the values of a company - maybe Blizz could learn something from reddit.
5% IIRC not 20%.
Tencent has helped the Chinese government spy on people by allowing malware be installed with their software. Which is way worse than anything blizzard ever did. By playing PoE you support that company.
I didn‚Äôt play it much but I was surprised that the game had undead, skeletons etc. 

It didn‚Äôt come across like it had been neutered for Chinese audiences. If anything it was a bit too grim in places!
But they didn‚Äôt. That statement epic put out sets a potentially dangerous precedent for ten cen‚Äôs support of China. It doesn‚Äôt add up and supports the theory that none of this blizzard situation is directly involved with money and more on image and future representation.
You don‚Äôt need a fire before a company‚Äôs shareholders will want to put it out: that‚Äôs why corporations have so many lawyers.
It doesn‚Äôt make sense that epic would be allowed to put that statement out without ten cen shutting that shit down shortly after.
Companies do not wait for fires to start. They do their best to prevent it from ever starting. This is a case where I don‚Äôt think ever considered this and now they are dealing with it to prevent future cases of this
That‚Äôs so wild to even say. Listen to yourself. That‚Äôs some MAGA level shit
I wish our existence wasn‚Äôt inherently political
What do you even mean with that comment? I can‚Äôt even begin to rationalize it
Considering him getting banned had nothing to do with Hong Kong, no I don't get it
How am I trash for enjoying a game?
No one every said that, wtf is wrong with you
Where are you getting this idea of enforcement from? I'm simply saying that everyone needs to be able to hold themselves responsible and for those that feel they don't is the flaw that needs fixing, because of the fact that we live in a democracy and our markets reflect that, give us the power to also hold immoral businesses accountable, despite how cynical things may appear. And on a global scale, humanity at least can agree that we shouldn't kill each other, so clearly mankind can agree on some things.
I mean, if I wanted "cool" points I imagine I'd go with something other than a glorified dad joke, so... no, I think I'll stick with that.
[Um, buddy?](https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/policy/international/464990-lawmakers-criticize-blizzard-for-suspending-gamer-who-supported-hong%3famp)
except he literally made it himself and its sole purpose is to be an advertisement. so its literally nothing like burning a shoe.
Morons like the staff of Blizzard, who made the games you're defending as well, evidently.
Sure kiddo.
Better use industrial strength acid
Epic's playing a weird game right now, with Tim Sweeney speaking out against Blizzard while also having Chinese hands in his pockets.  I guess the best defense I can give Epic is that they're so gratuitously evil in such gross and overt ways that them being an arm of the CCP can't even damage their image.
They still let china invest and therefore profit from them, which just strengthens china.
Well idk I saw 20%
Hardly.  I've got family who've worked with businesses trying to break into the Chinese market, and it requires *years* of negotiations and strategic gifts to even be licensed to operate by the government, much less expand.  Blizzard's been pushing hard to get a foothold over there and it makes total sense that they'd be in panic mode if there was even a hint of that being threatened.

I'm not sure what's MAGA about that?  It involves actual knowledge of other cultures and how they operate.
Sadly, that's on Blizzard and other companies for using it as such.
They made many pro LGBT statements and supported that platform in their products, which is a political platform.  This disproves your point of them not doing that.

I'm not saying it's wrong, just pointing out their hypocrisy.
Tell yourself whatever you have to, little buddy.
Why are you a liar? Your parents were failures if they didn't teach you not to lie
[removed]
Just pointing out the flaw in your logic. 

You enjoy supporting Chinese government, go nuts.
You instantly looked to the mans appearance.

I was talking about the phone.

It‚Äôs made in china.
I just use a nuke.
I'm inclined to agree.
We still talking about a car or Blizz .admin and Commie censors?
No I‚Äôm saying how you are able to just assume such a wild fantasy with nothing to back it up. There‚Äôs already hard evidence that this isn‚Äôt about money and more about image. Yeah it certainly could hurt their Chinese division. But there‚Äôs a much bigger picture here that people are choosing to ignore. I feel like you should see that since it sounds like you come from a business background just as my family does. Their global image is at stake now and it‚Äôs not because of the boycotting. If you can‚Äôt see that then I really do advise you look more into it. This is much bigger than the Chinese market at this point and I‚Äôm not talking about the western market
Are you saying the comments made directly from blizzards staff? The statements that were confirmed by a board? Was blitz part of this decision process or did he just excerise his right while taking blizzards away? Whether you like it or not, blitz doing this on a blizzard stream is making it political but not by their decision. There‚Äôs a huge difference and I‚Äôm honestly not sure how you can‚Äôt see that. I support LBGT but I don‚Äôt have to announce that unless I want to right? Have you considered how different it is to support LGBT and to support foreign affairs? Have you considered how different those two things are when it‚Äôs comingfrom a corporate environment? You‚Äôre still thinking from your own perspective. So is most of this sub. Taking his prize money was a little much. Everything else is fine. You need to set up a standard if you don‚Äôt want people to keep doing stuff like this.
It was courageous but also very misguided by doing this on a blizzard platform.
By your logic, blizzard should have never come out and supported anything because now it‚Äôs a requirement that they allow support on their platform that isn‚Äôt directly themselves saying it. So by your logic, it‚Äôs safer to keep your mouth shut which is pretty ironic. I‚Äôm outtie. This community is a bunch of morons
Supporting LGBT people isnt political, it's just being a good human.
Hence why I'm saying the truth
He broke the tournament rules, and was punished in line with what was in the rules he agreed to when he signed up, are you dense? Or just don't read and go with everything you hear?
What do you mean by "you people"?
Not supporting the Chinese government in any way
Proof?
From orbit, just to be sure.
Or maybe some of that shit Xi puts in the Uyghurs‚Äò water supply.
Yes?
But it HAS been polticized.

Preventing people from being murdered for protesting is being a good human too, but guess what? It's been politicized and Blizzard chose money over the people being brutalized. That's how the world is.
I don‚Äôt think truth means what you think it means. 

Enjoy your cognitive dissonance though.
Chinese apologists are first against the wall
Ok what about the Chinese cheaters in 2018 who were given a slap on the wrist and even brought back for all-star international ? https://dotesports.com/hearthstone/news/hearthstone-community-torn-over-cheaters-at-all-star-invitational


You know if the guy was just given a slap on the wrist it wouldn‚Äôt have been so bad but they came down on this guy hard, like it‚Äôs hard to not see it as a political statement from Blizzard
>and was punished in line with what was in the rules

A year, taking all his winnings, and **firing the two commentators on screen when he spoke**?? The rules you read in mainland China are obviously different than the ones we got in English.
 **Indifference** is not a response. **Indifference** is not a beginning, it is an end. And, therefore, **indifference is always the friend of the enemy**, for it benefits the aggressor -- never his victim, whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten.
You said your piece to instigate drama. You didn't need to respond to this post. But you just HAD to. Move on bro, go read things you enjoy. Contribute actual things to conversations. "Congrats?" Was a dick move.
It‚Äôs in the pudding
Oh I get it, but supporting LGBT people SHOULDN'T be political, it's a  neutral thing that is neither positive nor negative. Oh well at least I can boycott blizzard.
They didn‚Äôt do that though. You‚Äôve fooled yourself. How much have you actually researched?
Who in here is a chinese apologist? I am backing blizzard, not China
I've never heard of that incident, but it doesn't negate the fact that he broke the rules and was punished
No the ban was different and extreme,  the casters were literally separate, and the winnings were in the rules
Did I ever once say I didn't dislike the Chinese government or that I like what they do? No, didn't think so
And this post didn't need to exist, this fake anger over china is sad and doesnt need to exist either
about what I expected
Right, what they're saying is neither should supporting the people of Hong Kong
[deleted]
Blizzard's backing China.  Guilty by association.
Yeah and Blizzard didn‚Äôt have to come down on him that hard, by doing so it‚Äôs really appeared to cement their political stance against saying things that would upset the Chinese government. 


It‚Äôs not just the players haven‚Äôt you seen the Blizzard employees protesting as well?
Words and actions are very different things.
Just because you don't care doesn't meanothers are faking it. Even if they are? Why do you give a shit? 

You just wanted to come in here and be edgy. We get it. Very brave. No go log onto wow and understand thats where your morals lie.
Good debate. Appreciate you admitting you‚Äôre wrong
They really aren't though...
Ok, if you dislike China so much, get rid of your phone, your car, the clothes you wear, hell stop using reddit honestly. Otherwise you are no better
You do know it wasn't the protest that got him banned but breaking the contract, right?
Yeah, they really are.
My phone isn't from China. My car is European. My clothes are all American made, and Tencent owns a 40% share in Reddit and as far as I can tell Reddit isn't removing my pro-Hong Kong posts and comments, so I think I'm good. Your logic is hot garbage anyways, that's like saying you shouldn't try to eat any healthy foods if you don't plan on eating exclusively healthy food.
No shit. Does that make it right?
Show me a statement issued by them that backs this claim
What phone do you have and what car and clothes do you have?
It was literally in the contract he signed and the rules for the tournament.  So yea kinda does. Heavy-handed punishment? Sure, but he signed up knowing what the punishment would be
...the banning of Blitzchung and subsequent apology to China..?
Maybe you should look at this https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfkmp1/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/
Moto X and a Subaru.
Okay, Blizzard participate in gay rights activities.
That website is edited by china so it very well could have been made more china friendly.. and his banning was for breaking a rule he agreed to
That website is quite often edited by china to be more friendly to them.... not a source
So China and nothing
And? That was random
Whatever helps you sleep at night.
Motorola is an American company and the Moto X is manufactured in the US. Almost all Subaru's are made in Japan, with the only exception being some assemblies in the US. idk what you're on.
If Blizzard are allowed to pick and choose which political standpoints are and arent alllowed, they can get fucked. Your inability to join dots is quite impressive.
Drink soup
So maybe kudos to you but made in America doesn't mean American parts,  also Google owns Motorola so yea good luck with that
Well with minimal information to even know where you were going with that.

And fair enough,  so anyone should be able to use a tournament interview and blizzard's platform to say any political stance they have at will? That what you are saying?
Correct. *especially* if they are advocating for freedom.
Ok, so what happens when a klansman gets on there and spews his horrid views? You'd have to be ok with it and not punish him too
Correct, you dont have to punish people for dumb views, but you can condem them or at least say you dont agree and they dont reflect your views. Its pretty simple. What you want is censorship so you dont hear scary views. Hearing opposing views is good, it helps you maintain or develop your own.
No what I'm for is the appropriate use of a platform, blizzard's tournament is not an appropriate Avenue for politics of any kind
Lol, so what about the Gay rights and other political events Blizzard participate in? Weve already worked out that Blizzard are happy to use their platform for politics.

Are you against them being involved in gay rights activities?
I don't care honestly, it's their platform. If he had permission thatd be one thing, but he didn't
So you are for censorship. got it.
That's not censorship....
Only allowing certain views to be spoken and other views punished?

Hmmm.
It would be, if he didn't agree to the rules and then broke them, it's punishment for breaking a rule, not censorship
