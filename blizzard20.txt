I wouldn't mind Activision-Blizzard's higher ups having to be locked in a room with this annoyance
Iâ€™m glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your familyâ€™s organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
Fuck the dictator fuck the Chinese government fuck Beijing

As someone from r/freefolk and r/oldfreefolk, they fucked up more than D&D did with GoT season 8
OOTL what happened?

This would be great if a ton of people did this in front of wherever the ceoâ€™s were
Yeah might not be so easy to ignore something that is not just a numbers on a paper
and forced to watch Season 8
#hijacking your comment to say: If you or anyone you know plans on deleting their account, don't just delete your account! You can request your Data from Blizzard and if they dont follow trhough within 30 days they have to pay hefty fines inside the EU. If everyone does this, they might have such an enormous backlog and will have to pay up.

Hearthstone player voiced his support for Hong Kong's liberation on a livestream, got his prize money revoked and banned from tournaments for a year.

Livestream hosts (who ducked under their table in an "oh crap" moment after he said it) have also been let go.
Oof. Damning.
One for the extra shame
Dude we shouldnâ€™t fall to there level. torture is immoral
Wow that's majorly fucked. I hope Blizzard chokes on that chinese dick its sucking.
Big facts
Cruel AND unusual.
Like, it's not just the fact that they banned the player, but they came down so hard they *also punished the streamers*. That's some "shoot the messenger" shit.
