Blizzard burning in flames, very fitting
Army here. Trashed my shit too, fuck them
Navy here. Did you piss on it afterwards?
Reddit is censoring my posts so ill put er in here. PSA if you live in the EU you have a right to request your personal data from dpo@blizzard.com! Do so!
Semper, Devil

Love,

Doc
Army vet here, thank you for your cervix debbled egg. I wonder if their Chinese market will be able to recoup not having a market anywhere else

edit: someone informed me i made a type, so i will fix it
sadly no physical copies to burn

Cancelled WOW subscription
Uninstalled WOW Classic
Uninstalled WOW
Uninstalled Overwatch

Thank you for serving our country and fighting for Americans of all races and creed. The fact that this American company is siding with the CCP and suppressing freedom of speech is beyond horrific.
Not from us am an Australian actually, but wanted to say thank you for fighting for your country
Destruction can be beautiful sometimes
The hardest decisions require the strongest wills.
Both your service and this are appreciated
American exceptionalism is a myth, the modern US mil fights against freedom not for it. Don't blind yourselves to what happened in Vietnam and Iraq. Look at the Highway of Death in the Gulf War, and tell me it was for justice; you will find yourself just as deceived as a PRC bot.
I support you fully, but I just want to make sure you know that burning the money you already spent doesn't actually hurt Blizzard. Still, the imagery is strong.
Wow, I had no idea that there were WW2 vets that were such avid video gamers. You must be a WW2 vet because no soldier since then has fought for my freedom against a threat, they've only fought for the oligarchy's profits.
Thank you!!
Fuck ya!
As a fellow veteran, I would join with you, but I already quit playing their games years ago. The actiblizz culture of shoveling out shit to sell microtransactions killed their reputation for me. Every year just reaffirms that I made the correct decision.
Sorry but what will this do? You already bought them. Blizzard has its money. 

Also buy burning the games you take away the mere chance that blizz will actually go and CHANGE.
You sir are quite a comedian. Since when US military fights for freedom (last time they did was WW2)?
But but but ... You already gave them your money. Now you are just destroying your own property which for me is kinda stupid
So have you actually done anything to help Hong Kong after posting this virtue signalling bandwagon garbage or are you just going to pretend that somehow burning boxes of Blizzard games helps anyone? You know, donated to help the cause, wrote to politicians that sort of thing?

By the way, post the aftermath. Prove this isn't photoshopped.
They already got your money dumbass
Hahaha, US marine fighting for "freedom". Keep deluding yourself, you were a pawn doing menial tasks.
'Freedom'
Fighting for freedom. Sure, bud!
aS a PrIoR uS mArInE
So you burned something you paid for that was yours. Blizzard had your money already, how does this show them?
You fought in WW2? I hope I can still game while I'm that old.
I didn't know freedom equated to killing innocent pine nut farmers
I hope that fire didn't melt all your Crayola! We need you strong out there, yes I'm Navy ( Total PoG)
Literally adding fuel to the fire.

&#x200B;

Good job!
I didn't think there was such a thing as prior Marines.
Brilliant
Horrah
The fire looks great, what were your camera settings?
Who cares?! It‚Äôs not like they are anti freedom. I‚Äôve seen the video and I cringe so hard after. You can make a point, but wear a T-shirt or do something subtle if you want to raise awareness for something. Wearing a mask and screaming like an idiot is just cringe AF, while many people are watching. 

He took a chance to see how far he can go on a spot like that and it didn‚Äôt work out for his gaming career. Shit happens. He might made his point to raise awareness, so I say it‚Äôs a solid 50/50. Stop being stupid by blaming Blizzard to take sides, while they actually didn‚Äôt take any side and promoted a neutral position.
The professional gamer they fired broke ToS 



Reevaluate the situation after checking facts if you actually care and aren't a fuckwombling karmawhore
A Marine ?

You didn't fight for freedom you clown, you fought for imperial causes and all your presidents are war criminals that should stay the rest of their lifes on jail.
Remind me, which of our recent wars were fought on behalf of freedom?
Thank you for your service.
I agree what they did was messed up but....... I don't think it's necessary to burn everything.....
Awesome guys. Love capitalism burning blizzard.
So happy I stopped playing OW 5 weeks ago, and will NEVER PLAY A BLIZZARD GAME AGAN.
Where my Air Force at *im not but just asking*
lol **US Marine**  Great!
salute from the HongKong. Blizzard will not be tolerated.
salute!
Thanks for fighting for my freedoms in california
Respect. Uninstalled all Blizzard games on my PC. Won't burn my tower though...
Would be nice if I could trash my OW shit too. Too bad my parents won't let me make a firepit in the backyard.
Blizzard all about that #SuckDongForYuan.
>Arthas funko

I'm proud son
Good job. I would do the same.
A lot of Chinese bots in this thread.
I am a Hongkoner and appreciate deeply to your action. Thank you US. Fight for freedom!
You guys are awesome! Thank you for your service.
Is this in reaction to Hong Kong events?
Tweet this at em plz
Honestly what is this about? Because this is incredible confusing?
Salute
Respect
I mean, that's cool, but they're still on your [battle.net](https://battle.net) account.
I stopped playing OW for more then a year. And I will never buy new game from them.
I kinda want to buy a used Blizzard gear just so I can do this.
Blizzard has been circling the drain for a while.
It's a beautiful picture, even without context
Where did you exactly fight for freedom? Mr. Ex Marine? Did you fight for the freedom of your own country inside your own country? No? I didn't think so. Stop the propaganda bullshit and better keep your mouth shut. We all know how America "fights for freedom" on other continents, in other countries.
I think its quite funny actually, people are angry because blizz is enforcing the punishment on him for breaking the rules.

Blizzard would 100% not have done this if he did it on his own stream or anywhere else where blizzard would not have been mentioned, reason for the ban is he did it on a blizzard sponsored stream which lead to the ban and so on.

It even says in the COC "removal from grandmaster, prize money reduced to 0 usd and a pro league ban". 

Knowing this he still did it and what do you know he got punished for it, and still people are boycotting blizzard for following their own rules.

Im not going to cancel my subscriptions or burn my physical copies and shirts because what blizzard did was not wrong, what he did was.
Not sure "prior" is very American. I smell BS (on top of all that burning plastic).
Oh no an angry army man. That will teach them.
What is it with Americans and burning products they own?

I'm not against the symbolism. Just seems like an oddly consistent American thing to do.
Taking crayon eating to a whole new level I see.
that really wasn't necessary. this is the equivalent of burning books because the publisher is an asshole, or your house to oppose your government. the only one you are hurting is yourself.
Blizzard finally joins Diablo in hell
Why not burn some books while you're on it. I bet no bad person ever in the history of the world burned books...oh wait.
"for freedom", or for oil? please don't be stupid thinking us is way better than china please
Hate to break it to you, but if you indeed served in the US armed forces you were most likely not fighting for freedom.
Did you burn your IPhone too after you took the picture?
What is wrong with people?? This action by Blizzard does not say they  support China against Hong Kong, it just says they do not permit  politics in gaming venues which is absolutely understandable. If they  allowed one instance, they will need to allow all - a pro chinese gamer  spewing stuff about Hong Kong too, some Israeli guy about Palestine and  vice versa, Trump haters, etc... Next thing you know their tournaments  would be a venue for polarizing political statements. I'm sure all this  controversy is because that particular political issue was against most  of what the western players uphold, but if it was an issue they agreed  with they would have totally understood the decision... I'm saddened to  see the west not upholding their own values and being unable to separate  emotions from sound judgement. Really pathetic and saddening. Blizzard  does not deserve all this hate for a sound decision based on a contract,  for a very perfectly reasonable reasoning. People seem to be dying to be in a situation to be self righteous, such people probably do not enjoy anything anyway... shame... Oh and before anyone says I'm from China or something - I'm Egyptian.
Photoshopped you can tell
I shot brown kids for freedom and used it for karma, upvotes to the left please üò§
Same fire pit where you burned your nikes? üòÇ
You don‚Äôt seem to mind US activity in Yemen though... do you honestly care about human rights?
Fought for... which freedom? Certainly not mine. What does being a marine have to do with this at all?
Good job brother.We must stand up to authoritarian regimes and attempts to impose it on our freedom
American politicians bought and paid for over the last 50 years. Income equality, affordable healthcare and affordable education being stripped away but this is what everyone is losing their shit over.. ?
Cringe
I personally have never met a marine who referred to themselves as a ‚Äúformer‚Äù marine. And also this photo looks super fake
This post is *very* cringy for two reason:

1. "Marine... Fought for freedom".

2. Burning shit to protest against the company whose games you had already bought and paid for. This is a lose-lose situation.
Thank you for your service in the war of 1812, sir. What was Andrew Jackson like in person?
Although I support your stance....unfortunately they already took your money. =\[ Best way would probably deleting accounts and hurt their wallet.
Hahahahahah xd people rly think that destroying their own stuff and cancelling wow subs help ? In what world are you guys living?
killing illiterate goat herders is not "fighting for freedom"
wow they really brainwashed you lol. you actually believe you fought for our freedom? thanks for taking over those oil fields and dirt huts, cant thank you enough
US marine fighting for freedom? You were fighting for american hegemony. You never had a war where you had to defend your home.
You can't hear and see anything which you don't want. What's the difference between Chinese and Americans? We are all brainwashed, but by different power.
Thank you for everything you‚Äôve done for us
Is that an iPhone? Oh, wait you should throw your bullets in there because they're made with that Chinese invention, gunpowder.
Wait lol how old are you if you fought in a war to protect American freedom? Just curious.
Navy here; meritorious conduct, marine.
This makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.
Your response is more powerful, I just uninstalled all my games. Back to Steam and the Nintendo Switch for all my gaming needs.
Prior marine? No one says prior marine. Once a marine always a marine. Unless OTH.

Edit: OTH means other than honorable discharge.
Fuck Blizzard and Fuck China!
Don't make me laugh, US military fight for freedom? No, you fight for oils and hegemony
was this taken in your off time between bombing innocent civilians in random country A and random country B?
There's nothing smart about this. All you're doing is just burning your property. You already paid for it, this just makes you look stupid lol. On top of that, you're just burning...nothing really since all those games are on your bnet account and don't need the boxes for anything. Show us deleting your shit. Not burning useless boxes.

Like all those idiots burning up their Nike shoes. Company already got paid, you just ruined your own property.

You eat too many Crayons?
how did you fight for freedom?
Mega boot farming karma in multiple subreddits, these internet points are damn tasty arent they
POST PICS OF YOUR BANNED BATTLENET ACCOUNT IF YOU ARE REALLY SERIOUS
Thank you for you service. Sadly I don't have any hard copies of any of the games or I would be doing this as well. Honestly fuck blizzard. I uninstalled everything from my system. They want to support communism on American soil they can go move there.
I'm proud
lol I love the message but I'm cracking up over here at how over-the-top some of these posts are
military are very dramatic
Plot twist: they were all empty boxes.
I r average redditor company bad I attack American company for I am angry at China. Downvote all differing opinions rawr
Fuxk the chinese government
Great!
You are good man, thank you
Lol Idc about Blizzard and I'm not about to start, but you're still burning YOUR property for karma.
The flame effects look so real!
Thank you, sir. I agree we should not support these disgusting companies! Such greed is not okay.
Idk if it will really touch them if you burn those shit you already bought it ...
Hahaha
Giving Blizzard the rest of the week to make this right before I uninstall my Blizzard games which I've been playing since I was a kid. I'm a grandmaster in HOTS, many times diamond in SC2, and played the hell out of Diablo 2 the original StarCraft, and even the mediocre Diablo 3. Corporations need to understand that morality matters. 

They won't get a single dollar or iota of support from me until they make this right. They need to:

1. Issue a strong statement in support of real free speech.

2. Remove all penalties from the Hearthstone player in question.

3. Apologize for their moral lapse. Freedom, democracy, and free speech must always be stood up for.
You did show them by burning all this plastic in this day and age, that you already bought off them...
 can someone explain the situation i‚Äôm really out of the loop
That hurts
Eat shit bootlicker
Not disregarding the action here but that diablo box in the fire looks like a solid commercial pic
Thank you for your service!!!
It's the Nike shoes all over again.
Your infantry brother up in the cold north, ditched my shit as well. Stay safe. Thank you for your service. Bravo Zulu!
I‚Äôm out of the loop, what‚Äôs the deal with everyone hating blizzard I don‚Äôt get it. Not like I play any of their games anyways, but still
"you're welcome for my service"
Boycott those cowards
US soldier fought for freedom. OK.
Very brave
wtf are you like 100 years old
No such thing as a former Marine. oorah!
I would just like to say this is now showing up under "HOT" that is all.
Oh wow TYFYS
Man they really fucked up didnt they? I bet they werent expecting this backlash. Funny, their justification for the ban is "we dont do politics over here" but the ban proves that they infact actually do politics. Ironic. They should have just closed their eyes on this one.
I deleted my blizzard account after seeing your post.
You burned your boxes!!! How about what is in the cloud? hahaha... I'm on to you.
Lmao so dramatic.
What freedom did you achieve?
I only did this figuratively.. it was a little sad- but necessary.
Respect
looks fake
Whose freedom did you fight for, and when?
Damn, I could never do that, you‚Äôre brave
As a fellow prior service Marine, stop waving your DD214 foe brownie points. Your drill instructors would cringe seeing this post.
They haven't had a product worth buying since D2 LOD, honestly.
And they will enjoy your money just as much as you will all this begged for attention "LOOK AT ME I MARINE I KISS BOOT FOR A LIVING hAHa"
Delete all your blizzard accounts. Delete all the digital copies. Quit their games.
If this were happening in your city you'd be shooting the protesters
This is photoshopped
But didn't you fck up others freedom by serving the military?

One man's freedom fighter us another man's terrorist
Just a question why you all mention your Army ranks when it doesnt even have something to do with the Blizzard Incident. Flex much?
US fought for freedom? Ahahahahah whatever bro
Not an american but I fully support this, that's an MVP act right there. ggwp.
you already paid for those games tho
Marine as well here, right there with you brother. #boycottblizzard
Just requested a refund for Warcraft 3. Was looking forward to it but it's just a game.
I‚Äôve NEVER heard a Marine refer to himself as a ‚Äúprior‚Äù Marine. They always say ‚Äúformer Marine‚Äù. Also ‚Äúwho fought for freedom‚Äù, is this r/justbootthings ?
Give them to me instead of burning them
A lot of that shit looks awfully unscathed for being in a blazing fire.  I sympathise with the message though.
good thing you didn't burn any of any of their good games (Warcraft 2-3, Starcraft, Diablo 2)
Wow !Man you did a great job.
I don't like how people are deleting their accounts and burning their games. I hate blizzard as much as the next guy but i have progress on their games, and i don't want to lose my stuff. Still tho i hate blizzard
see you in 8.3 lol
I love the image, but this is equivalent to Michael Scott crumbling up a dollar bill and saying it was totally destroyed.
Army here: All accounts deleted.
Yeah but everything is digital download now...so are you going to burn the pc too lol.
\+1M to Blizzard's Carma. Way to go, Blizzard
You mean Israel
Salute  
The world needs more people like you
I did the same thing. Good riddance.
Dude you are US marine, you arent really better than them
back in late 2008 after finding out what's Tencent was, I knew this would happened and it did happened. I just uninstalled all blizz game. now the damn problem is I pre-ordered the W3 remastered :I
Spoiler alert its just a box he kept the discs
What happend with Blizzard?
Different continent, probably different world view here, but we‚Äôre on the same page today. Just did the same thing by deleting my account with many associated games.
From an active zoomie, thanks for your service mang.
Lmao
You have the balls, i wouldnt be able to do it with something i have so many memories with.

&#x200B;

Bravo OP
Semper Fi
What did blizzard do?
Thank you for your service.  


I stand with Hong Kong
I'm boycotting Blizzard now. If anyone thinks I'll change my mind, I'll just mention that I'm also boycotting French wine. 

As most of the readers here probably wasn't even born yet when this boycott started, I'll leave this link:

https://www.independent.co.uk/news/french-wine-boycott-successful-1317133.html
New titles i can agree, but i wouldnt thrash my W3 and original WoW cases. Those were made by different company and different people. Blizzard Activision is just a name for something else. RIP blizzard.
The boxes and wood don't actually appear to be burning tho, looks like Photoshop.
You are never a "prior" Marine. You ARE a Marine.
Oh yes, need to show tuis big companies we dont need them
Looks like Blizzard needs to learn what Semper Fidelis really means.
That will certainly help Hongkong
Proud of you my friend. The world stands against China and its bloodthirsty regime.
a grampa being fascinated with video games its quite rare indeed! thank you for your service soldier!
Why would you burn good games over a companies shitty decision
Woah
That is a gangsta move not gonna lie. Respect.
Almost everybody I know in the military used blizzard games as an easy way to hang out or stay in contact with friends.  I can't believe it's come to this.
Bruh moment when all your games are digital and you can't do something cool like that
Good job guys.  Keep it up.  I lay awake at night worrying if people really have enough fear over the implications of Blizzard‚Äôs actions here and what it could mean if it doesn‚Äôt go unpunished.  Other companies that have a vested interest in the Chinese economy are watching closely.  Totalitarianism doesn‚Äôt happen overnight.  It‚Äôs a slow process that sneaks up on a society and before you realize it‚Äôs happened, it‚Äôs already too late.
Burning them is a bit much IMO. Sell it on to at least recoup SOME of the losses. It's what I'm doing with my PS4 copy of Overwatch
Good shit man, I got rid of all of my blizzard games from diablo 2 onwards. We need to keep it up! What Blizzard and the chinese government are doing is wrong.
True military decisiveness. Devil Dogs!
Whose freedom did you fight for? Not America's, if you went into another country to kill other people in their homes and towns. That's just called invasion.
Who is ever a *former Marine...
You mean a marine fighting for you freedom.
This is 100% photoshopped.
This is inspiring and should be posted on r/pics r/gaming and anywhere else it won't be taken down
As long as you activated the keys on [Battle.net](https://Battle.net), you don't need to physical copies right..?
Nice photoshop you got there. Easy to cash in when people‚Äôs emotions are high, you sick bastard.
Why are people trashing/burning the retail packaging?
You already paid for it tho
I enjoy the message and appreciate it, but anyone else think this looks like a bad photoshop job? Flames too perfect.. No charring on ANYTHING... No smoke.
This is fake
Altough it's not ok what Blizzard did I wouldn't burn my Games. I mean...I paid for it, it's not worth burning it because they already got the money. It shows the anger, but doesn't effect anything to boycott Blizzard.
So if you try burning your WoW CDs and the flame goes out on disc 4 do you have to start the fire all over again with disc 1?
This looks photo shopped.  Have another angle?
Just to let you know, some /r/Gamingcirclejerk jerkoff took your post and is [claiming it for their own](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/comments/dfp8iz/as_a_prior_us_marine_who_fought_for_freedom_your/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share).

EDIT: And others are spamming your post there to mock you.
Wow, that's really impressive that you did it.
Thank you for your service Marine!
Rahhh! YUT YUT!
Thank you for your service. We must all stand up for what is morally right. The core fundamental value that binds us as a nation is freedom. Remember that people in Hong Kong and mainland China are still suffering from oppression.
Thank you for your service, brother.
Respect

o7 I salute you
First: Thank you for your service,

Second: I get canceling subscriptions (which is warranted) but I never saw a point in destroying one's own property.

By all means, its your stuff do as you please but it only comes across as a virtue signal to me.
Never served personally but I have friends and family who have served. Thank you.
thank you for your service
Thank you for your service and your fighting for freedom!
Thanks for your service.
Thank you for your service.
How dare you blizzard! Bending over for communism??!  How awesome would it be to create games with complete artistic freedom of expression? Oh wait you can because you're based in countries that FOUGHT and DIED for that freedom!!!!! And you give in to communist China???? Disgusting! Move to China if you love an enslaved demographic so much! You spit in freedoms face!
More importantly, Thank you for your service. ‚úäüèº
My respect for our military grows every day.
Lol, so pathetic. It's like the fight between Napster and Metallica back in the early 2000s.
How did killing children protect anyone's freedoms? I don't see how dying for Isreal helped anyone. Unless you were in World War 2. Anything past that you just helped tyranny.
Oorah!
Respect!

Badass!! I tip my hat to you, sir. Thank you for your service.
Did you throw away your phone too? I can bet it was made in China.
Lol you still have all those codes on your computer all you did was burn cardboard...
It hurts looking at this since I loved Diablo 1 and 2. I want blizzard north back

What war did you fight in?

You Navy guys and your fetishes.

Only live, or all citizens?

I'm a dual of Murica and Germany, but I live in Murica
Will they respond for people not living in Europe/not European citizens? Would love to know what info they have on me.
why can't i do this in canada :(
You mean China is censoring your posts.
Thank you for your what?!?
This is amazing.
Honestly i doubt they will lose everybody. Sure, a loss is a loss, but there are still the people who just want to play wow or overwatch.
Lol, if you actually think that many people care you're delusional. The vast majority don't even know about this or give a shit.   


It will blow over by Blizzcon like most of these sorts of stories. Blizzard are a business and their market in China was at stake, to think they'd choose another option here is silly.  


And I say that as someone who has been disappointed in recent Blizzard products.
Hey man!! Leave classic wow out of this.
Not by me
By whom?
This is far from the only American company bent on suppressing freedom of speech.

Of course, that doesn‚Äôt make them any less shitty.
>fighting for Americans of all races and creed

The Detroit Race Riots say hello.
I had no idea that people in HK were one of those Americans of all races. Boy, that was a shocker.
Came here looking for this comment, thanks. The US invasion of foreign countries is what creates terrorism. When the US bombs civilians, destroying their homes and killing their families, these people have nothing left to live for and want to avenge the wrongful deaths of their people. While most US soldiers are good people who want to help the world, they're mislead and lied to by the US government. They're used as pawns to further the interests of US private companies that profit from the military industrial complex and the economic damage that war causes.
Right? Now let's thank them for it
Objectivity in these affairs is not for those who fight. The hero and freedom myths of the military class and others are propagated for certain reasons favorable to rulers and the populace. Onward brave souls!
I'm sure the Viets love having a totalitarian one-party system which brutally oppresses their right to free speech. Fighting against the violent, hegemonic Communist regime in Vietnam was textbook "freedom-fighting." Look at the insanely brutal crackdowns and purges conducted by the NV after the war. That regime is essentially indefensible by anyone with a moral compass, and they contributed heavily to the nearly hundred million killed by Communism. 

America is factually exceptional in many ways. Military power, economic power, political sway, all are unrivaled by any other single nation, and you really can't argue that.
I cant hear you over the sounds of your organs being harvested.
Regardless of whether or not you're right, most men who enlist have their hearts in the right place. You commenting this here is as pointless as it is tonedeaf.
>	burning the money you already spent doesn‚Äôt actually hurt Blizzard.


Sharing his message does
I think the intent is to remove your attachment towards the company, its like burning your 5 years worth of collection basically.

Its like people that perma deleted their account, its way harder to come back after you deleted years and years of progress.
AND we're in an age where a box just has a download code, he can get these right back on his PC at no cost anytime.
They fought for an ideal. Dont like an oligarchy. Blame and dispose of them. Soldiers typically join because they want to better the country and its values. The soldiers represent the people in its fierce fighting heart. If you are such a coward to let them stay in power then sit down, at least those men and women fight for an ideal, waiting for the civilian public to put a government in power they can be proud of. Shame on you
You are absolutely right my man.
Just because the US picks conflicts that are beneficial to the US doesn't mean the US can't also prosecute wars which are also beneficial to world freedom and prosperity.  


I think people are often confused by the fact that the US chooses to fight wars which are both profitable to its interests and supportive of freedom.   


Obviously, it would be much more noble to take part in wars which do not benefit it but benefit others, but I think it is still commendable that the US actively chooses to not engage in conflicts which only benefit its interests and do not promote freedom and democracy. If it wanted to, the US could use its military might to secure many more benefits for itself if it wanted, but refrains from doing so for the sake of long term profits and the greater good.
Oh look, it's a naive child throwing rocks.

How was Korea a war for the oligarchs? Do you buy gasoline? Maybe you could donate a bunch of money to Saddam Husseins family with the money you saved on gasoline. Because shit doesn't stay cheap unless someone is making sure it gets here.

Except you're probably 16 years old and have no idea what I'm talking about.
WoW costs monthly.

Also if they CHANGE in capital letters and the people responsible are gone you can still reward them by buying all their stuff again.
Didnt the U.S. call every war they are involved with as "fight for freedom" since 9/11?
Found the communist.
He got Reddit karma out of it, so... win?
And what have you done if i might ask?
It's supposed to be an expression of his opinion about the situation.
Wow is free to play now?
fOuGhT fOr FrEeDoM
You would be better off giving it away to someone that was going to buy a copy to deny a sale
It shows the severing of a relationship
Would've been better if he sold it. That way it lowers the market value and people don't buy it new anymore. 

Burning it doesn't do shit, you're just throwing your own money away, and Blizzard doesn't give 2 shits.
It‚Äôs not about money, it‚Äôs about sending a message.
It's burning a bridge.
Its about sending a message
He's a Marine you can't expect complex thinking
What makes you think Blizzard doesn't want more money from people who love them? It's more expensive to acquire new customers than sell to those that already buy your products.

This man clearly showed the end of his love and money for Blizzard.

Also there's WoW in the pile, which is a monthly subscription and i think Overwatch has lootboxes? No idea if you can buy them by money though. Still one less player in a multiplayer-game dependent on opponents being available.
It's not to show them anything. It's for karma. 

Yes, the actions taken were dumb.
Imaging caring so much you write a whole paragraph about your opinion
Bootlicker
Even if he did, the response to it was banning him and taking his prize money? A little over the top don't you think?

I looked up what the ToS Violation was:
Engaging in any act that, in Blizzard‚Äôs sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image will result in removal from Grandmasters and reduction of the player‚Äôs prize total to $0 USD, in addition to other remedies which may be provided for under the Handbook and Blizzard‚Äôs Website Terms. 

So basically Blizzard is stating in plain English: Talking about the human right's violations in Hong Kong is damaging to Blizzard. Way to be Blizzard! /s
Too bad Blizzard's ToS are crap if they go against the idea of free speech. Why don't you reevaluate your principles, ya commie.
But fire is fun!
Some people have principles, others do not...
There really is, some of them are so low effort its almost insulting.
Not bots. Likely real people paid to do what bots do.

They're actually way cheaper than coding functional bots. Coding functional bots costs money to hire people that are more likely going to leave or do something more profitable in another country or a legitimate company.
Blizzard banned and took away prize money of blitzchung a pro hearthstone player for basically saying that he supports hong kong
That's because *our* military's primary purpose is to fight against the enemies of our own people, not against our own people.

I wonder what it's like knowing that your training and skills are more likely to be used against your own countrymen than those from another continent or country. Does it fill one with pride?
It was done at blizzards discretion. They made the choice to act.

If you're lucky enough to live in a democracy respect that people died on their feet so you don't have to live on your knees.
\+ 10 social credits to you!
Attention
It's funny how blizzard is evil enough to destroy products for, but not Apple, Google, or any major tech or entertainment company that provides business to China with censorship
Seems like you would fit in China just right. Maybe move there?
And fake because nothing is even slightly blackened. Such virtue signaling without any balls behind, pathetic.
I guess in a free world.
If you think destroying your game or canceling your sub is pointless...

Try destroying a blizzard game before buying it, or asking blizzard if you can play without paying subscription. 

And they will explain it themselves how big of a deal it realy is.
The one in which I might know my individual actions probably won't change huge company's decisions... but at least I get to follow my own moral code. Supporting companies that are fine with mass genocide and Hitler level cruelty (and in fact indirectly fund this to happen, 5% of Activision Blizzard is effectively Chinese) is a tiiiiiiny bit beyond that.
You mean like in 2010 when they decided WoW forums were going to force users to show real names?

And when people pointed out the obvious stupidity of the policy were told it was a done deal and not changing?

Only for Blizzard to rapidly backtrack over the next few days after tens of thousands of us cancelled WoW subscriptions?

Unfortunately, a lot of people that enlist, ESPECIALLY boots, and even some that return from deployments, truly believe they're fighting in a war for "freedom". It's crazy how people will call out China for their brainwashing, yet...

Catering to a customer is capitalism. This has nothing to do with communism.
Please look into actual communism. Communism is a stateless and moneyless society. If china was Communist, there would be no money to be made there and no reason for blizzard to do business (capital) there. There would also be no authoritarian state. Everything blizzard is doing is on behalf of their profits (capital) and their shareholders interests (capital), aka capitalism.
Plot twist. You only need to redeem the codes. Everything else in the box is useless.
Was looking for this, the boxes don't even look burnt
PSA: please stop doing this. All military personnel who actually did any lick of anything hate being thanked for their "service". People like OP didn't do a damn thing, that's why they still latch onto it years later to try and milk any bit of attention they can out of it. It's disgusting to the rest and the most uncomfortable thing anyone can tell a former military person.
Just the DIs? Nay, ALL OTHER Marines cringe at these posts ..
WoW Vanilla, TBC and Wrath were all great.

All your presidents are war criminals your country has brought nothing but death, dictatorships and terrorism to other parts of the world
This is just like the hindemburg disaster /s
Wow it‚Äôs really nothing like that tho. What a shit analogy lol
Well, Apple also just pulled an App from the app store that the HK protesters were using, because China asked them to. I wonder how many people burned their iPhones and MacBooks today over it. How many of those same people deleted their iCloud accounts?
My phone company hasn't politically sided with China nor has it done anything to censor me or opposition to China.

There's a difference here, one is "okay if you do business with us you cannot expect us to censor like you do" the other is "since we do business with China we're going to censor stuff they don't like"
We can move some of the files over to a cheap USB stick and burn that?
Also Chair Force. We were trained for this. Throw your PC away.
Burning something you already bought is a pointless display. Cancel any preorders you have, and say hong kong is why. Cancel any subscriptions you have, say hong kong is why. If you're within a refund window of any recent purchases, get a refund, say this is why. On your social media platform of choice, make it clear to Blizzard that you will give them 0 money until they change their stance. I canceled my WoW subscription even though I was thoroughly enjoying classic because this is unacceptable.

I can't see any downside to playing games you already own, though, unless you're buying something or getting non-blizzard ads in it.

China is denying Hong Kong basic human rights, so Hong Kong is protesting, for human rights. Not that hard to understand dickweed. We don‚Äôt know everything right, but we know that human rights are a thing that every human needs
A good reason to support them? Have seen the videos of the HK police beating the crap out of people?
Isn't it weird how free men can immediately tell who you work for?

It puts a strain on their resources as they are obligated to comply.
1. Let you know what kind of data is probably going to end up in Chinese government databases (they're famous for collecting first and sorting later, btw)
2. Annoy Blizzard because they have to deal with it, which isn't going to be cheap.
3. You can also request deletion of your data, reducing the likelihood of 1 and increasing the amount of 2.
Basically a DDoS that costs them additional money in legal fees per reply.
I think in the EU, companies are legally obligated to provide all the data they have on you upon your request. Like, literally everything. Logs, traffic data, purchase history, play time, any personal information they've logged, you name it. 

People are using this as a protest against Blizzard because they MUST comply and because the type of data gathered for each person varies so widely, this type of providing of data cannot be automated efficiently.

Full disclaimer: I'm also American and I read this from another user, so I might not be completely correct. But this is the jist.
They must provide you the personal data in 1 month otherwise you can sue them at the Court of Justice of the European Union and they have to pay some really big fines if the court do their job well (usually over 500k‚Ç¨)
Then youve got the right to request your data. Theres a list of things you have a right to request on the GDPR
Eugdpr.org
As far as I'm aware theres nothing comparable to the GDPR in America.
Edit: if you live in china I would be afraid to try, they might harvest your organs or something communisty like that
Many countries do have privacy laws that include a right to know what data is stored about you, so check your local laws.

New Zealand: [Privacy Principle 6](http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0028/latest/DLM297038.html#DLM297038)

> Where an agency holds personal information in such a way that it can readily be retrieved, the individual concerned shall be entitled [...] to have access to that information.

But observe the limitations and the possibility to charge you a "reasonable" fee.
Just ask for it without saying where you live.
If you don't specify they at least have to verify where you live in order to proceed. many companies that are part of the EU just do it anyway since the employee behind the job just sees it as busy work (if the company doesnt have a policy not to do it). though if they're busy they probably won't (aka like right now)
It would seem someone found a way, since they do business in California, theyre required to for anyone that requests it really
You heard him privats.

This has become major news with politicians weighing in. You're either not watching the situation or, are yourself, delusional.
wow and wow classic are a part of blizzard. no mercy, no prisoners.
Me
Oh I know. This is differently not the first American company to bend to the CCP's will. As a 3rd gen Chinese-American. I boycott all American companies that does shady business with the CCP trashes over there. I'm proud to be American and proud to be Chinese (by heritage). The CCP does not represent me, as they are the reason my family left that trash hole. The US and the US Constitution represents me and it pisses me to no bounds that an American company would do business with those fucks.
I didn't say HK people were Americans. I was thanking him for fighting for Americans of all races and creed.
Unexpected reddit "blowback" discussion warms my heart.
Men?!? They‚Äôre kids
That's why I said the imagery is still strong, even if financially it doesn't do anything for the boycott.
> If it wanted to, the US could use its military might to secure many more benefits for itself if it wanted, but refrains from doing so 

"They could be shittier, so let's not call them shitty!" What's your address? I want to come take some of your stuff. I won't burn your house down or anything, so you really can't complain.

No US conflict in your lifetime has been for others' benefits.
> Because shit doesn't stay cheap unless someone is making sure it gets here.

So, you're agreeing with him i guess?
Oh look, it's a bootlicking moron. Do you think the Korean war wasn't wildly profitable and secured long term contracts? What did Korea have to do with American freedom? Iraq had nothing to do with cheap oil for anyone except the oil industry, all your stupid ass has to do is look at the retail price history of gas. Further, you're not entitled to gas or cheap products ESPECIALLY at the cost of peoples lives. 

But most 16 year olds like yourself haven't cracked open a history book or anything of the like. Go read "War Is A Racket" and take your first steps into manhood.
LOL so Blizz would have made even more money then. I mean yeah totally boycottblizz right now, but see the bigger picture. Don‚Äôt create potentially more costs for you. 

Also i know that wow costs monthly. cancel your sub if you want to. But that overwatch tho. Just saying :)

Im not from the states but the reason i can be independent is because of my grandpa and many others that fell fighting for our country. I have more respect for him than anyone else i know.
What does that even mean
This is only meaningful if you accept that individual agency, responsibility, and action have meaning.  

For those that argue otherwise, it's very telling of how they think.
It's photoshopped in, badly.
Lmao some of you people are so delusional
Now, now. They're a propaganda *person.*

Just because they don't respect the humanity of other individuals doesn't mean we don't.
Oppression is only okay when America does it, duh. All this outrage about Chinese concentration camps, and yet try mentioning the literal concentration camps America is currently running almost anywhere on this site and you'll get shit on.

Not defending China by any means, but the complete lack of self-awareness is pretty glaring.
It's near impossible to escape Chinese investments and companies. But I think it's not difficult to avoid companies that are acting the way Blizzard does.
Lmao. Ok. America is American first, capitalist second. Test us. Blizzard sure is.
yeah, of course, im ungrateful to assholes that kill people and destroy countries for "freedom"

Wow, what a shit reply. But who am I kidding from a bunch of outrage sheep.....
None. Because it‚Äôs not the ‚ÄúIt‚Äù thing to do while the Blizz hate train is rolling.
Do you use an iPhone?
All I‚Äôm saying is that everyone is being hypocritical about this because the Chinese Company Tencent has say into almost every other game company, movies, and almost every other avenue of entertainment in China. They own like 5% of Activision Blizz stocks, 100% Riot Games (League of Legends) 40% Epic games,  11.5% Bluehole (PugG), Ubisoft 5%. Tencent produced movies like Mr. Rogers with Tom Hanks. They HEAVILY censor all of these things to fit their agenda. No one bats an eye, and some kid is under contractual obligation does something against said contract and gets dealt a punishment and everyone loses their minds. The kid is a hero, he knew exactly what he was doing. But don‚Äôt blame Blizzard for upholding their contract and businesses model. Hell Apple censored the Taiwanese flag for a while cause it pleased China.

can confirm. best way to max out this year's budget is to just throw away pcs and furniture.
Monthly active users is one of the most important metrics for investors. So if you want the greatest amount of impact, you really should stop playing their games altogether.
WoW subscription costs.
By not playing the games anymore you decrease the active player count which looks bad in the earnings call for the company. You also help contribute to scaring off the whales if they don't have anyone left to play with.
Pointless? Far from it. Especially if you turn it into a symbol. 
And if you are boycotting the company but still using the product s your just a hypocrite whose opinion has no value.
It's not pointless. It's the same reason we have funerals - the person is dead, what's the point? They're not going to appreciate it...? The point is to help people around them have some closure. 

People have been playing Blizzard games for decades. By deleting our accounts, by burning their games, it helps us move on. 

Human beings are not stone cold machines. We need crap like this sometimes.
It's not pointless. Imagine if a Blizzard executive comes on this sub and sees the top post being a guy burning their games, it sends a message.
I think it serve as a way to remove your attachment to Blizzard, people collect these boxes and toys from their favorite company over the years, its way way harder to comeback once they've burned these collection.
This!

Just refunded my copy of WC3 reforged, wc3 is literally my favorite game of all time, however I can't support a company which dumps democracy for the chance of some money, it's disgusting.
I mean, even if he burns WOW he still needs to cancel his subscription...
Destroying it can draw attention to a cause. But not playing it can also be helpful.

When someone uses something, enjoys it and talks about it, that's the best advertising (word-of-mouth).  Continuing to play can draw other people they interact with to buy/use/play it, which is what they're trying to avoid.  Cutting it out stops spread.
Ya if you have overwatch already just play that since no monthly sub, and also play only mei
considering physical copies give you a digital version in the end it doesn‚Äôt matter (except i guess for consul players). This is symbolic and just as powerful visual as canceling is from a monetary stand point.
Propaganda is important to ANY cause, be it wicked or benign. I‚Äôd say burning your shit is some good propaganda
I could see your argument if we're talking about people burning Nike shoes and stuff, but since the Blizzard launcher is a thing, this is nostly a symbollic gesture. He still has access everything contained on the discs.

That said, Blizzarf relies on people playing their games. Loot boxes in Overwatch, Subscriptions for WOW, microtransactions for WOW, the list goes on. By not playing WoW or other Blizz games, you hurt their overall subscriber numbers, their revenue from all those nickle and dime sources. Not playing the games you own is the strongest way to send Blizzard a message.
Play on their servers without buying lootboxes or their subscription.
He obviously burned them for the internet points.  


Internet points are the main reason people are outraged, I doubt many of the people actually care and will be over it once a game comes up at Blizzcon they like the look of.
USA only use drones on hospitals now
That helps them too and hurts the store selling it.

Often times stores only order more from the distributor based on current inventory and not sales (to help keep stock up accounting for shrinkage). By stealing and burning you're triggering the store to order more copies.
Just curious. "U.S. Army" wasn't too specific.
Yes, the altruistic army man should not be challenged, lest we seem like traitors.
Depends on what war is being supported. Most Western wars are pointless campaigns in babykilling for profit.

Actually its about why Blizzard banned and took the prize money away. Nothing to do with the guy. Everything to do with Blizzards hands in Chinese pockets. Because of that China has infuence over them. and because Blizzard lost their way, they decided to side with greed over Democracy and freedom of speech.
It's really not. Please stop spreading false information on this thread.
Just because you have given up doesn't mean everyone else should follow your advice.

I just had to do that Cyber training shit again. I hate it.
This.  Blizzard has set up MAUs as one of their primary success metrics for quarterly earnings calls.  If you want their investors to throw a shit-fit, log out of BNET, don't sign back into BNET, and wait for 3 weeks (which is when their next earnings call and BlizzCon happens).
As we all know they Trick around with Sold Accounts, not really active users. Cuz the number sounds better.
Just go to roblox and play a duplicate of the game you stopped playing
I hadn't thought of that. I thought that just cancelling my recurring 6 month subscription, telling why in the cancelling form and stop playing when it runs out (in 5 and a half month) was as much as I could do. I'll empty my mail boxes (I use them to store stuff I haven't got room for in my bags) and try to stop playing. I'm not sure I'm able to stop playing WoW unless I find some other game to scratch the itch. 

As a parting gift to blizzard I made a character called Freehongkong. Maybe I'm childish, but I thought it was funny.
If you think 1000 odd people will make a difference to their earning call your delusional lol
Companies don't care about symbols or hypocrisy. All they care about is the bottom line. What effects that is not buying from them. They don't care if you burn shit you already bought (especially since every blizzard game has a digital release now so burning physical media does literally nothing).
Like you who is probably using an iPhone to type this even though Apple is doing the exact same thing.
You're
If it helps you to do it, great, do it. My point was just that Activision doesn't care if a few hundred people burn some blizzard games. Just like Nike didn't care that people were burning their shoes or the NFL didn't care that people were burning their jerseys.
It sends a message that the person is mentally ill and they'll probably laugh about it.  


People will move on in a few weeks, this is a country that the majority of outraged people don't live in or have any dealings with. If you think a genuinely large number of people are going to avoid games they want to play based on that you're delusional.

You‚Äôre fucking pathetic.
Looks like we found the triggered libtard. ;)
Well you dont think in general do you? Otherwise you wouldnt respond to a total stranger assuming they know how they think.

Ooh kinky!
The entire USMC will starve
Yeah and not at all illegal like a DDoS lol
A friendly DDoS
So if I read this right, even though I don‚Äôt live in California, I can request my information and request to get it deleted because Blizzards HQ is in California, right?
Wow! Thanks for the link! Very interesting indeed.
What @quantamhope said. WOW
This law is not in effect until Jan 1st, 2020.
This is the link that was posted. Emailing the blizzard data protection officer requesting your data at DPO@blizzard.com should do it.

Even better is when people in the reserve find out they are called tampons :D
Not Sino-American, have a friend who is. She's following in your footsteps.
Who got baited by some recruiter
In other cases, similar destruction  (burning Nikes, smashing Keurigs, etc) actually backfired on the movement, making things worse. That's probably why people think it's a bad idea. But in this case, there's not really an "opposition" (nobody in the US is passionately in favor of the Chinese regime the way they're passionately in favor of Colin Kapernik) to accidentally mobilize into buying more shoes, so you're right that it can't hurt.
This could've been an intelligent debate, except that everyone started insulting each other.
Why does it matter how much the donation was? Even if it's 50 cents he at least donated, the real problem is that you're trying to undermine the action.
You could have sold it. That way you at least get some money back and you prevent that person from buying new copies "which supports blizzard" lol
.....all those boxes are just that, boxes, the games are tied to an account which given how fucking stupid he is claiming he fought for "our freedom", probably is playing WoW right now and just wants attention.
Having now have read up on it. It seems people are more mad that they guy was banned because of speaking his own political opinion, the money is just the icing
He posted an "update" photo in another post that was so horribly shopped he deleted the comment and the imgur post. 

This guy is a lying tool.
see mine
It's fake. OP posted another image then deleted. Its confirmed fake

OP's comment from a different post.
I agree it‚Äôs finally being noticed but people shouldn‚Äôt be cherry picking here. If you want to REALLY want to protest this and fight it, boycott ALL the companies that have censored dealings with the Chinese Government.
At least that one fucker isn't trying to get us to sign up for MyTunes anymore.

Also kinda still annoyed I did a 5-second double take when the one guy stole my phone.
sammmeeeee
You should post this in more threads, this is good info. I am not even playing Blizzard games now but will do it.
Try Pok√©mon Go, it is nice to get outside a bit. Maybe get sunglasses for the mole eyes, though.
Yo try ESO my man, the gameplay isn't exactly the same but it'll be easy to find a guild and is a pretty in depth realization of Elder Scrolls lore.
Well, then join them so the number gets bigger.
> If you think 1000 odd people will make a difference to their earning call your delusional lol

When it comes to WoW, they have had falling population numbers since 2010. This might accelerate the reduction. I've already had a lot of trouble finding players to cooperate with at non-peak hours, and increasing the population decline will only make this worse. At a certain point the whole thing collapses like a house of cards.
1000 odd people in the span of a few days will definitely make investors pay attention. Not enough to cause Blizzard much financial loss, but probably enough for the investors to tell Blizzard to knock it off with any future political statements.
It's not for companies it's for the people. And it won't be for most people just 1 or 2 out of a hundred that will be inspired by it.

Look it's a sales game to win hearts and minds. This helps. Will it make a big difference? Likely not but maybe you never no, but again likely not. But it will make a difference. That combined with the thousands of other geatures like it will have a combined effect.
Actually concurrent player count matters to their investors. Burning the shit is the same effect as not playing, which does impact them.
Do you like arguing with yourself? You literally just made something up about me to make me look like a hypocrite when you have literally zero information about me? How stupid are you?


And no I'm not using an Apple I haven't used one since the i4. For various other reasons.
Speak more carefully. Consider that the US has destroyed entire nations with which our people had no quarrel with or outrage against, simply to protect some small interest in the region and crush some bit of tyranny we took issue with.

A few outraged people is always where the big things start. Whether its a woman sitting on a bus, or a kid drawing graffiti on a wall in Syria.
Your defensiveness makes me wonder if you were in Iraq.
I think you're being paranoid.
Good point. I like war and all soldiers now.
Yeah, bro, hate to tell ya, idc what you *think* a word means. There are dictionaries, use one and look up what the word liberal means.
r/evenwithcontext
Certainly an important distinction. Thank you.
Nothing better than a legal DDoS simply because so many people are upset that it overloads the servers anyways.
Sounds about right to me. Fuckin get'em
Cool. 

Uh...what footsteps?
My point is, those games he burned because of his ideology are probably worth a lot more than your '50 cents' for the charity. Granted, this isnt gonna help the cause directly, but he took a stand and burned his games. Thats worth something too
Subscription fees.
100%. This post is as stupid as the circle jerk everyone is having now about their branch and how they think they‚Äôre sticking it to anyone. Brb gonna throw on my Affliction shirt and listen to some Disturbed.

I read yours.  You're an ignorant schmuck.
Wait, did you just use additional evidence that this is real as your argument supporting why its fake?
You gotta start somewhere with people, it's better to laser focus on a few things especially at first, we're told when door knocking for politicians to focus on what each individual cares about most, in this case people don't care about a lackluster Mr Rogers movie, in this particular case with this particular group of people it's Blizzard-Activision games.

Appealing to those who *do* care about that movie is important too but that's not something you'd do right here and now.
I accident put "chase him down" and my NCO shady eyed me. We both know Chair Force like myself cant outrun anyone.
Why should I? I am not negatively impacted by then and I have enjoyed many hours in their games previously and have made many good/close friends because of their games and that is something priceless to me. Also, I don't have an active subscription for WoW and all the other games are already bought. Deleting my account would be nothing but stupid of me throwing that money away and all that hard work/hours I put in to leveling, grinding and more.
Won't make a difference, mark my words.
Yeah and what will that do? Does Blizzard have more power than the United Nations or the countless others countries who have tried to oppose China? It‚Äôs a Chinese political problem that is far to complicated and goes much deeper than anyone on reddit is capable of understanding. 

Going against Blizzard has little to no impact towards the situation then again each to their on, if you choose to go against Blizzard, sure go ahead.
Careful with that. Cause if you just make it a "sales game" for hearts and minds you risk compromising the impact of the message to garner more "hearts and minds". Let the argument stand on its own merit and if it is sound it will stand. As soon as you make special efforts to "capture hearts and minds" with the attitude of "it's a sales game" then the result is less important. Gathering more to the cause becomes a goal more important than the cause. And then you've lost sight of the cause.
"I didn't get the answer I was fishing for, so I'll go ahead and assume it anyway".
Sating your curiosity definitely takes priority. How may I please you
Thank you for letting me know my family will keep their organs this month comrade

It doesn't go into effect until Jan 1 2020
Misread it, my bad.
Canceling those I understand. I'm speaking about physical merchandise. If I had overwatch on console, physical, id sell it. Not burn it.
Does this honestly look real though? Despite it being engulfed in flames nothing looks nearly as charred as it should be.
I respect your decision to protest, I will die for your right to do so (prior USAF SFS myself)  but I will also disagree in the way you do it. But fight your fight and keep the faith.
You had me in the second half, you turned everyone off in the first. That's a very childish/immature stance. "Well that doesn't affect ME". You'd think very differently if it did, and want all the support you could get. Other's lives are at stake, and you're taking the "not my problem" route
I don't think one single person thinks that Blizzard has any power over what is happening in Hong Kong. What people are trying to do is express their dissatisfaction with Blizzard for actively punishing someone for voicing their opinion on what is happening in Hong Kong.
Propaganda is important to ANY cause, be it wicked or benign. I‚Äôd say but in your shit is some good propaganda
Check his comment history. He‚Äôs pro China.

Ahh you're right. Oh well, still worth asking for.
Then you‚Äôre just transferring those subscription fees to the person who buys the discs, Blizzard loses nothing.
Yes, it does. The packaging for those games have clear-coats on them to make them more robust. It looks like the fire is just getting started. Look at the bubbling and cracking on the overwatch box. At that angle, you'd need a lot of practice and time to make the textures look high res and blended in like that. The flames are also very very difficult to fake over existing objects without giving it away that it's fake. I don't see why someone would spend hours and resources to fake this post. Do people spend more time faking stuff? Sure, but this would be pro level stuff for what return?
Of course I would act differently if it affected me but I am also smart enough to know that, lashing out at Blizzard for siding with China for a political problem (that is WAY deeper and more complex than any one on reddit understands) won‚Äôt make any difference to the situation. 

UN and many other countries have tried to contain China plenty of times and it hasn‚Äôt worked. You think some odd 1000 gamers boycotting an American companies games will? No, sadly that‚Äôs not how the world works.
Remember when being pro communism was just a meme to fuck with your gov teacher?
Lol i just noticed. Theres a couple tiny penis communists in here actually
Hey you. Go fuck your mother.
wow... go crawl in a ditch somewhere you child...
Lol wutta a fucking loser.

Can i do one for you now?

1. Is intoloerant of other peoples opinions that dont align to you own.

2. Uses no actual facts to argue their points

3. Uses character assassination tactics to try and silence them.

Are you perhaps a libtard living in california?
Overwatch has no subscription fee
>Save

To be fair, you're pretty defensive and bitchy with no reason.
Hes CCP, dont give him what he wants lol
You think that thing had a mother?

It has DLC. And permanently stopping playing something is still sending a message, stop being pedantic.
[removed]
It has loot boxes. Not dlc. You still stop permanently playing it by selling it instead of wasting your money. It's like you guys purposely don't want to understand.
[removed]
Oh it has lootboxes? That's literally worse. Also, if I'm stopping playing something on principal, why would I want to make it easier for someone else to play it by selling it to them? It's like you purposely don't want to understand.
[removed]
How is it easier? Because they aren't spending as much money as they would for a new copy? That may be so but you're still getting money back. They are literally supporting blizzard by buying a new copy, which is something you don't want them to do.
[removed]
I could engage your pedantism here and argue that someone looking to buy a copy off you isn't looking for a new copy in the first place, but this entire line of debate misses the point by miles, so let me put this in a different way:

Do you seriously not get the difference between no longer wishing to support a company or product and being outright disgusted with them? Does that sort of emotion not register with you? That's not a rhetorical question, I am legitimately curious. Burning the item means that they are divesting and disavowing a product in a way that is personal and has been historically symbolic. Let's say for instance, that I am a reformed former White Supremacist. In this instance, I am not selling my copy of the Turner Diaries to someone else, I am throwing it in the trash or burning it.
One less copy in the world. You must be young to not understand that clear symbolism and if you're pinching the couple bucks ya may get from resale.
would you burn/destroy your tv if the owner of the brand said they hated black people? yes or no
Would you stop beating your wife if I destroyed my imaginary television? Yes or no.
typical infant response
Your question makes just as much sense.

EDIT: You also completely sidestepped the question I had asked you in the post prior to that.
My question makes sense, youre just scared to answer it. How bout this. If you had a samsung tv and this situation was about the company samsung instead of blizzard, what would you do? You wont answer that question cause you're scared or being hypocritical.
Let me repeat my earlier question, because it seems conversation stopped after that: "Do you seriously not get the difference between no longer wishing to  support a company or product and being outright disgusted with them?  Does that sort of emotion not register with you?"

And to answer your question, if I had a television and found the manufacturer to be utterly reprehensible, then yes, I would dispose of it in compliance with California state law on the disposal of electronic devices (they take that sort of thing pretty seriously here) and replace it, because I know eventually it would eat at me even if I didn't think about it every single minute the way I might while playing Starcraft 2. This is a bit of a false equivalency since you don't need to replace a Blizzard game unless you have literally no other games, but yes, I would, just as I have lost money divesting petroleum stock.

EDIT: To be fair, I would also give said manufacturer a little bit of time to make things right, just as I probably would for Blizzard I were a WoW-head. But I completely understand where the Marine is coming from. And Blizzard seems to have tripled down for now.
Thats a rhetorical question. Just because you said it isn't doesn't change that. But ill repeat what I said to I guess answer that. If im disgusted with a company and dont want to support them, I will sell whatever I have of theirs. Not destroy it because that is my property and im preventing them from getting another sale.

and I dont believe you would destroy your tv. you would sell it
No, I was asking quite literally. I have to take your answer as meaning that that sort of thing does NOT register with you, thus the disconnect.

More than that, you can believe about me what you want. You asked, I answered honestly. Do you really think I would bother trying to get $40 for a used television through Craigslist if I felt nauseous about the device?
