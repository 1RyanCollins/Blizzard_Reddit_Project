You forgot robbed. I guess technically It’s in his contract though.
Damn, a 7/7 worth of stats! perhaps you should change the class to shaman and the text to **Overload (2)** so it buffs your tunnel troggs

Who ever is going to Blizzcon should totally print hundreds of these and pass them out.
 No one told me he was *handsome*! D:
I don't have a problem with blizzards  supporting China but they shouldn't be trying to impose their feelings on all of their customers. Surely deleting that guy acounts based on his  personal opinions political otherwise must have broken some consumer rights laws. 
And taking his prize money away tells future competitors that if they do win a competition they might get the prize or they might not depending on how blizzard are feeling I suppose pro gamers will still compete for the love of the game but it going to make it harder to convince them to travel to competitions and invest in the hardware thay nead to compet at that level.
Other Friendly Minions Gain **Enrage: -1 Customer**.
Death rattle: Shitstorm. Your opponent can no longer mute emojis.
You forgot his Deathrattle:

*Start a fucking revolution.*
Wasn’t there an addendum: this effect happens when you win the game.
change it to battlecry: an army of people who support hongkong
You forgot the death affect is to come back strong and louder than he ever would have been if they didn't try to make an example of him.
Except even the rule they used says they can use it at their discretion. Blizzard had the choice. They didn’t have to do this even by their own rules.
Yeah, this is one of the reasons why I like how the NFL handles issues like these... the nfl takes a hard line in the sand (which is perfectly reasonable) but the fines start off small and gradually increase (first offense is 7k and I think it doubles everytime after that).

This method allows the NFL to try and stay out of divisive topics, but still allowing its players a pretty easy avenue to speak up on whatever topic they want and not get overly punished.  I have no problem with Blizzard not wanting to get involved in such a heated topic... but to effectively take away someones entire salary for the season and then fire two people who didnt even try to ask Blitz to bring up the subject is totally over the line.

I would like to thank blizz though as I was about to preorder the new CoD game and drop some more # on Overwatch for my switch for when I travel... guess that $$$ is going to more beer from my local brewery lol
Is this why Eloise gave up hearthstone?
Instead of overload it just forfeit the coin from all your games.
The online version of Magic the Gathering is really good too.
That's cool and all, but seems a bit PR-y
And most deliciously, that rule exists to protect Blizzard's public reputation.  So if a player said something that caused harm to Blizzard's public reputation, they could penalize them for that. 

The wonderful irony is them using that rule has caused far greater damage to their public reputation than allowing him to express that sentiment ever could have. 

Womp womp.
What you said hits the nail on the head.  This is my stance on it as well.  As a company you need to maintain a level of neutrality.  That's fine.  

If Blizzard wanted to fine him, OK.  I don't *agree*, but if their tourney rules said, "discussion of politics will result in gradually increasing fines," I get it.  That's neutral, they're trying to make it about the game and not immerse themselves in politics.  Fine him a portion of his winnings, makes clear they're not endorsing his sentiment. 

I would even understand it if breaking the rules resulted in something like a tourney winner forfeiting future interviews.  Like, you can still participate, but, you just don't get any TV time.  Still a jerk move, but, I get where they're coming from if they do that.

But that's not what Blizzard did.  Blizzard *expressly* took a stand and they took a stand *with China* and *against* Democracy. 

What I'd love to know is, if a tourney winner said, "my respects to the People's Republic, I am a big fan," would they ban him and take away his money? 

I highly doubt it. 

So Blizzard is making an expressly political statement with what they did, and on precisely the *wrong* side of things.
Beer is better
Look at the guys comment history. It's just spam of the same comment
Well, ignoring it would mean China would block all of Blizzard's games inside China, which is a considerably bigger market than losing some of their western audience. I think Blizzard thought this as an acceptable loss. Especially considering a lot of westerners are weak willed and will just come crawling back sooner or later anyway. As for losing the Chinese market. Once you lose it, you're done, that's one of the benefits of having a centralized totalitarian state.

Disclaimer, I obviously am not on the side of Blizzard, but the direction they chose is understandable when you take the money argument. Emphasis on understandable, and not agreeing.
Check the link as well, its a promo-link.

 While this game might be good, this poster is using this opportunity to get free stuff with his link.
Damn leaches. They're everywhere
