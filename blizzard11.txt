This is how we win. We need to make blizzard characters the face of anti China. They will ban the games there and then blizzard will have to suck its own dick.
How do we... you know... make it happen?

***Let's do this.***
Smart.
Let‚Äôs make it happen Reddit family. Post this shit everywhere.
Yea, Blizzard would just remove Mei from the game tho...
I wish I had the money to give you an award.  This is the most beautiful idea I've heard of today.
This is the most brilliant thing I‚Äôve heard all day.
And we shall make it so
I support this
Such a shame.. (>;_;)> Liberate HK
Fight for freedom! Stand with HK!
Dont forget Chen stormstout and Pandaria are symbols of China too.
some advice :

Those words are wrong. if you want to say "stand with hongkong",the sentence should be"ÂÖâÂ§çÈ¶ôÊ∏Ø".  And please don't use this hongkong flag. It represent hongkong policeman. those protestors use black one.
Keep this up!!
You are a hero.
I would love to see Bastion's head plonked on Liberty Prime's body spouting pro-democratic catchphrases to represent the American support of Hong Kong's freedom.

As things gain traction and more nations voice their supports, throw in their own representative characters fighting by Mei's side as well. 

It would be great to have Tracer (UK) and Widowmaker (France) side by side with Widowmaker saying something like "We may be Talon, but we're not THAT evil" or some garbo.
Here is what I would love to see happen: All of this backlash and negative attention toward Blizzard and China results in Blizzard games being banned in China. Blizzard tries to make things right with players outraged by their kowtowing to China since they no longer can make a profit in China anyways. The players see through this bullshit for what it is, and Blizzard suffers massive losses this year as a result.
But that is not the flag that the protesters use.  See the red stars?
...but she's Chinese?
If you are on Hong Kong's side, this background is not ideal, because this flag is one that China has imposed on Hong Kong. It is the flag for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 


The protesters hate it so much that they defaced it and covered it with the flag that Hong Kong used when it was a British colony.

By using this flag as the background, you might, albeit inadvertently, be supporting China.
Blizzard side with Netease long ago, no wonder why they are now with Chinese government.
Can someone explain to me what‚Äôs going on? Why is everyone all pissed about Blizzard and what‚Äôs going on in Hong Kong? I feel literally so out of the loop
Haven't played Overwatch in ages, shall I pick it back up and exclusively play Mei and advocate for HK?
What does the caption say exactly?
Lets organize a pandaren protest in Azeroth
this is brilliant
Xi jingping kinda looking like Roadhog
It's officially confirmed guys, Mei is now ethnically Japanese. You didn't hear it from me, because Mei is already off live servers, hero roster, and all known maps.  


If you oppress one of us, you oppress all of us.
Blizzard has already cencored tracer and soldier comics mentioning their sexuality.
get #MeiWithHongKong trending on twitter!
Dude, that's a 400iq idea. If there are huge Mei posters in the Hong Kong protests, no one will be able to ignore it.
#MeiWithHongKong 

POST THIS HASHTAG
Now that I think about it, Xi looks like Roadhog.
Photoshop her middle finger raised and add "fuck China" in Mandarin (if you haven't already - no idea what's written below her).
Funny how I created a good number of these Pro HK Mei images, posted them here, and they got removed. But someone else posts and gets platinum rofl.

Either way, glad this one stuck and didnt get removed.
This is fucking genius!
r/boycottblizzard
More like just wiped from the game
Try simplified version.
ÁæéÁ´ôÂú®‰Ω†Ë∫´Ëæπ
It would be a shame, because then they'll remove Mei from the game and for those of us who actually still want to play Overwatch and use Mei as a main, it'll suck
Fan made video edit of Mei is already up.

Please God let this happen!
I love this community. We must keep fighting for what‚Äôs right.

Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!
Freedom of speech kowtow to CCP!
I cant believe i have to resort to this, but i want to support this... here's my poor mans gold. üèÖ
If this were the case, they would just delete Mei on Chinese servers. Still, let's do it
GENIUS
Odin bless you.
Haha, truly a shame

If you guys could settle on one costume / image / message.
FREE HONG KONG   


TAIWAN #1 !!!!!!!
While I understand the sentiment, and think it's in the right frame of mind, not sure getting Overwatch banned outright in China is the right way to go. That would stop a very large amount of Chinese players from being able to play their favourite game (I KNOW the issues Hong Kong is experiencing are much worse than a video game being banned).

To be honest, not even sure if what I'm saying is the right thing, but it's what occured to me. Fuck Blizzard and fuck the Chinese government though.

Why would this get Overwatch banned in China? It's just a fan creation, which wont be present in China, since in China half of the internet is censored anyway.
Reee but whatever

Support Mei, Support Hong Kong
This is 4D chess.
It's true. China should be tactical about it, as to reward loyalty, but they have zero chill, and definitely would ban it.

Also:

Instead of sucking its own dick, the more likely case is that Tencent will buyout more of the company so Blizzard will just have to suck more Chinese dicks instead

&#x200B;

I'm totally down with that though, fuck this company :'(
That's actually a really smart idea.  Take it out of Blizzard's hands so much that even if they want to adhere to China's demands, they can't because of the symbolism associated with them.  Make it not worth it to China to continue doing business with them.
We‚Äôre sorry
Blizzard sucking it‚Äôs own dick makes me excited.
Delusional.  Why would this get Overwatch banned in China? It's just a fan creation, which wont be present in China, since in China half of the internet is censored anyway.
They already edit the games in china to be in line with China's laws. So good luck with your 5head ban wagon that won't work and enjoy your virtue signalling for the week you're at it.

The go after Tracer next.....they can‚Äôt remove their mascot!
Well at least that‚Äôs good
Which would draw even more attention to them and further solidify their cowardice.
I always thought the UK simply shouldn't have given it back when the treaty elapsed. Or emancipated HK before the expiration and then instantly turn around and ask for US support and recognition as a nation state, followed by everyone else.

China would have had to just suck it, like anyone else who lost territories when global borders got really static a century+ ago.
Hmm, what does my text say?    

I actually just reposted it, it‚Äôs not mine, and I encourage anyone else to repost it on relevant subreddits as well.   Maybe the original creator can change it though.  (Don‚Äôt know who the OG person is)
Haha that would be amazing!    I want to see MCree going against Xing
Hong Kongers are also Chinese, only on a genetic level. Culturally, well you saw the news.
Udgir are also chinese that doesnt stop China to put them into concentration camp
There have been protests in Hong Kong to keep their liberty that they are used to after years of British rule. China has been finding ways to bring them back in line. Go read the news and get informed! Just stay away from political propaganda news sites like RT & Fox News.
 I was thinking of the same thing.   Perhaps joining China servers somehow and putting in chat ‚ÄúMei fights for Hong Kong freedom!‚Äù
So is Emily just missing or crudely re-drawn as a dude?
All I can give you is an upvote
They all have the same message behind them, so as long as Xing noticws one of them...
Wrong.

This decision for Mei to become a symbol of freedom is Lore-based on her character as a champion of hope.


What. Would. Mei. Do.
I hope it willl not be banned and Mei and Overwatch will become a symbol for a democratic Hong Kong.
If people not being able to play their video games is the SACRIFICE that has to be made to the altar of progress, so be it.
Blizzard will lose out on potential money. Why they picked the side of unfreedom was because money, so we‚Äôre stopping it. It is a punishment to blizzard
I see you post this everywhere.. Yes it's cool that they ''or u?'' did that. But don't post it under every thread please.
Well yes, but actually no.

What Blizzard did IS NOT OK.
Base Tencent*
Wish I were Chinese. 

Sounds like they are getting their dicks sucked a ton lately, and I want it
> the more likely case is that Tencent will buyout more of the company so Blizzard will just have to suck more Chinese dicks instead

In the end, it's about the same amount of dick. You know what I mean.
Yep, because people certainly haven't been able to bypass chinas shitty filters at all.

There's absolutely NO technology capable of doing that.

Especially none made for that explicit purpose,

Idk why would someone tweeting about a cartoon bear get said bear's cartoon banned in china? It's just a creation, and wasn't meant for china.

This actually could work, remember what the alt-right did with the pepe the frog meme? the SPLC considers it a hate symbol now. This is basically doing the same thing, except memeing overwatch characters as pro Hong Kong. Very possible if enough people push.
nope. u have to post it to chinese social platforms. thats the only way if you need the attention from ordinary mainlanders.
Wow Thanks for this! I didn‚Äôt know you could do this to someone. I‚Äôm going to take full advantage.
Blizzard removed skulls and bones and replaced them with random bread and wheat sacks in Chinese WoW, and censored several "inharmonious" Hearthstone cards *globally*, because it offended Chinese censors.

Blizzard would happily replace Mei, Tracer, Winston and any other hero from Overwatch with sacks of grain if it means they can keep sucking on the sweet teat of China.

&nbsp;

Still... go for it! I would love to see Blizzard completely ruin their trademarks for the sake of appeasing the always changing tide that is China's tendency to get offended by everything.
Well they've already made her straight in the Chinese version.
I'm afraid the UK is too busy trying to defeat itself currently
There was an overly optimistic chance that giving HK back to the mainland would have the opposite effect of what we're seeing now, a subtle way to introduce liberty and democracy into China. :( 

sad
I did learn this about 5 minutes ago. I apologize for my ignorant comment :(
Yeah but Mei speaks pretty clear Mandarin Chinese without any HK accent so it'd make no sense for her character to be from Hong Kong.
Either way, ActivisionBlizzard was this harsh about the HK thing because their deal with Tencent [just lead to the biggest mobile game launch ever and that was without the Chinese market](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/9/20906035/call-of-duty-download-number-biggest-launch-ever). So until people actually boycott all their IP this isn't going to do anything. They'll happily sacrifice Mei for selling more Call of Duty.
The comics are literally not released in China or Russia.

(Ironically, that's the reason why everyone knows about them.)
Yes, from Chinese users, who disagree with China anyway. Otherwise they wouldnt be using this. Btw, China has a population of nearly 1,4 billion people. 50 million hits per day is pretty low compared to that.
Free is a stretch since you have to pay for champions.
Nice
Haha nice one
Only the elites

Same amount as in count or volume?

But you'd be preaching to the choir
But chinese People who bypass the filters (therefore arent pro China) are not the people you want to adress with these actions. :) You want to get to the pro China people. But you can't because China is "protecting" them and they are okay with that.
Because if offended the leader directly.
Guess what. You both sound stupid.
>Found the Alt-right incel gamer.

Jesus Christ you are both the epitome of cringe
Do they even have social media platforms available outside of their country
Suddenly Mei decided to go on a research-trip to an unknown destination!

New hero to replace Mei: 

notasellout

special ability: build a long ass wall and prevent other characters from doing anything to harm notasellout.
Then we move to another character, and then another... They would have to remove them all. Our cost is 30 seconds in photoshop and spamming memes, theirs is remaking the game, see who wins.
Nah they will just announce a another current hero is gay! And western civilization will forgot about anything China for the next month
Please, don't be. 

All the things on this sub, all the memes, and support. These are what we need and we are grateful.  Thank You.
She doesn't have to be from HK to support. Might be more relatable if it's not just "one of them" to a mainlander anyway, but instead somebody who sees what's going on and doesn't like it.
Yeah but you can get in game cash quite easily
That's a mental image I could have done without.
omg this whole chain of comments is making me chortle. Bless up
Should've said "volume", damn
Oh you mean it negatively impacted perception of the country?

Just like how touting a character who is chinese as a freedom and democracy loving high profile individual would? Literally rubbing freedom and democracy all over the face of the game such that the authoritarian government officials notice?

Hmm. Yeah that wouldn't be denigrating to the image of the country at all. I agree with you 100%
What the heck you're talking about? Their social platforms are accessible by international.
you always have our support,never lose hope.
Yeah but what are they called? 

I‚Äôve never heard of a Chinese social media platform.
Weibo
If you're interested: 

Weibo is like Twitter (there are various Weibos, but Sina Weibo is most popular). 

WeiXin (WeChat) is like WhatsApp but with profile pages and stuff and is very popular. People can add/follow pages or people by scanning a QR code. 

Renren is kinda like Facebook but isn't used as much these days. 

Douyin is TikTok but runs on Chinese servers (TikTok is a new thing that's like Vine but longer videos and is particularly popular in India). 

YouKu is like YouTube.
Weibo = Twitter       
Tieba = Reddit    
Zhihu = Quora   
Renren = facebook but it is not mainstream in china because they all using QQ/wechat which they can post social status and articles.    
Also quick tips if you see any players with names start in "Douyutv" "bilibili" in the game and you don't want them to be there, type Free Hong Kong in chat and make sure to include their ID. They are streaming, u know what i mean.
baidu and bilibili also
