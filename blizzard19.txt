I’m glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family’s organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
Bring that baby down.
1 day trading down really means nothing. It's still at one of the highest points in the last 6 months and even in the last week the price has been lower.
The stock price drop has nothing to do with the protests.
This means absolutely nothing. The entire market was down today.
This reminds me of when Ea's stock went down slightly for battlefront 2 and everyone rejoiced claiming they destroyed the demon finally, zooming out the little blip was natural and barely scratched them. Don't jump to thinking you're destroying blizzard just yet,i doubt this will hardly be a dent.
It's down 2.3% last I checked now.
Great. Now zoom out to 5 days.
lmao 2% is not even remotely significant
The stock market does this all the time, sadly they’ll recover and this will blow over in a week
Yes, so my all in ATVI puts will bring me tendies
The whole market is down today...
Yep, bought my puts today. I’m ready for the big catch
Gonna be real, their stock price likely won't move much at all unless a lot of people quit blizzard products, and even then we won't see much effect till  the end of quarter results.

It's best to not trade on emotion because the market probably doesn't feel the same way.
Blizzard is over guys! Soon they'll join the grave alongside EA!
I had about 10 stocks in it, and was waiting to sell till Christmas. Guess Christmas came early this year.
Glad many of the games I play moved away from that company looking at you destiny 2. Hope we make them think about this and to a retcon to their statements
I hope it drops like a fucking rock
F blizzard!! F china
I bought in before Classic. I'm selling tomorrow.
Investors are gone 🦀🦀🦀
lol i like that it went up a little bit for a second.... then 'nope we're still falling'

I will be protesting at Blizzard HQ in Irvine on 10/10/2019. Please come join me! Thank you! STAND FOR FREEDOM. LIBERATE HONG KONG.
I check this regularly since Diablo Immotal anouncement. Stock dropped by half after that announcement. Then they cut a bunch of staffing. Fake articles continue to say now is the time to buy blizzard. Its hilarious. This should take it to a new low. 

There was also great article from ex employee of blizzard. Talk about how they lay off ful time employees then hires them back with big cuts.
sadly that new modern warfare will probably prop their stock right back up. i doubt most people will even see activision games as part of blizzard when they 100% are
RIP my Activision calls :(
didn't these SCUMBAGS work with south park making that WoW episode? china should ban all their games for working with such an evil cartoon
oopise
Had me in the first half not gonna lie
Time to short swap contracts.

 Activision/blizzard is down 30% this year still.
My friends over at r/wallstreetbets tell me to buy puts.
May not seem small, but it’s a start.
I think the idea isn’t to sell your stocks, it’s to make it less attractive for others to buy stock because of lower sales, etc.
Not only that but individual stocks go down with the whole market. Wake me up when they are down 5% on a green day. Also check out this order flow https://imgur.com/PxWBmLR.jpg. Seems to be greater on the buy side even though the stock price is dropping slightly. Not totally certain how this correlates with stock price but it could be that it is being artificially pumped by Chinese sympathisers.
Let them belive that if they boycott companies with China interest they have to boycott almost everything they owe even your mobile phone, TV even your cloth which is made from China. A lot of mobile phones has electronic parts from china. HK protesters orchestrating a hate train and hope that a lot of people jumping in try to move the mass. It's just interesting if you observe the bad China news subs.
You're not wrong, most stock dip this time of year, and most stocks dropped like this today anyways.

You'd have to get far more backlash than this for that shit to really drop, unfortunetly
why are you downvoting this guy?
[deleted]
Profiting from the dismay of the big evil corps babyyyy
Now that you told everybody your plan the stocks are gonna soar.
I'm not sure what you're looking at. YTD they are up. They started the year at 47.03 and the OP has them at 57.13
Why does that matter? Since the news story blew up they are down 2.31%. But the S&P as a whole is down 1.56% so it very easily could just be random noise.
Using /r/wallstreetbets for financial advice is like going to /r/funny for humour
While you're at it, go for some TSLA $420 6/9 Calls
Short the stock
Sorry but what is that app?
Stop gatekeeping. People can start taking positive steps slowly as they learn.
The amount lost is inconsequential (Im fairly close to even) and I want to show my intentions in the best way I can.
I win either way.
I'm looking from Oct to Oct. they were ~$77 oct 2018.
Could be. But every dip starts somewhere we'll have to see how it goes the next few days.
On it. Thanks fam.
I would recommend CD Red Project.
Looks like Webull I think.
Money over morals right?
Go grab your tendies out of the microwave oven spankle
Yes it bombed in early October when Blops4 didn't sell well and the stock was thought to be generally overpriced at that point. It took a further dent after last years Blizzcon and Diablo announcement but it's still performed well and today's blip is just that. It's meaningless in the grand scheme of things.
Then it's not "this year" that's the same time last year, year to year, or year over year.
Edit: my wording was misleading so i removed the first part.


 Its been a bad year for trading. *looks at trump*
The last time reddit got into a frenzy over a video game company there was a post on r/all about how EA was getting killed because the stock was down like three percent. It ended up hitting a new all time high a couple weeks after that. The stock market isn't going to give a shit about this.
Inverse him / her for fistfuls of tendies
Morals are subjective. I have my own. I morally object to this young generations want for a global police state that rules with an iron fist and intervenes in every situation they find morally reprehensible. Just because we have internet now doesn't mean we should be meddling in others affairs. HK will fight for their own freedom just like every other nation does. They are not being executed in mass. Its riots and protests. Just like arab spring, just like Egypt, just like Bolivia, just like Kyrgyzstan. You dont need to scream for intervention every time a country is fighting a civil war
I did
People here don’t know how or why stocks move or how stocks work. I remember last October the whole market was plunging and /r/gaming just about lost their shit because they were so happy EA stock was falling.
i really just blame last years diablo shit fest.
It hasn’t been bad YTD, but the swings were wild. You don’t make money buying in at $30 and selling at $50, you make money trading derivatives on the wild flashes whenever Trump yaps about his stupid trade war. If he gave me a heads up the day before every time he’d tweet something stupid, I’d be a fucking millionaire.
What in the fuck are you talking about haha?? Market is close to an all time high. I hate trump, but just saying stupid, completely incorrect things about stuff you obviously don’t know anything about is moronic.
HK activist try to create a spiral of hate trains and hope people jumping in!
It's just interesting to observe how they orchestrate that.
Omg I love tendies.
If companies are interfering, why shouldn’t we?

I mean, companies are people, right?
"I morally object to this young generations want for a global police state that rules with an iron fist and intervenes in every situation they find morally reprehensible."

are you being ironic or do you really not see the parallel with china lol
I'm willing to die for what I believe in and you're just a coward. History will show you're on the wrong side.
Yes and that was clearly because reddit said “EA bad” which is why it is almost bankrupt now right? Because Reddit has said “EA bad” for years now it must be a worthless company?
> [/r/gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming) just about lost their shit because they were so happy EA stock was falling.

Are they all teenagers? Do none of them have 401ks or IRAs? I had to stop checking my balances last year because it was so depressing.
But he is the brightest and best ever what do you mean? He reminds us of that at least once a week. 


Also /s incase anyone doesn't realize that
Tf you mean you don't make money buying at 30 and selling at 50?????
You know what, youre right, i worded it really badly. What i meant was in the past year and ytd the market has been very unstable, with wild swings happening every other week. Take a look at the past 100 days of trading and compare it to the past 4 years, and you'll see that ever since trump took office the market can swing over night (usually over a tweet). People have lost a lot of money. Though im guess if you are just putting money into an index fund and not check it. You wont notice it compared to short term traders.
Blizzard isnt interfering you halfwit. What they are doing is shitty and stupid but they are not interfering by penalizing a player for an interview.  Such a sensationalist.
Lol are you? Hop on a plane and head over to hong kong then big guy. Send a pic. 

I'm a coward based on what? The fact that I dont think foreign countries should interfere in a civil war unless it becomes genocidal? 

What side is it you think I'm on? I hope HK is successful and gets their freedom and china gets put in their place. That doesnt mean the world should destroy itself to save them. 

You're not willing to die for shit because you are sitting here typing with me on reddit. Go do something then you little chihuahua

>Are they all teenagers?

Yes
I'm not 100% certain and someone can feel free to correct me, but stocks don't typically move that much overnight. That's going to be time invested. I think he was trying to say daily trades are moreso where it can be made.
