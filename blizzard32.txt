Let's make sure number 4 and 5 actually happens first though
Either way Blizzard was going to get hit.  
They picked the hard way out.
Claim that every Overwatch character looks like Xi Jinping one by one, until they remove them all.

Starting with Roadhog.
Wouldn't they just remove Mei from the game rather than lose China playerbase, I mean if Blizz asked CCP nicely and they were allowed to do so.  Lets make DF and Sigma the next mascots for Free HK

Brilliant
Okay, so we are going to use Blizzard to ban Blizzard, well:  


Why don't we just make China a mascot of Hong Kong liberation and get **China** banned in **China?**   


Its a flawless plan.

Let's do it!
Thanks for the platinum, kind stranger!!
People need to find out what company runs blizzard's servers and start boycotting them as well. A company like this should receive 0 support from consumers or other companys.  Don't just stop there or using video game characters as well, also find out who produces their merchandise and who sells it. Boycott ANYONE that supports Blizzard. The whole HK situation is showing what pure evil and good really are.
Dont worry Blizzard just officially  **apologized** on the chinese Weiboo account **to china** that something bad happened and that they stay strong with the dignity of china.

&#x200B;

so yep. blizzard is choosing china they dont care.
"Time to start a blizzard!"
Did they really ban the commentators too?
i really hope this happens
wrg, smile any no matter what
did 4 acutally happen? that would be so tasty
I hate outrage culture 
So many idiots blowing things out of proportion of what's reality.
wow so china also banned overwatch what a shocker they despise videogames and shouldnt have ever allowed videosgames back in the country because now our games are being shitty and we have shitty movies due to china
"..who did nothing wrong."  
Yea, lets pretend that he didn't break the rules or lets just assume that breaking the rules is fine.
Oh I will be so excited if number 4 happens.
I thought for a moment it had happened.
They miscalculated badly and will suffer because of that.

They already locked the option to delete battlenet accounts and now require sending them photo of ID. That's almost certainly illegal in EU (you can't ask for personal information in order to let people delete the personal information you already have), and they will likely be hit by a big fine (Microsoft and Google got fines in billions of dollars for breaking EU law). EU is a bigger market than China despite less people.

So yeah, it will hurt them. Maybe it's still worth it, but I doubt.

Xi Jinping does looks like Roadhogs bellybutton
Hey! That’s an insult to Roadhog!
That's going to screw with their OWL league or w.e.
Is Mai going to be banned from all OWL events? What about the next character that's picked, and so on. It's a losing proposition for Blizzard and that's a huge win for human rights.
That's why Every Overwatch character needs to be used in some way, not just Mei. Mei still needs to be the leader of this.
If they removed Mei from the game because of this, the backlash would double what it is now.
Unlike Blizzard, he did nothing wrong!
You've posted the exact same comment on pretty much every thread.  I wonder if it'll flag you as a bot.

!isbot
Should've is a contraction of should have, not should of.
Everyone in that subreddit already knows about it. If you really want to protest, then other protestors aren't the best audience to target. If you want a lot of people to know about it, then your best bet is to post about it in subreddits not directly related to Blizzard (but stick with that subreddit's rules and try to submit it in a way relevant to them). There you'll find and inform a lot more people who haven't heard of it yet.

We are trying to get images, Art, memes, cosplayers and links to protest Blizzard and support Hong Kong

Thanks for supporting with your post!
Activision, their reputation has already been shit, this is probably gonna be the final blow
Just boycott amazon, I bet they will run out of money soon.
Pretty sure they are relying rather heavily on amazon AWS servers.
any source for this?
More like "end a blizzard"
They were giggling under the desk after they told him to say his eight words. Seems like they knew a rule was about to be broken. Not that it's right. I unsubbed, still love a lot about most of their games but would rather stand with Blitzchung and HK.
4 and 5 are the stretch goals
That hasn't happened. That's the goal of the people trying to turn Mei into an icon for HK protestors.
I don't believe that actually happened. Or I can't find any corroborating article on it.
Did you ever read about the Civil Rights Movement ?
>rules or lets just assume that breaking the rules is fine.

Sometimes rules are bad and need to be broken. What is moral isn't always lawful.
Taking a step back, that does not seem like a good thing at all. The ideal scenario is that China does not ban games just because they criticise the CCP. Yes, Blizzard deserves to face consequences for this, but I fail to see how the CCP censoring a game could be a good thing.
Hah! Jokes on them! I used an old Student drivers liscence from the US! And I'm a Canadian citizen.
Idk if you've seen but people have been mass unsubbing and deleting their account.

Chinas revenue to blizzard is around 6% atm. They did this too soon, and if enough people do something, it WILL hurt them.
/r/thanosdidnothingwrong
I'm surprised there's not a bot for this.
Well you can help me then. I am logging off soon :)
Checkout r/ProtestBlizzcon
hasnt activision been shit sice the ps3 era though(i only played their ps1 games which were supported by NEVERSOFT)
Along with an entire *1%* of the Internet.

Pretty hard to boycott Amazon.
All over reddit where the posts don't get censored heavily (most subs)

https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfkmp1/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/
On principle, of course China censoring a game is bad, but there is a certain irony and justice for Blizzard to bend over backward to support China only for the whole controversy to result in them losing the very Chinese market they fought to keep
It's not that, it's the fact that because Blizzard never acknowledged the fact that what they're doing is wrong, they won't have the support of the rest of the Blizzard community. As a result, it's gonna hurt them that much more.
I think getting OW banned is a very good result.  This would make any other corporation think twice about bending over to China if the people are willing to get the company in bad terms with them.
The point is to force Blizzard's hand. If Overwatch is banned, then that throws a wrench into their financial calculus -- if one of their big titles can't be used in the Chinese market, does it still make financial sense to support China despite the backlash from Americans and Europeans?
yes it would seem that way on reddit, but is that the case in reality?
They could always say fuckit and just shift everything to China.
There is. I've been hit by it too many times
They recouped some rep with Crash, Spyro, and CTR.
Thank you.  Exactly this.
I totally get that there would be a sense of satisfaction in Blizzard's censorship backfiring against them, but when you fight fire with fire, everyone burns. Nobody wins in that outcome, but Blizzard deservedly loses.

I think a better outcome would be for Blizzard to embrace China completely, only to be shunned by the West and see their revenue plummet when they realise there isn't as much money in China as there is in the rest of the world.
In reality there are people unsubbing and/or deleting their accounts. So yes, in reality this may have an effect, the impact of that effect will depend on the numbers. I unsubbed and deleted my account. They wont see a cent from me, in the end my decision alone wont hurt Blizzard, but that doesnt mean I have to support them. Fuck Blizzard.
No lmao there are still over a million active users on WoW alone
Ain't gonna be that easy by a long shot
Or burn them out of the market completely, it's almost given that you lean towards money as a business, but if the direction of the company has no morals other than money, it should burn down completely.
You do realise forest fires are often fought with controlled fires, right? Fighting fire with fire is exactly how you stop said destructive fire from spreading, snuffing it out.
The problem with that is that there frankly is more money in China than the rest of the world. The amount of potential gamers in China to get money from is many times every other major country. You think they would be doing this if they only got 5% of their money from China? They’re doing this because they can potentially drop their entire western audience and still make more money than before off China. 

The only way to actually punish blizzard is to remove that option from the equation. We have to get the games banned in China.
You're an inspiration!
Only a Million not two million?  i remember 12 million in WotLK xD
blizzard get 12% of their revenue from the whole of the asian region
Idk the exact numbers, this is just the lowest possible guess. And I'm talking about who's online, not active subscriptions
