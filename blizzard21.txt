You're damn right this won't be over quietly. Fill this subreddit with trash, delete your accounts/uninstall bnet. 

Blizzard died to me when they banned blitzchung.

#MEISUPPORTSHONGKONGPROTESTORS
Any apology will be nothing more than the PR department trying to salvage this. There will be no honesty in it, just angst to lose more stock value.
I doubt their apology will do any good at this point, they need to say something before blizzcon though.
This isn‚Äôt how you use this meme.

But that‚Äôs none of my business.
Blizzard is too busy making these new rules to give attention to the free world‚Äôs wrath:

1. Only #CCP Chinese players may win during tournaments.

2. Non-CCP Chinese players must repeatedly shout ‚ÄúAll Hail China‚Äù during games.

3. Should any Chinese players want anything, other players must willingly give it up to them or face suspension from the game.

4. Players must agree to forfeit privacy since China has the right to ask Blizzard to submit all gamer info in exchange for sweet sweet RMB.

Edit: Extra words
I hope they get nonstop heckled at blizzcon and it's a fucking trainwreck
At this point they pretty much have to say *something*. It's gotten to where now it's just not our outrage, but the outrage of American Senators. I have a feeling whatever they say is just gonna cause round 2 of gamer explosions though. This will not end well.
Good luck dealing with this at Blizzcon, Blizzard.  Whatcha gonna do? Call off the event? Photoshop every umbrella, gas mask, placard, banner, and sloganed tshirt in every photo? Eject anyone carrying such? Hire paid actors or staff to ask Q&A or simply cancel all Q&A? 

Keep hiding, you gutless fucks.  You can't hide forever.
They have already posted a response on Chinese Twitter (weibo). It's an apology, to the Chinese.
How have they not responded yet?

 A PR 101 student could figure this one out.
[removed]
Blizzard already put out a response. To China.

Have you guys learned nothing from the 1000 internet outrages of the past? Of course this Will blow over quietly. The internet has no attention span, will be distracted by the next big story and the apathetic will carry on handing Blizzard their money.
Nice message, but not the right meme.
can't wait for blizzcon.
[imgflip.com](https://imgflip.com) yikes , nice meme though.
I just picture Kermit saying this with a pistol on his lap ü§£ü§£ü§£
It's in their best interests to not respond at all, that is, if they don't intend to fully reverse their decision and apologize.  Without begging for the people's forgiveness, saying anything is just going to further dig a hole they can't get out of.  Honestly what can they even say?  They posted an apology thing to China stating "As always, We will defend the pride and dignity of China at all cost."  You can't really explain that away.  There's no reason to even open a dialogue with people, all they can do is hope it blows over.  

Thing is, this isn't going to blow over.  Blizzcon is in three weeks and people are already planning to protest, both inside and outside.  This is not going away, so just pack your things and get out now before they delete more functionality from their website so you can't cancel things.

They did apologize, "Blizzard's Chinese Weibo wrote:

"We are very angered and disappointed at what happened at the event and do not condone it in any way. We also highly object the spreading of personal political beliefs in this manner...We will always respect and defend the pride of our country."

Oh shit you mean apology to non-Chinese government. Yeah that won't happen.

#Free Hong Kong!
Have to agree with this post. The longer they take to address the issue, the angrier I get. Probably most people feel that way as well.
They knew there would be blow back. They do not care. Chinese market is far more lucrative the Western markets are.
I'm upvoting this post 2 days later, still no word from Blizzard.  This post is aging like fine wine.  

The shit winds are blowing, Blizz.  Delaying only makes them blow harder.
Blizzard are fucked.

Imagine being like 99.9% of the Blizzard employees who had no input in this decision. Within a work week they've gone from top of the world, perhaps even gods of the heavens, to wallowing in filth in the 666th layer of hell and they have NO IDEA how to escape.

LOL... more iced tea for me!
[removed]
I call bullshit.  Remember that billionaire that was in jail for diddling kids and mysteriously died?  Yeah, no one gives a shit anymore.  In 2 weeks Trump will tweet something that offends someone and no one will care about this.
There is no response, nothing they can say will speak louder than their actions. they're well and truly fucked.
They are in classic zugzwang (hat tip to Lodge 49 for the introduction). Anything they do is going to upset someone, and there are now so many people to please (people in Hong Kong, people in the rest of China, the Chinese and American governments, the playerbase, the non-playerbase that knows about this anyway as it's now been in the mainstream media, Chinese and non-Chinese investors, employees, partner companies - and aside from the Chinese government, none of those are monolithic with a single opinion throughout) there is no way to thread that needle. 

 I haven't cancelled my account yet, and am eager to hear what they say, but i have zero faith in a worthwhile response, and anything short of buying out the Chinese investment will ring hollow to me. For now, the silence is deafening.
But it will blow over. That‚Äôs the problem. This is just the latest PR issue for them
The fuse they lit last BlizzCon is about to reach the 100-Gigaton payload.

CAN'T WAIT to see heads roll at Acti-Blizz.
It starting to show how much control blizz has over channels.  
There are Facebook groups that are helping control the message etc.  
Along with the "MOD WHO LEFT AND TOOK THE SUB"  
Makes you wonder who all is on the Blizz Payroll.
Pitter patter let's get at 'er
TikTok.* FTFY.
Well, not like people are waiting with open ears for them.
At this point I would not believe anything blizzard says. Actions speak louder than words. If nothing gets done and all they release is a bunch of words then stop playing these games. When you think about it, YOU spent your money and made their fortune. YOU devoted your life to playing these games. YOU generated with your passion BILLIONS of dollars for this company. Now someone with a decent chunk of cash bought stocks and THEY become the main "voice" of the company? Fucking deplorable. Stop feeding this beast your life energy and switch gears people. Vote with your wallet. Stop spending money on companies that consider you a resource and nothing more.
r/adviceanimals
Good point, horrible meme choice. Downvoted.
Apologies mean nothing without changed behavior
This isn't even the correct usage of the meme, and people will forget, trust me.
No matter what they do now it will be known that they do not stand for human rights and didnt even hesitate to show it and if they change their mind then it just proves that they still dont stand for human rights and it took mass amounts of backlash to even make them reconsider at all.
I woke up this morning to this bad news. Came back home this evening hoping to see a response.

 Very disappointed in them.
Doesn't matter what they will respond with now. It's probably best for them to silently stick to it at this point.
Can't wait to hear the very obvious PR statement from Blizzard with lots of "we apologize", "we are NOT doing this for China, you think we are, but we aren't", "we were only following our rules", "we listen to your feedback", etc.
Is it time for second dinner?
Didn't they already put out a response?

It was a bad one, but still a response. They made their views clear.
Any "apology" by Blizzard that does not mention that they will be reinstating Blitzchung and those two casters and giving him his prize money back can be safely discarded as meaningless corporate PR-speak.
But that‚Äôs none of your business.

Edit: spelling error
Pitter patter lets get at 'er
this is an interesting thread
do you guys not have phones?
What is everyone in uproar about with blizzard?
If you're from europe use this site https://shipyourenemiesgdpr.com/ to have a pre made gdpr request and then mail it to 	DPO@blizzard.com
It feels like the SWBF2 event again in certain ways. Already has politicians attention.
Apologise and piss off the Chinese  
Dont apologise and piss off every free, democratic western nation....  


The ONLY thing they will take into consideration is who contributes more revenue.
Low quality meme



























I agree so heres an upvote
And this is everyone's business.
Blizzard Won‚Äôt Hear You, They Will Placate You. So I Have Asked Fidelity, My 401K, Remove All Investment Into Blizzard / Activision / And Tencent. I hope everyone else does the same.
The fact that they haven't said anything yet screams "we have weak leadership!" A non-response indicates a lack of leadership in both the C suite and the board of directors. 

Activision's current leadership is taking their cues from Nero!

If you own Activision stock make your voice heard at the annual meeting and vote for a new board.
Hey I know. Let's make memes and jump on a "I Hate Blizzard" bandwagon, instead of actually being proactive with human rights organizations.
I call bullshit.  Just a matter of silent time.
I don't care if they make one or not. The fact that they already showed they don't care about human rights on American soil is a fucking joke. Uninstalled all their shit from my computer. Now i can fit more stuff on my SSD.
They put out a response. They apologized.

To China.
I'm just here waiting for the tweets and screenshots about infighting in blizzard hq lul
Ironically, TikTok banned pro-Hong Kong content.
They can fix this with action. Specifically cutting off all financial ties to China and brand themselves as supporters of freedom everywhere and backing it up with support for those movements.
[They did post an official response,](https://old.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfkmp1/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/) an apology to China.
It's bullshit, but it's totally going to blow over.  It's hot right now, but in a month?  Once it's dropped off everybody's various feeds?  It's exactly why Blizzard is staying quiet; they know the gaming community.  The vast majority of it is basically a collective 14 year old who thinks fart jokes and human rights abuses are basically the same; lulz.  The twitter mobs will get bored and move on, Blizzard will keep releasing tedious crap, and the addicts will keep playing (and paying) no matter what.
Fuck blizzard.
Bobby Kotick is in Jeffery Epstein's little black book.
Going down with Trump.
Only comment (besides the bootlicking to china) is this:

In a response to engadge a Blizzard spokesperson said that the company is, ‚Äúassessing the situation for now,‚Äù 

AKA Blizzard is trying to figure out which Corporate BS to choose:  
A) Hope this will all blow over in a week

B) Hope they can put out some US only BS apology

C) Reveal Lucio to be Pan Sexual 

D) Wait for some ass hat to publicly threaten a dev so they can cry Victim

Its already worse, evidently a US college team held up a free hong kong sign last night and they cut the video feeds and cancelled all interviews for the night.  


Its not a one off.
I can hardly wait for the next developer update, it will be a fucking field day for Jeff.
Well there's this... Not sure what it is though

 https://twitter.com/thebencheah/status/1182128750051250176
Actually it will blow over quickly, just like everything in our news cycle these days. Same reason we don‚Äôt see posts about the Amazon anymore.
I wish that was true. They're probably going to just stay completely silent and hope we lose intrest. And honestly, even if they lose their entire market in every other reigon of the globe... They'll still have china. Which is the biggest of all their markets. Hooray for capitalism. :/
But that's none of my business
I feel like ‚Äútick tock mfs‚Äù would have been a perfect close
I think Blizzard just made their overlords angrier with how they handled this lmao
Yo, I heard that Blizzard is selling us out to China so they can harvest our organs, where do I sign up?
Blizzard actually released apology already, for the Chinese government, from their official Weibo account.
Plot Twist: Blizzard villianizes itself to raise awareness for the Hong Kong Protest.

Like Doktor Manhattan in the Watchmen movie.

If this is not the case (most likely) blizzard can go to hell and die
Whenever shit hits the fan with Activision games, they literally just ride it out and ignore it until it goes away. Honestly won‚Äôt surprise me if they just attempt to do that in this situation.
The best apology we could get is Bobby Kotick's resignation, and the resignation(s) of the individual(s) responsible for this mess.
This post is gross. Yeah lets attack blizzard instead of actually Chinese government institutions, seriously folks? Uninstalling hearthstone will make a difference, just for Blizzard, not for China. If you want to do actual damage, why not mass petition, go to the Amnesty international website, they sure could use all this channeled anger to make actual statements!
thats not how the meme works, and this is already blowing over
Lol what are they going to say. 

*Hey guys this isn‚Äôt what it seems, I swear!*
I think they‚Äôve made their stand. They said they would do whatever it takes to protect China. We are the price they paid.
Why are people even wanting a response? Its going to be the standard company PR BS that has no meaning behind it anyway. What they did now is enough, why is everyone so keen for a follow up?
I think this is the wrong use of this meme right?
As my coworkers know, if you ever slight me, I will actively work to make your life a living hell.

I'd like the "Do you not have mobile phones?" guy to make the PR apology.
They've responded with censorship by deleting top posts. Save your content people.
Some would complain if the response was too quick.

But yeah, too long is bad.
This will only get worse for them if they don‚Äôt make a statement.

And if they do give a statement I‚Äôm 100% anything they can possibly say will be them throwing gasoline into the flames. They cannot win.

Grab your pitchforks and popcorn boy because I‚Äôm here for it.
This meme format is not used correctly.

But that's none of my business...
I swear the majority of you will go back to worshipping blizzard again when they make a half assed "sorry" post on twitter.
I support the message.  

I don't support your use of meme.  "It's none of my business" Kermit is the wrong message for something that should be every gamer's business.

Plus, you didn't even do the meme right, man...

Let's make it 10k by BlizzCon.
Sucks Activision had to be part of this. Please issue an apology before Oct 25.
I‚Äôve been a Blizzard fanboy since wasting years of my life playing WoW. 

For me, their reputation has been shattered. The damage they have done to their brand is immense. Once brand loyalty and trust has been lost, it‚Äôs just a matter of time before revenue takes a hit.

This black stain on their brand will become a cancer.
Can't wait for the shitstorm that is Blizzcon 2019, unless they cancel it, that is.
Blizz PLEASE respond and fix this.. a small fine or warning for breaking CoC is fine, what u did was not fine
Now we have the New York Times writing on it, this has gone beyond Reddit and into the press people. Historically this is when companies start to actually care and attempt damage control. 


https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/world/asia/blizzard-hearthstone-hong-kong.html

Also, Rubio isn‚Äôt exactly someone I like but he‚Äôs right on point here:

‚ÄúRecognize what‚Äôs happening here. People who don‚Äôt live in #China must either self censor or face dismissal & suspensions,‚Äù Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, wrote on Twitter. ‚ÄúChina using access to market as leverage to crush free speech globally.‚Äù
And i'm fine with that.

I've been waiting for blizzard to be taken down a peg or two.
Devil's advocate here, but why do they have to respond to something that is clearly stated in the ToS?
No1 cares
They put out an apology.

To China.
There are more PC gamers in China than there are people in the entire United States.  I don't think you guys are getting the outcome you're hoping for.
I‚Äôm glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family‚Äôs organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
If people are actually wanting to hurt them, don't delete your account and quit. Just stop spending money. Play the free to play games you already paid for. Just don't spend anything at all on them. Uninstall anything costs money to play.

Why not use up their server resources and get your money's worth out of them? And then some. The more cycles you burn in their data centers without paying them anything, the greater the impact to their bottom line. 

Running game servers is not free. Use that against them if you want to make a greater impact.
Blizz apology drinking game, bottoms up for each of the following

‚ÄúLet us say this: we hear you.‚Äù (nope)

‚ÄúWe need to do better‚Äù (they wont)

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll work harder to make our policies clear to everyone‚Äù (they wont)

‚ÄúWhile we appreciate the conversation that has been taking place‚Äù (they dont)

‚ÄúWe will never forget our core values and mission‚Äù (they already did)

‚ÄúMoving forward...‚Äù (everyone move along, back to business as usual)
I wonder which Overwatch Character they'll try to retcon to gay, trans or non-binary to cover this all up.

They did it in the past, chances are they'll try it again.
Your answer infuriates me, because I know you are right and it makes me realize also how things are not going to change and they will remain this money grabbing greedy entity that won't ever cease to exist. At least as long as the same people remain in charge.
Blizzard DID apologize, but just to China: https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfkmp1/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/
An apology would piss the fuck out of China though, and that's all the matters.

They wouldn't be able to use blizzard as propaganda anymore.
At this point I don't think anything but a full pull-out from China would satisfy anyone.
Any apology will be a condemnation of china, and even if not released in china will doom blizzard there. They can't have two differing messages for different territories.
Safe money on them using the phrase "In the future" or "Moving Forward" without doing ANYTHING to rectify the current situation.
[deleted]
Form response apologies are always transparent.

Might as well lead with "so our lawyers wrote this for us..."
I am thoroughly pissed at Blizzard but this I don‚Äôt buy. I doubt almost anyone feels good about this decision outside of Blizzard Taiwan.

They do have a lot to make up for though, and reversing all the decisions is just a start. What they should do now is provide material assistance to Hong Kong and openly take the right side.
Their stock has barely even dropped
I won‚Äôt accept anything less than a brutally honest apology with them admitting how cowardly they are.
So they either post one and it's viewed as PR bullshit and the outrage brigade marches on or they don't post one at all and the outrage brigade marches on.

Is it any wonder companies don't listen to their fan base when those are the sorts of options presented to them?
Bobby Kotick apologizing ....... yeah that's not going to happen
The stocks are coming down already. They lost (just) 2$ in 2 days. If we keep up the pressure more and more investors will abandon ship and the stocks will fall
Their currently doing the math on how far they can maintain Chinese support while minimizing losses in the US.
Short of them prostrating themselves,  Blitzchung a million bucks, and declaring themselves for HK and opponents of the Chinese state, it's not going to get better.

It's not like some gaming companies where they sell single-player games. Blizzard games are all about the community... it's a big market to milk but you don't declare war on it.
Why apologize when the majority of their consumers are from China? They‚Äôll just try and let it blow over.
If they apologize, reinstate the people involved, and promise to respect American* values, that would let a lot of us who want to go back to classic WoW do so ethically.

\* ^(We can argue about what that means, but you get the idea.)
Apologies mean shit, I want action.
I doubt there will be an apology.

Frankly, Blizzard has very little interest in a western market. They‚Äôre making Diablo Immortal a phone game simply because Chinese people are addicted to them and pour money into micro transactions. That‚Äôs why Blizzard is deep throating China‚Äôs dick.
Did they apologize? I'm seeing tons of pro-Blizzard posts on Weibo and I believe that Blizzard might have something to do with the Chinese propaganda department.

Because state-run media is praising Blizzard for what they did, and criticizing the NBA as a negative example.
This is gonna seriously fuck with Blizzcon. If you think their wont be people silently protesting with shirts or questions etc etc, then i think people will be in for a huge surprise.
[They apologized to China](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfjldg/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/)
Are you the meme gatekeeper?

I'm the meme keymaster.
I see what you did there
I hope so too.
Sending my energy to make this a reality.
Everybody in attendance should have air horns and blast them at random times during every event.
Blizzard is staying silent because they're hoping this will all blow over and gamers will forget about it. Don't let that happen.

Keep their games uninstalled. Keep #BoycottBlizzard trending. Keep the Mei Hong Kong memes coming. *And most importantly, don't let them forget what they've done.*
Which senators?
Do you have a link? Preferably to a translated version?
That was netease, not Blizzard.
Because not responding is the best response. There's literally nothing Blizzard can do or say that would be beneficial to them in the long run. If you condemn your actions then you run the risk of losing your Chinese demographic (a demographic so large that it prevented the WoW movie from being a complete flop). The sad reality is that Blizzard can risk losing a tiny bit of their western audience in the long run.
How would your presser read? Bearing in mind either ccp or western market is going to be alienated no matter what you do since both are actively demanding you take action against the other
Not with that attitude.
No they didn't, that's Netease not Blizzard..
Oh you mean like when EA screwed up so bad with Star wars that actual law makers even in other countries have started making anti loot box laws? That totally blew over.
On the other hand, internet outrage forced Google to pull out of their big project to help China censor the internet. It's been 10 years and still no deal between the two. Google did try to sneak back in quietly with Dragonfly but that, too, got shut down.

So no, real change is possible if enough people stay pissed off and stick to their guns. If it can happen to Google it can sure as shit happen with e-sports.
No no no no, the last twenty seven thousand internet outrages weren't real, this one is different!
100% FALSE.

when blizzard tried to make using their REAL ID system with your literal real first and last name as your account name, everyone flipped out, called blizzard (i did) and demanded they change the policy.

they did, its now entirely optional and changed to "real id *friends*"

they do listen, they do change, but now?  

all i have for blizzard is a loss of confidence.
I only wished it were happening sooner
What should I use next time
I wonder how long it'll be?
Well, I wont be playing any of their games anymore, and I'm somebody, and I dont consider myself anybody special so I think a lot of other somebodys will also do as me, and that's something.
>The subscriptions will come back after the karma farming ends

Mine will never. I already quit 1 game that began bending over backwards to Chinese dick (Path of Exile) and right after doing so it became a total shitfest and I lost all and any interest in playing. Just like I lost all interest in Blizzard's games.

In fact I'm seriously thinking of dropping gaming altogether, seems like there are far more productive ways of spending my time than trying to figure out which game dev doesn't (yet) support a genocidal regime.
fan since the 90's here.

i have 10k matches of sc2.

i dont play anymore.
The billionaire who had Bobby Kotick in his little black book of pedos, in case anyone forgot.
You can't unsubscribe or boycott a secret pedo ring, you can with Blizzard. Look at what Epic put out recently. Blizz's competitors are already circling like vultures to take advantage of this little fracas. The market is speaking.
His name is Epstein, none of us forgot, he's dead.

If you're suggesting blizzard is going to fold up and die then yeah you're right, people will stop caring.

Hong kong has been in the news, even here in America, consistently since the protests started. An American company acting favorably towards China and against a HK protester is not going to disappear.

The frenzy will die down. But people will not have forgot of this, especially by Blizzcon on the 1st.
Yea sure like a bilion dollar company is going to buy out the most important gaming market. Us player base in total of every game is 1/4 of the chinese player base, and there are a lot of people who live and jobs depend on blizzard games in eu and us that are going to keep playing blizzard games, this change nothing and inaction is action, this thing is gonna blow over in 2 monts
> anything short of buying out the Chinese investment will ring hollow to me. For now, the silence is deafening.

The Chinese investment isn't even the important part. It's the revenue they make from China and their expansion into that market. They wanted more growth, China was the place they feel they could get it.
Indeed. And the best option in that situation is just pick a fuckin side. 

If they want to be a Chinese company, godspeed. Let them pack up their offices, move to China and start producing shitty mobile games to make whales addicted. Until the CCP decides to steal all their intellectual property and boot them back to the US on some pretense, while keeping all their equipment and facilities of course.
only if you let it
I'm disappointed too, but I get it.  They're walking on eggshells here.  An insufficient response will just make things worse for them in the West, and any significant mea culpa could destroy their relationship with China.  

Their response will be out "when it's ready", just like old-times Blizzard.
I feel like this is the longest i've seen a company not get out in front of an issue like this. I hope their stock tanks some more and people keep cancelling their accounts.
Yeah, a lot of PR speak and no actual apology, change or restitution for the 3 employees they fucked over. That's a safe bet.
China, unfortunately.

Chinese gamers spend $$$ on MTX like drunken sailors in a whorehouse finally getting shore leave after it was delayed twice and don't give half a shit about the quality of games like the West (or Japan/Korea) does.
Its simple really... They dont know what to fucking do. They cant/wont cut ties with China and bite the hand that feeds them. and they are getting publicly fucked the world over.. I guess they are just going to have to lose one or the other.. Since China is a whopping 14% of their earnings I think we all know where they side.. 

And yes I am a shareholder and I am fucking pissed becaus enot only did I lose money. but it was the worst possible way. By the company I trusted backhanding Democracy and America. Shame on them.
Sadly, we all know that isnt going to happen. I dont know what they are going to do. But it wont be cutting ties with China.. Too much is already invested. Diablo Immortal anyone?
And I tried [posting that to this subreddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dfm5ow/blizzards_official_weibo_account_just_posted_an/), but for some reason it never showed up in /r/Blizzard/new/
A single corporation is easier to tackle than an entire dictatorship. And it sends a message, Blizzard is made an example of for other companies (or their shareholders) to look at. Damaging Blizzards reputation over this will have a bigger effect than just harming Blizzard. Isolating and weakening China‚Äôs economy will take time, but will do a hell of a lot more than ‚Äòmaking statements‚Äô
Well played
Time will tell, friend
I know I didn't but I wanted a dapper frog sipping some tea so Kermit had to do
If Blizzard is owned by Activision, wouldnt this kind of order had to of come from Activision? Or does Activision let their owned assets do what they please?
Activision already fucked Modern Warfare on their own. They had possibly the best CoD in a decade or more on their hands, and they pissed it away for greed and MTXs.
Oh please, they're not going to cancel it
I wouldn't exactly say it is "clearly stated", I think the rule is extremely broad, and they chose to apply it in this way.  As Mark Kern, the lead dev for vanilla WoW, said: "It‚Äôs one thing to keep politics out of games, which I am still a proponent of doing. It‚Äôs another to unfairly and harshly punish voices that speak out against corruption, against abuses of human rights, and freedom."
Damage control.

Look around, there are countless cancelled subs to WOW for example.
You keep making these broad and sweeping statements, have any sort of actual numbers or stats to back this up? And having more anything doesn't directly translate to more profit.  Not everything in the world is directly proportional.

&#x200B;

Edit: Since you don't seem interested in self educating I'll lend a hand. There is some truth to what you're saying, the industry is certainly MASSIVE in China, and in fact there are more PC gamers there than there are people in the US. But that stat alone doesn't provide a lot of insight into the market there. So lets break it down a little. For reference, China PC game revenue was about 16 billion, which is over half of the 30 billion that the US gaming industry made from all platforms (console, PC, Mobile) combined.

&#x200B;

The gaming market there is very different from the Western market. In Chine, not a lot of Western games see wide spread success with the exception of PUBG. The major markey goliaths are free to play, Chinese developed games i.e. Ring of Alysium, Fantasy Westward Journey and Westward Journey 2, Perfect World, etc. There are 2 main reasons for this, nationalism (China good, everyone else bad), and because in the early 2000's China banned all consoles and console video games, PC games however were not banned. (Not sure what the reasoning was or if it was just oversight of the Chinese government here.) At the time in China computers and computer parts were extremely expensive, and so resource light and free to play titles rose to be the kings of the land.

&#x200B;

Within this genre you also have to acknowledge the success of esports titles in Chine, think League of Legends and Starcraft 2, esports games alone account for 6 billion of the 16 billion dollars of revenue generated by PC gaming in China. Which are both free to play. (Starcraft 2 having gone free to play on 11/14/17, so before the 2018 earning stats were compiled.) Another factor that likely played a large part in the success of these games is that Riot is 100% owned by Tencent and they also have a 5% stake in Blizzard. Tencent is a major gaming giant in China and has an incredible amount of influence over the market there.

&#x200B;

Now that we've covered how different the markets are, lets take a moment to talk about how that relates to Blizzard. To put it bluntly, Blizzard is hardly a gaming giant in that market. During the last revenue report for the company, the US accounted for 55% of the companies profit, while China represented 15%. The US dwarfs China in revenue when it comes to this particular company. With that said, 15% is no small number when you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars. So with so much more of their revenue coming from the west why would they risk losing some of that? To put it simply, they gambled and lost, or at least it's looking that way, we can't no for sure until their next revenue call. ( [https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-second-quarter-2019-financial](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-second-quarter-2019-financial) )

&#x200B;

This bit is going to be my interpretation of events, not facts, so grain of salt and all. I think Blizzard took a risk, it's no secret that China is pretty quick to ban sources of entertainment from foreign companies if they find that it doesn't conform to their standards, and Blizzard knew that, and they didn't want that. They knew if they took a hard stance on this China wouldn't crack down on them, likely fully aware that their would be Western backlash, but not enough to account for the potential 15% dip they would see if China blocked them out. At least that's what they believed, but reality may play out differently. The West and specifically the US may be very divided right now, but if there's one thing that can pull everyone together it's the suppression of democracy and human rights, especially when committed by a domestic company.

&#x200B;

I was bored at work and felt like writing a documentary. Don't @ me. (lol at me thinking anyone will read this far.)

&#x200B;

tldr: Blizzard took a calculated risk in an effort to appease Chinese censorship, and might have lost.

You almost had me for a second there, comrade.
Whales only spend money because of the free to play people, do not play their games
Active monthly users is a huge metric for valuation
By playing a multiplayer game you generate content for other players (yourself as an opponent).

Even if you're only playing single player Diablo or Starcraft if suddenly lots of people stop opening the Blizzard launcher that sends a bigger message than people only playing single player games.
I am not for being destructive towards a business due to potential legal issues that would emerge.

But if I waaaas... file hosting can be pretty expensive as well. Downloading to ram and dumping it could, in theory, cost them some miniscule amount of money. Depending on how load balancing works it might also disrupt their other services hosted out of the same network.

I would not suggest doing this. It is very likely illegal where you live to intentionally disrupt normal operations of a business.
Ill do both.
Quitting the account shows the intent right now and makes it WAY more easy to pull through with it
Having a playerbase to show to their investors and shareholders is going to be more valuable than server costs, so... don't play any of them.
Not only that but you could try to set standards about how cancerous the community is...
This is so on the money it's hysterical. This is like the standard template of very broad meaning words that convey a sense of you reading an apology letter but in fact they never actually apologise or even refer to what they're they're trying to apologise for.
Can I print that to play with my friends ?
"It was not our intention..." - Classic Apology 101

They could have said any of the above by now and haven't. 
Why?
The Mark Zukerburg defense does work sometimes *unfortunately*
This won't be much fun, because Blizzard ain't putting out any more statements. It'll be radio silence until who knows when. I don't even think they'll talk about it at Blizzcon

Everyone's a gangster until actual profits are on the line. Then all this socially aware bullshit that corporations try to feed us gets exposed for the mere lipservice it always was.
I believe that's called a Rowling.
It's a fundamental problem with capitalism. Corporations need money to survive, so they will always bow to who the money comes from, whether that's the CCP or outraged consumers. Shifting the field so that supporting human rights is more profitable doesn't make companies fundamentally ethical.

We should make games ourselves, leave the shits behind.
Which explains why theyve been absolutely silent. Anything they say will cause either americans or chinese fans and government to be pissed off. But if they say nothing they will continue to get shat on. A PR nightmare you could legit use as a case study for someones masters thesis.
Englishman here. I cancelled WoW, uninstalled 3 other games; will not buy anything from Blizzard again.
Not just America though. This is EU too. 

I hope the eastern markets not controlled by China are speaking out too.
I'm from Germany
Of course it's a 'financially sound decision'. The reason it is sound is because the West doesn't punish for bad behavior that we don't like, but China absolutely punishes everything they don't like. So in the end they upset the west but nothing happens so they can appease China. 

So, it needs to be made a financially unsound decision. We need to force them to not do business with a country that oppresses its people, that stops free speech, that puts people in concentration camps and harvest their organs, that demands companies that work with them follow its direction. While it is certainly a good thing to boycott these companies ourselves, we need governmental action. These companies entire existence is in the end owed to America and the west enforcing its rules and norms. Multinational companies are basically children who like to think they are adults until dad gets home and starts taking off the belt, and it's about damn time. Yes, it will cause short term harm and the companies will scream the entire time while we're doing this but it's the right decision. China has had a free hand this century as America turned inward and we -- America and the rest of the West -- needs to put her in her place. Our current solutions to try and bring about change in China have only strengthened and emboldened the communist party, which is now literally committing genocide.

These things are all symptoms of serious problems that will require government action. Yes, we can boycott activision-blizzard, or the NBA, or whomever kowtows to China. But that does not address the ultimate problems. We need to be lobbying politicians to really take it to China hard. Forbid companies from doing business in America if they do business in a country that suppresses freedom of speech, for example.
Give it time. Remember that the majority of stockholders are not gamers or plugged in to the gaming community. The news hasn't hit them yet, the *outrage* hasn't hit them yet. Once the story gets around, you'll see that stock plummet, hopefully.
Well now Overwatch is banned in China, so...
Nobody in the US is arguing that it isn't a financially sound decision.  They are arguing that Blizzard made a financially sound decision over the morally correct one.

I think your assumptions on what Americans are thinking are objectively incorrect.
This is about more than america vs china, its core western values of freedom of thought and expression vs repression, authoritarianism and censorship. Everyone, from the people in this comments thread to the CEOs calling the shots has an inescapable moral duty to stand up for our values and stop taking shit from the CCP. Shit on America all you want but you have exactly the same conundrum as us. Better decide where you stand soon.
Awhh poor baby I'm upset
Thry already fucked up.
They killed all good options for this themselves.
Yup.

"gameplay first" my ass
They're not tho: https://www.statista.com/statistics/269665/activison-blizzards-revenue-by-region/
They don't need it to blow over to be honest. If they release a cool game, 99% of consumers will still buy it.
The reinstatement is the key.

Corporate apologies are meaningless, as evidenced by the fact they all use the same tropes.

Tropes and sincerity aren't very compatible
That's the only apology I'd accept, love it.

FTFY
Pretty sure the Chinese market is much more enticing to them than their American audience tbh. I wouldn't be surprised at all if they completely avoid the controversy.
> promise to respect American* values

r/ShitAmericansSay
I think you're looking for the term "Liberal Values".
Betraying morality for profit is the most American thing you can do, my guy.
Yeah they apologized for the statements made by the Hearthstone player and they will defend the pride and dignity of China at all costs. So they have stated they support the totalitarian government and are against the people of Hong Kong.
Yeah, this makes me damn excited, I'm so happy that gamers are uniting over a cause like this. HELL YES.
You really think they will let people ask questions this year?
Now kith

No, because it isn't true. What he's referring to was a post by Netease on Weibo. Blizzard still hasn't said anything.
Step 1: force ceo to step down and fire everyone involved.

Step 2: undo the ban, etc.

Step 3: release public apology, assure everyone that blizzard is proud of its employees who stand for human rights, etc, and that everyone involved in this has been removed. Be careful to not explicitly support Hong Kong, emphasis that blizzard is not a political organization and is compromised of people of many beliefs and ideologies.

Step 4: have a closed door meeting with your chinese investors and suck as many metaphorical dicks as needed. 

Step 5: don‚Äôt worry about the opinions of the chinese general public - their internet is so heavily censored they‚Äôll hear about this anyway.

Step 6: quietly wait for the next outrage to happen when everyone will forget about this whole thing.
Yea, this is by no means easy from a pure business standpoint, although it is easy from a moral standpoint. Arguably, Blizzard is in a rougher position than the NBA.
It's still the official hearthstone account not Netease. Blizzard licenses the game, they surely have control over this.
I can't even remember how long it has been since I last purchased an EA game.  The only exceptions might have been something that came in a humble bundle along the way, but an actual EA game I purchased on its own has to be at least five or more years old now.
Except that EA is doing all right, still trying to introduce greedy mechanics whenever they can. Nestle is doing fine, Facebook is recovering. Net neutrality doesn't look good with the recent court ruling. And this probably will mean nothing by the next week or so.
[imgur.com](https://imgur.com) its free, easy to use, and no stupid watermark. dont support anyone with a watermark. (by spreading their name)
I never would've guessed over 24 hours.  It's hard to imagine no response by close of business Friday (today).  Yet part of me thinks it could be deep into the weekend or early next week until we hear something official.
The gaming community's outrage seems to be more legit than the typical news cycle screecher's.
what did PoE do?
You could just not bring politics into your hobby as well
Because of this scandal?
interesting, got a [source] for that claim?
FYI, Asian revenue was roughly 12% of Blizzard's takings, last call.  If they take a big enough hit to non-Asian revenue through cancellations, they WILL write off that income.
No doubt the Chinese revenue is important to Blizzard, and perhaps of utmost importance. And the Chinese investment may not be THE important part, but i don't think we can dismiss it as AN important part. 

I would not be at all surprised if some of the Asian market infrastructure was being run buy Blizzard's Asian partner companies. How high up the chain did the Blitzchung matter get before a decision was sent back down? Did that verdict come from US executives, well aware of the knots that the NBA had tied itself up in at that very moment, or did the decision come from the partners, also well aware of the NBA situation.

Unfortunately for Blizzard, they find themselves in an untenably imbalanced relationship. While Tencent only owns 10% of the company, that 10% appears to be a controlling interest. While we don't know the behind the scenes, what everyone sees is 'Blizzard' doing what Tencent wants them to do. If Tencent gets what they want in this case, they will keep going until they find the line Blizzard won't cross, and it may well be too late. 

Blizzard cares very much about their relationship with Tencent, because of the potential revenue down the line. They want the money. Tencent doesn't give a flying fuck about Blizzard. And as an unofficial arm of the government they don't care about money, either. They want control. I'm sure Blizzard execs would much rather that China was an open market where the strength (ymmv) of their games was enough to insure market position. I'm sure that they would rather not be partners with Tencent, and would rather keep all that revenue to themselves. But to get the access they played the game, and now they have had their first hint of how that game ends. It won't be the last. Whoever made the Blitzchung decision is definitely handing over notes on how the American University team should be handled. 

Blitzchung was an incident, but by flinching (and at this point Blizzard hasn't just flinched, but curled into a fetal position) Blizzard is opening the floodgates to everyday censorship. China is going to keep asking for more, and will that Chinese revenue ever materialize, or will it always be just over the horizon, always 12% and forecast to go up next year because Tencent decided to push their own game instead? China isn't going to help Blizz or Riot or Epic, they are going to use them. 

So yeah, Blizz wants all that revenue, but to get access to it they had to partner with a company that has completely different goals and would leave Blizzard's corpse in a gutter to prove a point. This may have just become clear to them. 

On an even playing field, maximizing revenue/profit is the 'right' thing for a corporation to do in a capitalist environment. But no playing field is ever truly level, and an ability to navigate that uneven terrain is what separates the good execs from the bad.
They don't have to cut ties, they just need to say something. The NBA was able to make a statement (on their second attempt) that took a stand while still extending a hand to China. I don't see why Blizzard can't do the same thing. 

There was an opinion piece in Bloomberg that argued that the NBA isn't at that much risk in China because it's too popular and the people will circumvent any blocks put in place by the government. I wonder if ot's possible that Blizzard could also be insulated to some extent. Particularly because, unlike the NBA, Blizzard doesn't *need* a physical presence.
[deleted]
Agreed. I hope it hurts them badly.
Blizzard is about 5 percent Chinese, good move.

Try.. i dont know, Tencent, the phone game producer with hundreds of games actively against the Hong Kong movement? Bet you have games they made on your phone!
I still gave an upvote, the message is more important
According to Wikipedia, Blizzard owners Vivendi still maintains control.

>" Around 2006, Kotick reached out to [Jean-Bernard L√©vy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Bernard_L%C3%A9vy), the CEO of the French media conglomerate [Vivendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi). Vivendi at that time had a small games division, [Vivendi Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vivendi_Games), a holding company principally for [Sierra Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment) and [Blizzard Entertainment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard_Entertainment). Kotick wanted to get access to Blizzard's [*World of Warcraft*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft), a successful MMO, and suggested a means to acquire this to L√©vy. L√©vy instead offered that he would be willing to merge Vivendi Games with Activision, but only if Vivendi kept majority control of the merged company. According to those close to Kotick, Kotick was concerned about this offer as it would force him to cede control of Activision. However, after talking to Blizzard's CEO [Mike Morhaime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Morhaime), Kotick recognized that Vivendi would be able to give them inroads into the growing video game market in China.[\[15\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activision_Blizzard#cite_note-forbes_kotick-15) "

Cancel it all? No.

I can see all the Q&A segments being completely cut or cancelled though.
Good, shitstorm it is then.
"Countless".
This is a good point, but does not apply in all cases. For example, if somebody is playing D3 solo, whales are not spending money because of that. There are cases where you can cost them money by using their servers.
Install a boy that only playa tavern brawl with a friend!
Does that metric generate value? Not if the users aren't paying for anything.
Exactly. We‚Äôre in for the classic abuser‚Äôs ‚Äúapology‚Äù of ‚ÄúIm sorry if you found what i did hurtful‚Äù without actually admitting wrongdoing. At most they will apologize for not communicating better about what they were doing to us players ‚Äî also known as ‚Äúits your fucking fault for being too dumb to realize we‚Äôre in the right, now shut up and keep giving us your money‚Äù.

The only thing that blizz can do to fix this imo is undo the ban, undo the firings, give back the prize money and make a REAL apology which explains exactly what theyll be doing to respect freedom of expression for oppressed people who are under threat and fighting for their rights. But of course we arent going to be getting any of that because blizz wants to make shitty yet profitable exploitative skinner-box mobile games for chinese markets.
Btw lets remind ppl that many of the points made here were poibted out from time to time in varius subs...

Its been a long time to listen to the community...

Seems nothing will change
Sure although you may want to add some lines depending on how much you usually drink. 6 guaranteed drinks wont be enough for some.
Genuine fear of reprisal from China if they apologize or back down in any way. 

Internal conflict over whether to side with usa and western markets after all.

Trying to negotiate an out with China behind closed doors or work something out with the player/casters (the latter is somewhat doubtful).

Just general panic/incompetence and terror of making a bad situation worse - which is *always* a possibility.

Take your pick. My vote is a combination of all 4. 

If they are extremely dumb then they are waiting and hoping it will all blow over but honestly not even a company in decline like blizz is that dumb. With blizzcon coming up blizz is in for a total PR shitstorm if they dont appease their ‚Äúcore players‚Äù (westerners).. so we cannot go much longer without a response from blizz unless the company really is on the verge of just totally imploding.

I almost feel sorry for blizzard because the timing just happened to line up in such a way that they have no good move, including doing nothing. They are fucked almost no matter what.
I doubt they'll be able to not talk about it at blizzcon.  I certainly hope that many attendees will be wearing Hong Kong flag shirts under outer shirts and such, ready to reveal at inconvenient times.
Hopefully the majority of Blizzcon attendees don‚Äôt give them the option to be silent about it. I want everyone at Blizzcon to be there for the sole purpose of trolling/protesting. This company needs to be made an example of.

Loool the classic ‚Äúim sorry you were offended (not sorry for what i did)‚Äù
I mean, you're joking but Bastion having a relationship with anyone would be kinda interesting since he can only communicate in "beeps" and "boops".

It could be a nice allegory of a deaf and mute person trying to experience love. But alas, we'll probably never get something well thought out like that from Blizzard.
A Blizzard Employee, Jules Murillo-Cueller to be exact, got racially profiled, treated like a "punching bag", was diagnosed with clinical depression as a result, and apparently considered suicide (with at least one unsuccessful attempt). Shortly after he went public with this, or even at the same day even, Blizzard made the "76 is Gay" announcement.

EDIT: Apparently Murillo went public in *response* to Blizzard Virtue-Signaling, not the other way around. The two events happened.so close to one another, I kinda mixed it up.
Yea it was 76 and it was for the whole Diablo Immortal/"Don't you guys have phones?" fiasco.
Part of me shares your cynicism but the other part is hopeful that the huge reaction from fans shitting on blizzard WILL have an impact and cause them to rethink their behavior and complicity with the CCP. Maybe american consumers can reign in our corporations. It worked with google (at least for a time, we‚Äôll see if they try to resume helping china censor stuff in the future).
Ok I actually Lol'd at this one
Oh but thats where you're wrong they haven't been silent. They made a public apology to china, yes to **china**.
until the next diablo or the next blizzard game? Between you and me... We all know when everybody around you will play the next game from blizzard you will be with the sheeps too...

Gamers doesnt have any principle, except when there is an outrage, and then they forgot about it.
[deleted]
Very well said and entirely correct.
You're going to quickly find out that nothing can be done because the entire planet's manufacturing base has more or less been moved to countries that engage in these sorts of abuses.    Not that I don't agree with you in principle.
Quick follow up questions: How do you feel about workers rights, and also, where was your computer made?

Where do you stand when it comes actually inconveniencing yourself vs just not playing a few specific games?
But that's exactly my point. It's 2 days since the event blew up and if people are already saying "it's too late, there's no coming back from this" why should they even bother? Why expend the effort?

For people that think like that, no amount of good will or trust building from Blizzard is going to work, so why even bother addressing the situation again? People will burn their discs, unsub and then the outrage will shift somewhere else in a week or twos time when some other company does something shitty.
That's because they haven't released a mobile game \[specifically meant to capture the Chinese market\] yet.  \[We'll have to wait and see the impact of CoD (not competing with Fortnite) and Diablo (actually directed at China), but that's not on these numbers.\]

Edit: For everyone trying to take me out of context.
I disagree.  These days there are too many cool games that most people don't have time for them all.  You can have a never-ending supply of good gaming without ever having to touch Blizzard, EA, etc.  Sure, some people will fold if Blizzard puts out the next cool game, but it's becoming easier and easier to stick to your guns, and that means more people will choose to.
I want them to admit their cowardice. No spin. Come out and admit that they sold out their morals for Chinese money and beg for the world‚Äôs forgiveness.
I want more than just a reversal because "we didn't think people would get this upset." There needs to be some form of reparations as well, such as a donation to a relevant charity.
China is not even a 1/5th of their current market. This is entirely because if they go against the CCP they get banned completely. But if they go against human rights they get a boycott but still operate openly.

The only real solution here is US gov sanctions on China. Blizzard and other companies need the US government to flex its muscles against China to even the field.
With even us senators breathing down their neck? If they dont get their ass in gear and address this soon they may get regulated out of China entirely. Wasnt long ago that chinese werent allowed to own stake in US companies. You know you fucked up when even the likes of republican legislators and their fatcat lobbyist handlers in washington are affronted at your unethical behavior
It's well past the point of 'avoiding controversy' if they wanted to avoid controversy they wouldn't have issues an apology to china and essentially told the rest of the world to suck it.
I'm absolutely not.  Way too much baggage implied there no matter how you *want* to try to define that.
Who says they have to "let" anyone. Smuggle in a bullhorn to ask. I'm sure it can be done somehow with enough bribery money to someone watching doors. Thena gain i've never been to a blizzcon so im probably talking out of my ass.
Rerorerorerorerorero
That's Netease, not Blizzard.
They could do that... if it werent blatantly obvious blizz had explicit orders from its chinese partner NetEase to come down hard on the player and casters. They cant undo that without pissing off the CCP but its required to make the ‚Äúapology‚Äù genuine. Catch22
No, it's Netease not Blizzard. You don't gain control over a company just because you license a game to them. Take TERA as an example. Bluehole Studios has no control over what Gameforge, Naver or NHN does. Just like Blizzard has no control over what Netease does.
Sadly that kind of defeatism (while also being wrong and claiming things without any proof) is an epidemic that needs to be cured. Its one of the biggest issues of our generation.
I agree. CCP censors gaining control over the gaming industry directly effects my quality of life, so of course I actually give a shit.
I think that's because theres something immediate that most of us can do in this situation, which is, stop using their services and products, since well, those are just games so we wont lose anything truly important or convenient
Tencent owns 80% of GGG.
It's far easier to do so in hobbies that do not involve such huge sums of money as gaming does.

There are other factors I've considered too and ultimately gaming is just a huge waste of time for absolutely no gain whatsoever. I could start painting and eventually become good enough to earn money from it. The chance that happens with gaming, while it is there, is astronomically low.
yes, exactly
5 seconds of google will do it for you.
Well good luck keeping WoW afloat without the chinese Money 70% of WoW player base is Chinese, and i think your estimation of 12% is wrong but i dont have the exact numbers so it doesnt matter, Blizzard didn't have any other choise, they could have been a little less harsh on the punishment, but in reality it doesnt matter that much, company when push cone to shove they are gonna always chose profit
$.70 is pretty significant.
I am expecting it to dip further.

No I didnt sell therefore I know I technically didnt lose money but I was purchasing from way back at 74 and it has never fully recovered. The last annual report boasted gains from e-sports. Well... considering this is at the center.. I am not so sure. Also with this whole Allegeance to China vs US stuff going one I am not sure how they will rebound... I am in no rush to sell. But I can usually see some kind of path to recovery.. Here.. not so much.
See you‚Äôre still not looking at the big picture. You‚Äôre looking at ways to directly and immediately affect it, this is a longer process. The idea here is make an example of Blizzard because of their actions, it sends the message that no matter the size of the company, there‚Äôll be pushback and hopefully it‚Äôs the starting point of more companies getting torn down because of it. It‚Äôs a mixture of economy and influence, not one or the other. And it‚Äôll be a long ass process
I wasn‚Äôt speaking literally but sure.
Count em then
Make a few dozen f2p accounts on virtual machines?
It...it does make sense...hmmm
If it generates investors it generates value.
Blizz should have just come out with a blanket statement and distance themselves without agreeing or disagreeing with anything

something mundane and boring like

Blizzard prides ourselves with our core values and respect peoples opinions. We are proud that our platforms reach such a broad and diverse audience. With this diverse audience it is important to keep our message related to the games that we play and out of political or other unrelated topics. It is important to remember that we abide by all laws in the countries that we operate in. Happy gaming.

Punishment should have been disqualification from that one specific tournament, not banned from any for a year, and let him keep his winnings.
Well you drink every time you hear each phrase, they'll be uttered more than once I'm sure lol.
[deleted]
Terror and incompetence sounds about right - they are probably taking a look at how the NBA's actions has caused reprisals by China. 

At least their stock price is taking a hit.
I anticipate that there will be plenty of such attempts, but Blizzard isn't changing their stance so they're just going to avoid talking about the issue. I feel they will try their best to deal with the jeering and taunting, and cancel any Q&As to avoid giving any protesters a microphone. 

Still will be a good show though
More like "please I need your money I'll say whatever you want to hear to get it back short of actually admitting to any wrongdoing".
Non-binary too, since you know... he's an AI/robot.

But yeah, assuming Blizzcorp would even dare SUGGEST something like that is thinking too highly of them.
Insultingly lazy, too.  Like, they didn't even make a *new* character that the community could relate to or had some sort of *relevance* or *connection* to LGBT rights.

They just pointed at random to the character lineup and said, "that one there, that one likes dudes.  You're welcome." 

Tokenism at it's finest.
Blizzard's censuring of Blitzchung is contemptible, but this is just pitchfork waving. Jules's entire blogpost was a rebuttal to one of his coworkers accusing him of being sexist towards her (without hearing her side of the story at all), and includes such memorably convincing moments as his wife yelling,  [‚ÄúGTFO inside, can‚Äôt you see you‚Äôre triggering him.‚Äù](https://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sqp7gi) because his coworkers were asking him to come inside instead of crying and screaming outside their office building. 

This was all delivered with Jules's advertising for his upcoming book.
What I find funny is that the page where you delete your account was updated yesterday...  
Oh... And you need to show them your Government ID to delete your account...  


Something doesn't smell right.
> Shortly after he went public with this, or even at the same day even, Blizzard made the "76 is Gay" announcement.

I just looked into this, if this source is correct then I think you have the order of events reversed:

https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-01-09-former-blizzard-employee-alleges-racism-and-discrimination-drove-him-to-leave

>Murillo-Cueller finishes by adding his decision to share his story was in part triggered by this week's revelation that Overwatch character Soldier 76 is gay, continuing Blizzard's long-running stance that the multiplayer shooter can be a beacon of diversity.

This makes a little more sense imo.
They'll rethink their stance with the CCP... If it turns out to be more profitable to rethink it.
Link it so I can read it bro
That was in a different territory, and it was for china. I'm not saying don't read it, but you know who it was intended for. Now to not compromise that message, the best damage control message to the west they can send is silence.
Probably gonna get downvoted for this just like you, but here goes:

I suspect a lot of the people on this subreddit posting about how they cancelled WoW or deleted their accounts, even posting "proof" via the message that conveniently says they can still cancel it within the next few days, do just that. Cancel the deletion of their accounts, or resub, right after they've reaped that sweet reddit karma.

I'm not gonna say gamers don't have any principle, because being a gamer doesn't define who you are as a person. However just like any other group of human, people who game have a lot of assholes without principle. Selfish people who crave attention and whore themselves out for karma, not believing in what they post. So maybe a few of the people on here are being truthful about boicotting Blizzard, but I doubt many Blizzard fans will unless it affects them personally.
Project much? My close friends play CoD type games; I play these games because I enjoy them. My pride & principles > my desire to continue playing. I have a deep wallet and absolutely zero loyalty to a developer/publisher. I played the division, and when my friends tried to convince me to play the division 2, I said no. Still haven‚Äôt touched it.
This is the attitude Blizzard is counting on, that gamers will just forget controversy when the next bread and circus combo gets introduced. It's different this time, though. This time, it matters.
Not sure if you are a blind fanboy or even stupid AND blind fanboy.....

Heh, probably both.
Just because you're weak willed doesn't mean the rest of us are. Go be a small little man somewhere else.
For me it's an issue on general terms.

I don't just buy games. I also buy visions and values.

Blizzard started to look for me more like a moneymaker priority instead of gamer fun priority vision when the D3 auction house hit us and blizzard tried to make it work by brute force for way too long.

Since then I have felt less and less represented in my nerdy gamerness and kinship with what blizzard represent in the past.

And so this was just the end of a long decline.

And I don't see how this feeling is connected to any nationality?
Many countries buy and play Blizzard games. Many countries have people who are upset about the decision Blizzard made. This is literally an international situation. I mean Blizzard is in America and everything but there is no nationality tied to people being upset about what they did (unless they‚Äôre Chinese, but even then there‚Äôs probably plenty of people who support HK, just not outwardly)
Oh I know it has, and look at what it has wrought. Which is why there will be screaming the entire time, but it needs to happen.
Quick question for you: why is your participation in these issues revolve around telling people they arent ‚Äúreally‚Äù helping or dont ‚Äúreally‚Äù care about issues? I guess there is always some poisonous mentality pushed by the status quo that everyone who protests is actually just lazy and hypocritical, dont listen to them, theyre just punk kids who need to get jobs and so on. Makes it easy to keep people divided and suspicious of each other and fighting amongst themselves so that everything fizzles out.

Good luck to you, i wont waste my time and energy further trying to convince you of my sincerity. I know who I am and thats good enough for me. Enjoy the rest of your week.
Yea, they lost me, but they had it long coming. This was simply the last straw.

They might be able to salvage some hotheads though.
You mean like Hearthstone? Or Call of Duty Mobile? Or, you know, fucking *Candy Crush*?
Revenue growth 8% in the Americas and 6% in ALL of Asia Pacific (including lucrative markets of Japan and South Korea). China is a drop in the fucking bucket of their revenue, mobile game or no.
They just did. Cod
I bet you Blizzard is setting all sorts of financial records by simply bringing back old world of warcraft. If they release a Diablo game, it will probably make a shit ton too. As long as it isn't a mobile game again.
The US government has nothing to say about how Blizzard responds to an authoritarian government censoring its content around the world. 

Its Blizzards decision to either stay in the Chinese market and allow them police their content globally, or to tell them they aren't willing to play ball that way.
Even Ted Cruz has called out the NBA on this issue. You gotta be pretty far in the wrong for him to be on the right side of criticizing you.
I'm not using liberal in the same sense that it's used in modern American politics. What I'm talking about are the common values that the US was founded on (freedom, democracy, free speech, basically the bill of rights). This is not an uncommon use of the word liberal.
I dunno I just know if I was involved in a something as big as this, and I had a big event coming up that involved Q&A, Id make sure there was no Q&A
r/unexpectedjojo
Who're Activision-Blizzards partner in China. Anything they say, I'd say is on Activision-Blizzard too, especially if they keep their mouth shut still and say nothing themselves.
So you're saying that's not the official hearthstone account? 

edit: Ok more reading does show it's not the official hearthstone account, it's "NetEase's PlayHearthstone", so ok.

Even if that's the case it's not quite so simple, we don't know what kind of contracts were done in terms of what editing / publishing capacities Netease may have in representing hearthstone in an official manner.
Thats honestly an option regarding ANY outrage displayed towards a corporation, celebrity, or even in some cases politicians.

Gamer shut-ins just seem to have more legitimate values.  It's not about the social cred, but about legitimately being pissed at a betrayal.
It sounds like blizzard isn't losing you because of this "scandal" and it's more that you are using this as a reason to make a life change you've already been considering. So you wouldnt really fall into the category of people I'm talking about.
5 seconds of backing up your claims is on you, not on me.

you made the claim, you provide the proof.

this is called: Burden of Proof.
70% of the player base doesn't translate to 70% revenue. The stats are all over the place for you to view because Activision-Blizzard is publicly traded, but https://www.statista.com/statistics/269665/activison-blizzards-revenue-by-region/ should give you a bit of an idea what we're looking at - noting also that Asia-Pacific includes Oceania and other big-spender Asian nations that DGAF what China restricts, eg: Korea & the South East islands.   It varies by game, granted.  Hearthstone, for example, would be hit hard by losing China, as 30% of Hearthstone's revenue comes from there, but hanging on to that at the cost of global income elsewhere dropping from protest boycotting in other - more lucrative - games is a losing proposition.

For as long as they could have their cake and eat it too, being in China was a no-brainer.  But if China's going to put their foot down and make ActiBlizz decide between China and the rest of the world, ActiBlizz is going to choose the rest of the world. ...So long as the rest of the world does actually cancel/stop spending.  

I'm sure there are a lot of number crunchers in Blizz right now trying to figure out how much of a hit to their global reputation they can afford to take before having to write off Chinese money, or vice-versa.

So then again, you make an example of a company who did something like as number 300 in a line, but you only target them? Its silly mate. I apreciate your bigger picture but at the end of the day this does nothing compared to writing to a local politician or actions via amnesty international. This is just one thousand keyboard warriors destroying a company for barely a reason.
Yep. Don't delete unused accounts, instead leave the data on their servers forever. DB and file hosting aren't free.
Might've worked early on. But now I think it'll be too little, too late. Only way that pill goes down now is if they pair it with a Diablo 4 launch, lolz.
Careful dude, we dont want to send anyone to the hospital here
This is nothing. You shouldve seen us when they announced that diablo mobile game.
I dont even think one of those typical weak corporate pr-speak ‚Äúapologies‚Äù is going to cut it at this point - blizzard waited too long and let the player base work themselves into a frenzy. I legit cant wait to see what their next move is. We‚Äôre watching gaming history unfold.
Wouldnt he be be the definition of binary though? As he only thinks in ones and zeroes? Robot humor, am i right?
Something I'll NEVER issue to them.
Forcing you to have a government ID to get instantly removed is a good policy to prevent hackers from being able to delete everything they've ever bought from Blizzard just by gaining access to the account. Waiting 30 days with multiple warnings without one is a good security policy.
i have 3 separate accounts i need to delete, if anyone finds an answer on how to do this WITHOUT SUBMITTING ID, because FUUUUCK that. pls respond
So, basically he called out Blizzard for essentially acting like hypocrites, rather than Blizzard trying to cover it up? Yeah, that makes sense. I'll edit my post accordingly.
Which really puts the obligation on us to continue making life uncomfortable and unprofitable for blizz until they very publicly perform said rethinking.
Here ya go https://i.redd.it/3innty5cmjr31.jpg

Official response from Blizzard's Weibo account.
Yeah, and they're making a hugely political statement on an official Blizzard channel, representing the companies values and politics.

HMMMMM, SOUND FAMILIAR?
Easy to check that. Firstly, I‚Äôve had a reddit account for about a year and I‚Äôve posted once which was critical about the Chinese government; in fact , it‚Äôs a post about why I got banned from the Chinese subreddit (written incredibly badly, as I was about 7 pints into my night). I also have low karma (as far as I can tell), for an account that‚Äôs been around for little more than a year. I assure you that I‚Äôm being sincere.
Im not, but i know a lot of gamers here who say "i will not blah blah blah" are driven by emotion and when the cowards at blizz will release diablo4 or a new game, the same ppl who said that will buy the game anyway.

Same for those who cancelled their sub to wow. Give them a couple of week and they will re sub.
Like I said, I don't disagree with you in principle.  But there's a whole lot of consequences if your iPhone and your Playstation and your shoes and your canned peas are all made by people getting paid 15 usd/hour.
You're telling me it's my moral duty to do something, but refuse to answer a question regarding your moral authority.
None of which are directed at China, COD mobile isn't in those statistics, and isn't Candy Crush purely marketed at American and European women?
I'd wait and see 2019, 2020 numbers.  You're thinking about the past.  Activision is thinking about the future.
Is that popular in China?  Something tells me no.  Also, those numbers are 2007 to 2018.
Its not released in China yet.
Parts of the us govt has already weighed in, so this is false. The usa is not going to sit back forever while our corporations aid repression in china. Regulation will come down the pipes at some point given that both sides of the aisle are united in disdain over this
It's like siding with NAMBLA in a debate around age of consent. There's no possible way you come out as the good guy on that one.
Doesn't matter.  40% of the US population will see that word and instantly hate whatever idea it's *supposed to* represent.
That's not how that works. Tencent are partnered with both Discord and Reddit, so according to your fucked up logic anything Tencent does is Discord and Reddits fault as well.
"Ok, so according to the data we have, Blizzard didn't say anything. But I want to hate on Blizzard right now so I'm just going to pretend that Blizzard controls Neteases Weibo account and blame them over what Netease said."

That's literally what you sound like right now.
Well, I have always tried to act in support of my values, I try to reduce my meat intake more and more, I try to save energy, and stuff like that...but I'm also a gamer shut in, so, I guess I'm supporting your theory lol?
Yes, I know this category of people. The kind who stir up drama yet do not follow through on it at all and just quietly suck up their pride and continue business as usual.

But yes, it's likely I would have made this decision even without this Blitzchung shitshow. Just made it a whole lot easier I guess.
It's not a claim, it's called the news. Do you need a source that Trump is President too? But since you're too lazy, [here you go] (http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=bobby+kotick+epstein+little+black+book). Chillax.
Well this was a good talking thanks to share actualy usefull information, i think you are wrong in one particular step of this analisis, you assume that the rest of the world would cancel every blizzard game from their life, putting aside the people that can't because they made those games their life supporting revenue, there are tons of people who are going to ignore this thing and in the long run is gonna blow over.
That shows a lot of faith in politicians who already know the situation and haven‚Äôt acted
Shit good point, gotta add \*Please drink responsibly\*

Give me a min... I have to make a meme for this comment alone...

Edit: https://imgur.com/BMZN6La
Badum tss.
Just cheat or play with hacks, they eventually will delete your account ?
I cannot delete my account any other way than issuing a gov. photo ID currently. I have no other options on their website.
The thing is, this bit of revenue they lose in the west is nothing compared to the revenue they gain from China. If Actiblizzard has to choose one, they will choose China- And its clear they already have.
Wow. Pretty overt Chinese nationalism there, but a player protesting against the CCP's brutal regime is too political? Very hypocritical.
With that kind of attitude? I just don't believe you. You're weak willed and you have a defeatist attitude, people like you are why things don't change for the better.
Im not going to spend much time convincing anyone that standing up to a totalitarian regime that harvests organs and crushes all dissent is a moral duty. There isnt time to get everyone on board. If you dont see that standing up to repression and organ harvesting and genocide is the right thing to do, I cant do anything for you.
That is the *exact* point of all this: Hearthstone (the game in question here) is directed at Americans, and yet still caters to Chinese censors. It's an example of a broader trend for all media to avoid pissing off China, even if the Chinese aren't the biggest target market. 

This can happen only because people in the rest of the world don't care or aren't aware that it's happening. Companies lose nothing by catering to China because it doesn't hurt their reputation anywhere else, so why not do it? If people *did* care and notice, then the companies might think twice before censoring.

And normally a movement like this doesn't do much, but it comes on the heels of many other high-profile censorship cases (the NBA, South Park) and weeks away from Blizzcon. People are primed to listen and care, and there's a good reason for it to stay in the media for a long time.  These are historically the big things needed for a boycott or protest movement to succeed. Blitzchung probably knew this and was acting strategically.
It's still a mobile game they've released, and King has released numerous other mobile games alongside it.

Call of Duty Mobile just came out and is like the hottest mobile game right now so you just look a *wee* bit misinformed.
The future which will consist of bending over to ccp censors and helping them crush dissent while the west turns its back and even your even your own employees get fed up and start slinging their resumes, apparently.
lol k
They're the only Activision-Blizzard associated entity to give a statement. While Activision-Blizzard sits quietly and lets the whole thing blow over so they can return to business as usual. So until then, it's basically Acti-Blizz's stance. They stand with China and defend China's pride, so they can have a pretty penny out of China's market.
No, that's not what they sound like.

What they said is an objective take on what we can currently observe right now, based on all that we know. Not one word twxxx said has anything to do with what you suggest.

Now, if you want to talk about what people sound like, you on the other hand ...
Keep on keeping on, fellow shut in
No.   
burden of proof is always on the person who makes the claim.  
you cannot shift this to someone else.

"who is the president" is common knowledge.   

"did X person diddle children?" is not common knowledge, so you should provide a source.

especially if someone politely requests it.

you need to chillax and learn that something can be "news" and also not "common knowledge" and also be a reasonable request.

im not lazy, YOU"RE lazy, you made the claim, YOU PROVIDE THE PROOF.

thats how talking to other people works.

your original response was very short, in the same "5 seconds" it took for you to be a snarky dickbag, you could have provided proof, but no, you wanted to be rude and lazy.

thats on you.
> putting aside the people that can't because they made those games their life supporting revenue

They already made the money from making it and aren't making more from us playing it, that money goes to shareholders and CEO's...  Go suck Winnie the Xi's dick elsewhere.
Acting on Blizzard vs doing nothing with politicians because they havent done anything out of themself?

Maybe if you wrote that letter you'd get some actual answers and movement instead of waiting for Blizzards PR department to mess up again, like some kind of game. Doesnt show much support to those being hurt and harmed in Hong Kong that you delete your videogame, but it would show support if you stepped to your local politicians and made a point of it.

Country?
Im not sure about that though. Seems more like they were trying to dip their fingers in both pies and hoping they would not get forced to choose only one. Now that they have been put on the spot, itll be interesting to see what move they make.
You see, that's why we make the chinese government uncomfortable with working with Blizzard by associating all their works with the things they don't want their people to see.
The defense is "b-but thats not Blizzard its Netease, they control communications in china for Blizz"

Yeah, and they're making a hugely political statement on an official Blizzard channel, representing the companies values and politics.

HMMMMM, SOUND FAMILIAR?
Mfw when the real card game was politics all along
Nice try Cap'n Pedant, but what the OP meant was that they haven't released a mobile game directed at the Chinese market yet.

You know that's what he meant and you still insisted on this nonsense, pointless argument over a point he didn't make because you think that makes you "win" when all it does is make you look like a teenager.
Okay, none of you are following the logic here.  The link (if you clicked it, which I'm guessing you didn't) shows 2007 to 2018.  A bunch of you keep telling me "COD Mobile just came out".  Well, if it "just came out" then it's not in those numbers.  Is it?  And even if it was in those numbers, it's not directed at China.  Is it?  

I'm unfamiliar with King.  Please point me to the pre-2019 mobile games from King that are directed at China.
You know he's right though, China's market only continues to grow and it is much much larger than the western hemisphere combined. Blizzard can give 0 fucks about America's butthurt feelings when they are due to make billions in the coming years.
What we can currently observe right now is that Blizzard upheld their rules of no politics during tournaments. Doesn't matter if the politics are about democracy, revolution, nationalism, communism or whateverism. He would've been banned, DQd and lost all prize money no matter what political view he had. What we can also observe right now is that Netease wrote on THEIR weibo account and Blizzard hasn't said anything other than their announcement that he was DQd and banned. Netease isn't Blizzard.
lol no one is litigating here, you're soapboxing "burden of proof" over a one line comment that takes 5 sec to verify. Looking at your history it's clear you love inventing drama where there is none. Glad I gifted you the most self-satisfying moment of your angry day, lmao!
Ideally, people would do both. But with how society works currently targeting the corporate side rather than the political side will be more consistent, reliable and effective even if it‚Äôs less immediate. ‚ÄúTrust in the system‚Äù is how you end up with a clusterfuck like brexit, it doesn‚Äôt work.
United States.
I would not be shocked if Blizzard headquarters is literally airlifted from California to Beijing
The logic is here: you saying they've never released a mobile game and everybody else showing you that's provably untrue and has been for a long time.

King has made a number of games but their most prominent ones are all the games in the Candy Crush series. Which are also available in China, as they were localized and released by Tencent over 5 years ago.
No it's not, learn to do a google search: https://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/united-states/article/2180471/how-badly-chinas-economy-doing-look-behind
Or china just takes blizz intellectual property and employees and kick them back out of the country because a local industrialist bribed the ccp to facilitate it, like what happened to GM. Pure short term greed and selling out to communists isnt always a financially sound strategy
you made the claim, you provide the proof, nothing else matters.
Brexit came from independant newspapers lying to people, attacking companies over politics is nonsense if they arent political. And blizzard arent political.
Lmao

Are you being pedantic or just disingenuous?  Clearly, when I said mobile games, I was referring to mobile games directed at China, as that was the subject of conversation.  But I didn't literally say that, so you have me on a technicality.   You're the best.

Candy Crush.  I've said it before, I'll say it again.  Not. Directed. At. China.  In the context of this conversation, Candy Crush doesn't show Activision's attempt to grab a massive chunk of China's mobile game market.  You can't just translate Candy Crush and expect to grab 40% of a market.  This conversation is getting ridiculous.
lol GDP.  One of the worst indicators for how well a country is doing.  That stock market move he mentions isn't really an indication of failure to grow.   It was a bubble.  Much like our own bubble in 2007.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316\_Chinese\_stock\_market\_turbulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015%E2%80%9316_Chinese_stock_market_turbulence)
Doesn't matter how their economy is doing when they have potentially 20x the playerbase than America does. It's simple math dude, China is a much more lucrative market to game developers than the US.
Zzzzzzz you are the boringest flavor of insufferable. I hope you get well, really I do.
Thats what I'm saying, CHina takes over Blizzard and just moves their HQ to Beijing.
GDP, *and* every other major economic indicator: https://www.bbc.com/news/business-49791721

Can't tell if you're actually this dense or just a well-paid communazi troll.
it 100% matters if that playerbase can't afford to buy their games because their economy's tanking.
Deeper pockets in America.
Eh most companies don't have the foresight it would require to dig deep and plant roots in a tightly controlled market like China. China would rather use the US companies to dig those roots in their home countries. Companies can go bankrupt, China isn't going anywhere. The math might be simple, it's predicting how China acts that's the difficult part.
