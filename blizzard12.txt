They already chose a side. Don't allow them to just unban the man and gloss over it. Let blizzard fall.
Oh boy its all kicking off now.
This needs more recognition, keep this stuff coming guys/gals
*"It's about to go down."*
Get this to the front page guys!
I'd be willing to bet that they've lost more than that $10k prize money by now.

How far does this have to go before we see some actual blizzard values come back?  China makes up ~14% of their income atm, and even though it is projected to get a lot higher your money still means a lot to the company.
This is awesome. I was just about to hit 60 in Classic, and canceled my subscription.
Holy shit, that's huge.
Unsubbed to WoW and removed battle.net app from my pc.  #boycottBlizzard
It's gonna be kind of hard to top someone with "I made this game" in the reason for cancelling section.

If you are not already muted in wow classic chat you are doing it wrong..   


Spam it up . Free Hong Kong
Large companies like Blizzard are nothing without the support of the people behind it. If the internet can keep the momentum going on this issue, Blizzard is gonna have a really tough fiscal quarter.
Blizzard is an American Company and for them to side with China and their blocking of Free Speech is disgusting, they should be removed from the US and moved to China if they want to salad toss em' so much

Everything deleted as of tonight. Not wishing ill on Blizzard, their employees, or anybody playing their games - best wishes to you all - but as somebody born and brought up in the USSR, simply logging in makes me feel kind of dirty. I won't try to justify or explain, it just is. I know what they did and why. I can't in good conscience support it. 

Furthermore, my late TBC (thousands of hours played across multiple games over a decade+) account is in [queue for deletion](https://imgur.com/a/FF2JRlf). If Blizzard doesn't reverse the course on this before my account is gone, I'm well and truly done. If they think I'll come crawling back on a fresh account because Diablo V or VII or X looks like all the hotness and my friends are playing it, they're sorely mistaken. I could easily set the world record in grudge holding Olympics and I have a long memory. 

Have fun and thanks for all the fish!
Lvl 60 rogue in classic and I just unsubbed too. I say this because getting to 60 took many, mannnny  hours.

Classic was great, but I‚Äôm not going to let this slide. 

If anything classic is emblematic of everything that current blizzard no longer is.
Developers like Mark Kern leaving Blizzard is what caused its downfall. Who could have known selling your soul to China could have a negative impact on the company?
I have uttermost respect for people standing up to China when it could have serious consequences for them.
Follow him for anime belly buttons. Like...a lot of them....its kinda his thing. He was also an adamant Epic games store defender, UNTIL Tencent took a stance on the human rights issue, he is now boycotting them too. Hes a bit...rough around the edges but hes a good guy.
Wow, that\`s a strong statement. I hope the founding members see this.
I cancelled my subscription and I'm going to get a refund for WC3 Reforged.
I loved the games but jesus christ ultimate oof blizzard
Who gives a fuck what he thinks. He treated his employees like utter trash and made a failed MMO
Please note https://twitter.com/blasternation/status/1181993793081532418?s=21
Mark Kern is based as hell.
Mark Kern, man of the people.
Everyone BLIZZARD APOLOGIZED!!! to China
This guy is based, I've followed him for a while. He sticks to his principles and doesn't sugarcoat things. A breath of fresh air tbh.
Good on him for this gesture, I guess, but people should be aware of this guy's strong anti-feminism, white-genocide-conspiracy-propagation, and general history of promoting alt-right views.

I know a lot of you probably *already know this and agree with him*; this is a psa for everyone else.
What a supreme champ
oh wow anyway its been long over due with how bad the OW scene became cancelled all my subs might even throw my account away
Wow. Bravo üëèüèº
I just submitted my request to have all my personal data removed from my blizzard account, effectively deleting my previous purchase history. Solidarity!
Thanks for being such a boss, Mark!
Keep posting Mei. The fire has only began
All important things aside, did the Team Lead on World of Warcraft have to pay a subscription fee to play World of Warcraft?
Thanks, bud. Here's hoping.

Not sure if this has been posted, but a more detailed excerpt of why and what happened to him in the past
I wonder why I should do with all my hearthstone cards. I have archived top100 legendary and I‚Äôve paid several hundred‚Äôs to stay competitive although I quit two months ago. LUL
So did J Allan Brack successfully win the awards for world‚Äôs biggest douchebag and simultaneously tanking a major company in the shortest amount of time? Cause if he didn‚Äôt, he should.
Canceling his subscription..? Blizzard employees literally have lifetime passes, so I'm not even sure if this does anything.
[deleted]
\#BoycottBlizzard for their #SuckDongForYuan.  Good on Kern.
I feel like I'm playing the clean uncorrupted version from 10 years ago, despite where the money goes. (Which I just blew my gold on instead anyway)
This is blowing way up since the last time I said it
Imagine fighting to bring vanilla servers only to have them shit the bed less than two months after launch. Incredible.
This doesn't make up for selling out FireFall to the Chinese.
I can't say that I play Blizzard games that often, and I've only spent $20 on Diablo 2, but I feel canceling an account is the only thing that will make Blizzard understand people still care about values instead of pure entertainment. Also I created a Reddit account purely to post this.
Paging one Jeff "Jeff From the Overwatch Team" Kaplan.  You see this?  Be nice if you followed suit...
Hell ya
Although i had not subscribed World of Warcraft, i bought Diabio 3 and spent a lot of time for this game.

But today for our democracy and freedom of speech, i deleted Diabio 3 and [battle.net](https://battle.net) on my computer. 

I cannot find the way to delete my account on [battle.net](https://battle.net). Maybe they will delete my account after i changed my battletag.

And yet, Mark Kern is still a massive douche.
Cancelled my sub as well.
What would be great, is people canceling their blizzcon tickets, nobody showing up.
I read this with Arthas's voice.
Holy. Shit. Now this is courage.
I was having such a good time in vanilla wow too. But this cannot stand. I wouldnt be surprised if private servers start springing up again.
I'm surprised he didn't do this when he got kicked off the team.
Mark Kern is OG.  Respect.
If you want to delete your account (for any reason) and now you can't, an alternative is to get banned.
Who is Mark Kern?
But did he? Did he really...
I already deleted as soon as i heard of this horseshit. Shame on you blizzard.
Lost in a lot of the discussion on this thread is that I didn't cancel my WoW subscription to punish Blizzard or to try to affect change (though that would be nice). I did it simply because I don't want to give my money to them.

I doubt our cancellations will have much effect. That wasn't my motivation.
As if I ever would quit classic wow over some bs politics psyop that has no impact whatsoever on me.
Way to take a stand. Also consider deleting your account wholesale. It doesn't directly hurt them, but it sends a clear message about valuing human rights and basic human freedoms over their products. That's easy for me to say though, I haven't invested the years that many of you have in WoW, that's a lot of investment and history to flush down the drain.
Sic Semper Tyrannis! We got more people to fight against communism!
So does/did he still work for Blizzard as the Classic team lead?  What does this mean, ultimately?  Initially I thought he was just a previous team leader who is now unsubscribing, but this post says he was the team lead for Classic.  Is he not any longer?
Big pp move
Mark has always been a stand up guy.  Really says a lot tbh.
You all think your small little sub cancellations will affect anything at all? Don't get me wrong, good on you for standing up for others and what you believe in. But while you delete out all the money you already cashed into blizz to buy the games and services. Actiblizz will be rolling in the billions of Chinese dollars they will not have lost. Your subs will change nothing other to then force people to repurchase in the future if something changes. I am no longer a fan of Actiblzz, have not been for years. Think when you do things. Just imo.

Btw: good job Actiblizz......
So you guys are engaging in this discussion by using sweatshop/slave labor built technology, right? If you don't refuse to buy a new phone or video game console or whatever you aren't really helping or standing up to anything.
Get your phones ready!!
Wow.. Awesome that someone of his stature finally stood up. Big props, Mark.
myself and my girlfriend have done the same thing.
Let Blizzard fail.

I came back with rapturous excitement when Classic launched and only 6 weeks in, I've unsubbed, handing Blizzard a similar message but that's not far enough. The fact of the matter is, Blizzard didn't blunder, it wasn't a miscalculation. It was a deliberate corporate decision from the very top in an attempt to keep the Chinese government happy in direct contrast to their human rights violations. There has been no uncertainty that China's actions are OK with the rest of the world, yet they still actively chose to support China and attempted to silence any voice of dissent.

They chose China over us.

So, let them fail. I've not only cancelled my WoW subscription, but I've ordered my entire account deleted. My remaining game time (4 months), my Overwatch, D3, D2 and LoD and Starcraft are now gone.

I'm not happy about that, but I can't in good conscience continue to support their corporate policy by playing their games ever again.
Refreshing to see an important voice such as Mark Kern weighing in on such an important issue!
Holy...
Now this is a yikes moment
Oh wow this huge!
Holy shit.
Lets all pretend mark kern isn't a terrible person.
I like tuudles.
Hahahahahah xd people rly think that destroying their own stuff and cancelling wow subs help ? In what world are you guys living?
If they ever "stand up" it will only be an act to make it look like they're sorry. I can see Blizzard talking to the Chinese government and coming with a plan to tone down the protest
As for me, absolutely support for Blizzard. It seems to support law. And not different idiots, it's good news
I don't know how people actually think, Blizzard will fall because of this. Yes, a few people will cancel their relationship to blizzard and brag about it, also people like Mark here, who I rly Like and I support all of it. But the huge majority will just continue to use blizzard as company. They support their own bad reputation, although the money won't stop to flow because of this.
 

If you were the CEO of a multi billion $$ company, what would you do?

Note that I do in fact support Hong Kong, but I stand by Blizzard.

China accounts about 90% of all eSports profits.

Players specifically sign a contract with stipulations to stay out of politics while on a blizzard platform.

1 comment can cost a company billions. Nothing to do with right and wrong.

It‚Äôs not his reputation he put on the line, it‚Äôs blizzards.

The ban was necessary to save blizzard from a all out ban of their platform throughout china. This would have netted billions in profit loss.

Most blizzard employees are young kids which lack wisdom and big picture in life. If they didn‚Äôt ban him, they might not have a job tomorrow. China would blackball blizz and then blizz would go bankrupt.

As soon as he opened his mouth.. blizzard was DOOMED one way or the other. I genuinely feel for blizzard and its employees right now.
Lol this just makes all you flops look worse. This is the guy who‚Äôs failed p2w shooter died and he was depressed.
Lol enjoy your new job.
The only people that will see messages like that are support personnel and I can guarantee it will never leave that office.
Blizz done goofed.
Big dick
What did he cancel since as an employee he gets the game for free....
Yep. I wish it doesn't go back to normal with an apology. Some people actually said "Until blizz apologizes I'm not going online". Can't blame them though. Personally I love wow and it's story and it's a shame what blizz did for biz.

Want them to pay haaaard.

Edit : Thank you very much for the plat my  Anonymous bro.
They double downed on their stance by silencing collegiate level Hearthstone players. They held up a sign that said "Free Hong Kong, Boycott Blizzard"; quickly cut away. No more interviews and the like from college level players. 

They're firmly in the pro China camp for as long as it makes financial sense to be.
Nah, thats a bad stance. There needs to be some path to redemption for companies that fuck up or no one will ever bother trying to redeem themselves.

A full apology, return the prize money, unban the player and rehire those two casters with more pay (if theyre willing to come back). Plus a plan for not repeating this mistake and actual follow through. That would be a reasonable minimum standard for regaining the public tryst.
Short if Blizzard directly staying they wear completely wrong and actually supporting the Hong Kong protests no apology will be sincere.  

Anything else is just an attemt to save face.  They have already shown they are currently willing to do anything China asks of them.
Would you rather destroy and entity than winning it on your side? This attitude is only inciting war. I would try a more peaceful approach to obtain justice, before going to war.
I'm fine if there is some reversal.  I think Kibler had had the most level headed take thus far
Hopefully they just ignore it and do not acknowledge it. It's probably the best move since the psyop media outrage disappears regardless in a week.
The side they chose was "don't hijack official streams for personal political protests".

Punishment was too harsh though.
Hijacking this to spread this as far as possible.

Until they get themselves banned by China for standing up to them, aint no forgiveness for these traitors! Did you see the Chinese version of the statement they released over this whole mess? They called China their "MOTHERLAND" and that they will always protect her honor..... WTF, TRAITORS!
I agree what they did was unforgiveable, but at the same time a lot of innocent people could lose their jobs
How much of their income comes from the United States?
Mark has always been great, it's just that up until now you weren't aware what was really going on.
True dat.
I've read the article. Wow
How? I don't know much about him at all.
[deleted]
I agree he's a piece of shit. But left and right are united on this. As long as we don't use this as an opportunity to push our own differing political agendas but just stand up for what we agree on, then it's all good.
Yeah he hasn't been involved with blizzard in 15 years. He has nothing to lose by doing this and he does it often. He thrusts himself into the spotlight whenever he can, using his former title to get attention and morally grandstand at every possible opportunity.

I dont disagree with his sentiment but it is tiresome when you see how often he does this. Literally every time blizzard is in the news this guy who is essentially a nobody comes out and makes a big PR stunt like he matters at all.
Disagree, he's a great guy with great tweets
Pretty sure The9 (chinese company that used to oversee WoW's operation  in China before netease took over) became majority owner of Red 5 studios ( Mark Kern's ) in 2010. He was outed only at the end of 2013. So yeah Kern already sold to China well before this incident. As much as I hate all this crap going on this is just a vapid AF move from a shitty person who already sold out to China once and now condemning Blizzard since hes no longer on the hook to care.
I canceled mine, and used his quote as my reason.
I was hoping this sub would become what that sub aspires to be
Well done, respect!
Props man! There are many with you!
I promise you that Mark Kern was not a loss for Blizzard.
Same with WC3. It kills me though. Maybe I‚Äôll pirate it if they don‚Äôt reverse their stance.
This is exactly what I first thought.. Firefall anyone??
Lol being wrong and having a shit opinion about one thing doesnt mean he cant be right in other areas? What's with this obsession of finding old tweets regarding irrelevant topics and using it as a way to ruin someones entire character.

Pathetic.
This is like a third or fourth hand accusation.
i don t see anything wrong.
Mark Kern didn't state anything wrong in that tweet. His opinion was not "alt-right"
Is there anything else or is that it? Is that the worst tweet they could find or what?
Where's the lie?
Kern periodically nukes his Twitter account so stuff doesn't come back to bite him.

Doesn't always work though.
Wow, had to dig long and hard for that, huh? A tweet from over 4 years ago. . .
Hot take : certain websites deserved the gate and improved markedly as a result

The top 3 gaming news sites used to be full of stupid shit like the verge PC building video and undisclosed affiliate links
Seriously, this. Kern is a moron.
Thanks now I like him even more
Hmm yeah, this ain't great. A broken clock is right twice a day, I guess.
As a member of the Alt-Right, since it's such a nebulous term at times, I fully support Mark Kern. Anything to the right of PRoC is alt-right.
No they didn't. Blizzard has been silence. I believe you are referring to some chinese hearthstone Twitter account that apologized to China.
He's a shitty excuse of a human being that treated his employees like they were simply trash under his shoe. You think Amazon workers are treated like trash? Well, take that and multiply it by 100.
Yep, he's pretty slimy himself, though I'm generally taking that as a sign of just how big a mess Blizzard has stepped into. This is a politically broad-spectrum fuckup.
He's a complete and utter weasel, it's true; but hard times make for strange bedfellows.

I think it just goes to show that almost everyone who isn't a member of the effing party wants Blizzard to burn right now.
The fact that even people like him are standing up agains't Blizzard, really shows how colossal their fuck up was
"The issue that has brought us all together is besides the point: what really matters here is that I don't like his political views".
So anybody who disagrees with the left is now alt right? He is not any of the things or has done any of the things you listed. If you truly believe so post evidence instead of just asking people to take your word as fact.
Yeah this guy has opinions I disagree with fuck Hong Kong.
This is the first time you have antifa leftists and alt-right klan members agreeing on something. Let's just enjoy this moment for a minute.
The fire rises
He worked on the original game back in 2005 and has since left the company. Before classic was announced, he voiced his support and met with the Blizzard executives, along with the guys that were running the Nostalrius private server. As long as you are an employee, you don't.have to pay a wow sub, but since he has been long gone, he is subject to a subscription like any of us.
You should dust them on stream while explaining why.
lol no they dont. I know, because I use them.. They are one year game cards , They expire.
I‚Äôm not sure one will want to forsake his job that he clearly loves doing for the sake of a boycott. Keep in mind Jeff still works at Blizzard, Mark Kern doesn‚Äôt.
He wored on classic classic. as in he worked at Blizz 15 years ago
What's your comment doing to help?
'helping' doesn't mean what you seem to think it means.

You literally just typed the same argument the meme of the kid saying "and yet you live in a society" lmao
In a world where 1 million cancelled subs equals 15 million US$ they are not getting this month.
In a world where PR image matters. In a world where marketing and profits need to strike this delicate balance between money and morals.

Blizzard decided that they will bend their asshole to the Chinese market and went full scorched Earth tactics. Good for them tho.
Sucking ccp dick too much here, bub
They have managed to get government attention over this and the #1 most upvoted post in Reddit history is over this. It is hardly a few people boycotting them.
>Mark Kern

He left Blizzard in 2006 co-founding Red 5
He has his own studio. He made enough money from WoW to live comfortably for years
Idk, I'm not support personel and I can see it.
I'm looking at it right now.
This absolutely isn't true. Data on unsubscriptions is aggregated and reported on, with summaries going far up the managerial hierarchy.

Some product manager/data analyst is going to submit a weekly report on unsubscription numbers that shows a huge spike, and they'll have to provide some qualitative explanation for why it happened. That is exactly why this box on the unbsub screen exists, and what people write in here will filter up to executives.
So you and me are on the support team?

Damn, i must be owed some paychecks!
It‚Äôs a screenshot from twitter...
Do you really think they don't care about losing subscribers left and right? Accounts being deleted? And the negative publicity all of it is causing? 

Sure it may change nothing, but it also may change everything. To say they don't care about it as all is far from true.
Big Dick Energy
Probably his job. I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd be too happy about it.
He‚Äôs not an employee he quit decades ago and engaged in several failed ventures. Now he just trolls blizz constantly with stupid stunts like this.

I like him but let‚Äôs be honest he‚Äôs a big troll.
I will accept an apology in the form of a complete and total reversal on their ruling toward Blitzchung, IN ADDITION to a FREE Hong Kong Protest Mei skin for all Overwatch players. If they do that, I accept their apology, since THAT will get them banned in China and show where their allegiances really lie. They won't though, lets be perfectly honest.
I said something like that to my friends. I just want Blizzard to fix this so I won't have to never play WoW again.
Hate to be the bearer of bad news , but Blizzard isn't gonna fall. After this move, they are completely secure in China. For every one employee that walks out on them, ten will be there ready to take a job at Blizzard, and be morally flexible too. Blizz may lose a few hundred or even several thousand subscribers here in the West, but they already showed China is more important to them anyways.
Blizzard is dead to me , even if they come out and apologize now it doesn't take away their initial course of action.
Corporations are like animals, we need to train them and reward them for doing the right thing. Rewarding them for going back on this after punishing them for doing it in the first place would send a very clear message to other corporations considering bowing to the demands of China.

Being on the side of freedom and democracy needs to be profitable or they won't do it.
WoW has been really going downhill for a while, in terms of community/playerbase if not gameplay. If this is what dethrones it as a top MMO, then let it be so.
It was suppose to give Bliztchung a sense of pride and accomplishment!
Bro a flip to deciding that it‚Äôs more profitable to support HK than China would be a paradigm shift in world power balance, especially HK.
Who will pay? You want to punish all people in China who play and enjoy Blizzard games?
Our only option is to make it financially NOT worth it.

Also, I would love to see FARA investigation.
That's the crux of the issue that I've had to explain to some people who really just want to be right so they don't have to think about quitting playing: no, you can't just not buy everything that comes from China. But you specifically don't have to buy from a company that actively censors free speech in order to please China. Blocking Hong Kong messages/imagery and deleting discussion about it is tantamount to propagandizing China. They are making sure that people don't find out about what is happening in Hong Kong, and the less the world knows about it, the more likely those people are going to fail. These actions could potentially cost lives.
IMO the path to redemption would be as some said, a pro-HK Mei skin, or some other clear unambiguous statement. The point is, it's no longer enough to be 'neutral' as a company, do something that will risk or guarantee the CCP will ban them, that risks their oh so precious Chinese income. THAT will prove they're done putting cash above human rights. When they take action that could actually cost them something.
> There needs to be some path to redemption for companies that fuck up or no one will ever bother trying to redeem themselves.

This doesn't bother me. I'd be more than happy to see Blizzard stop doing business in the US entirely after this debacle. If they'd released anything worth playing in the last 20 years it'd be different. But they're basically a chinese mobile game developer at this point that makes token updates to their twilighted MMO and shooter.
They declared a war the on humanity when they stifled human rights. Punish and push out those who made the decision but there won't be a bringing them to our side.
I actually agree with this. Thisll probably be what happens
I think you're lost
Unfortunate but unavoidable
More than 50% in the Americas, 33% everywhere else and 14% in China.
I just saw something on youtube so take it with a grain of salt , could of been BelluarGaming 

anyways he said over the next few years that the  Chinese PC gamers will grow to equal more in number than the entire population of the USA...

so i think that explains blizzards shitty actions
Mostly US, BUT the vast majority of their investors are Chinese. So most of their money is coming from China which is why they're willing to take this dive. They'd rather appease their investors than maintain their integrity
Nah, he can take all his stupid gamergate and SJW hot takes, shove it all on the firefall bus, and drive away forever for all I care.

Also, take a look at this: https://old.reddit.com/r/firefall/comments/4l1agq/what_buying_back_the_firefall_ip_really_means_by/
pretty good article [here](https://www.techinasia.com/firefall-mark-kern-sacked-the9-story) about him
I'm just tired to see him jump on every occasion to heal his frustration.
Having a common enemy may help heal the divides in modern day politics
True but Kern is pushing his own agenda in this rather than being about the HK protesters, which is telling.
I'd like if this was a chance for blizz subscribers to start paying attention to human rights abuses on american soil as well.

But I doubt it
Nah he's a disgusting opportunist, i can't say i "agree" with him on anything
This came up in a highlight thing and I just remember seeing several tweets from him after trying to promote his new game to people commenting.

&#x200B;

Like, good on you Mark for doing the right thing but let's not pretend there wasn't an underlying motive.
He's a clinical narcissist who abuses employees under him and comes out of the woodwork to make every Blizzard backlash about himself. He's a piece of shit.
Firefall was the best worst game I ever played. Like someone made a decent game and then let a nine year old loose in the editor for six months.
Cancel culture in a nutshell
Cancel culture.
Liberals think everything right of crazy is alt-right.
I'd also like better examples than someone calling out the SJW movement, as there exist several concepts as to what the SJW movement is exactly, and some of those concepts are absolutely not worth defending.

If that is alt-right to people, then I don't know what I am, because I'm certainly not alt-right, but the SJW movement has brought such toxicity to the world that I can't support that either.

Yeah, he's in one political camp, and he referred ina snide manner to people in the other camp. 

Ghastly, isn't it?
Well, he used the phrase "right to have sex". Ya know, that thing that is *supposed* to be a mutual decision between consenting adults, and that no one is *supposed* to be owed.

That's gonna be a hard YIKES from me, dawg. Tells me a lot about a person, that one thing.

You should have differing positions depending the topic. Not some stance where you just align with a section and agree with all of it.
Can you provide a link in a pm or comment, I'm not aware of this. I only know him through what I've seen of him and some other devs posts talking with or about him on Twitter.
The people like him were always going to stand up against this. It's the people like the one you're responding to that are acting out of character in doing the right thing.
Literally no one is saying that.
Yeah we aint really agreeing if this dude supports someone that would do the same kind of shit in America
I know **I‚Äôd** want to know who this guy is, so I tried to let like-minded people know. That‚Äôs all that‚Äôs happening here.

I think Blizzard is being reprehensible and I certainly hope as many people as possible agree, Mark included.
To bw honest his role and importance is abit overblown and it feels like he's just pushing to get his name out there and be relevant again
So Chris Metzen pays a sub too... According to you. 

&#x200B;

That's so cute that you believe that.
You should link the full one
Big if true.
> they'll have to provide some qualitative explanation for why it happened. 

Oh...I think they'll know, lol.
They (along with many other traitorous company's) only care about money and China with their 600+ million gamers to Americas 160 million or so cant compete. they really don't give a shit what Americans think. The main problem with capitalism is GREED.
Oh so something that Blizzard doesn't have?
More like Limp Dick Energy, am I rite? I'll just go away now.
Don't forget compensation for the Taiwanese casters who were publicly fired for doing their jobs.
Their allegiances don't automatically switch after that. They HAD to come back here. They still chose China first. 

They Need To Pay.

That skin would be amazingly shameful to them haha. Great idea
> a FREE Hong Kong Protest Mei skin for all Overwatch players

Okay now we're over-reaching...  Blizzard does not need to take the side of Hong Kong, but they should not be taking the side of China.  A company shouldn't be expected to 'take sides' and should be neutral in politics like this.

This is an issue of the people vs government.  Companies shouldn't be involved in this issue in the same way that companies *shouldn't* (they are, but they shouldn't) be involved in politics.
About the worst way you can handle this as it just gives Blizzard the impression that any outrage can be swept under the rug with the right incentives.
Lol this will fizzle out when they announce Diablo 4 (especially if it has a D2 vibe). They don't need to apologize at all.

Nothing they do now will change things for me. I am not looking for some empty apology that they are forced to make to try to win people back.

I am more interested in seeing Blizzard punished to the full extend and not recover, so other companies will think twice before bending the knee. This is much bigger than just Blizzard.
That skin would be so popular. I don‚Äôt play overwatch and I would buy that if the money was partially donated to helping HK protesters.
So to people of china "until you are willing to die in fire squads no games for you"?
I will accept nothing but a split from Activision and suits getting fired with little to no severance pay
>a FREE Hong Kong Protest Mei skin for all Overwatch players

Don't encourage them to do this, they'll event-lock it for nine wins.
my thoughts as well. i‚Äôm pretty upset over the loss of wow in my life (dumb maybe but oh well) so i really hope blizzard takes the correct steps in fixing this - i even said as much in my cancel sub box.
Was exactly my thought too. They threw away 800 employees for a short term gain to keep shareholders impressed.

A few low level staff leaving means nothing to them. There'll be plenty more passionate naive people to replace them. 

Not to mention, losing a small amount of customers in the west in the short term, since give it a week or a month and it'll be forgotten. Compared to losing their $1 billion revenue from Chinese market instantly if China was to ban all their games.

Only Bobby Kotick's Activision-Blizzard and the quest for ALL the money, and then the money that doesn't exist beyond that.

Such is the AAA industry.
All of the Asian markets (SK, Japan, China, Australia) are 12% of their revenue. They absolutely need the Americas/EMEA markets.
So Blizzard can be that Chinese company making Chinese mobile games censoring the shit out of everything they do at the whim of the CCP, and any developer with self respect or a good reputation will work elsewhere, and they will lose relevance to anybody who wants to play on a screen bigger than a postage stamp. 

That's an agreeable conclusion. It doesn't have to end with Blizzard ceasing to exist. I mean, even Atari still exists in some form.
We have a trade war with China that isn't likely to end any time soon. This will be in the news cycle forever.
I mean, you've obviously been very active and have been a dedicated whale to their games for quite a while. You've been inactive for over a month, and now came back to post this. 

Prior to that, I can't find a single post in any Blizzard subreddit in the past 7 months.
It's a shame because the game is literally just about to properly start going uphill again, at least in my eyes. And I am very curious about the next expansion, which I was/am going to use to judge if the WoW team has learned from BfA.
Yeah retail WoW is pretty bad, but Classic only came out a month ago and probably got a few million subs off of it, which definitely boosted their numbers up a alot.
Let us be honest; WoW really hasn't been a "Top MMO" by anything other than sheer, raw hangers-on for a while now. Hell, I bet if we discounted all the Chinese, Russian and Korean multi-boxers + bots they wouldn't even have the raw numbers anymore. 

Since Warlords WoW has a been a shambling abomination kept moving and relevant only be sheer inertia alone - its been an inferior product and service for a long time now. Inferior to FFXIV, Guild Wars 2, even ESO.

Sunk Cost Fallacy has been Blizzard's biggest ally for a long time now.
Yep. Looks like wow killer will not be classic either. It's Blizzard themselves.
That will be an unpleasant by-product despite what happens and what I say. That was perhaps some harsh wording on my part. Apologies. But Blizz is going to come crawling back to the non Chinese audience. The Chinese are only 12% of their audience for all their games combined. They would rather get the 88% isn't it. 

Diablo: Immoral is clearly what drove them to do what they did. The Chinese have the largest mobile game audience because most of those that have jobs use public transport for 1-5 hours a day and majority of them use this time to play their mobile games. The number of those is estimated to be 300 million. Imagine what income flux it would be if just 10 million of them bought the game.
Why do I care what a bunch of pro-fascist Chinese gamers want? They support a dictator. They're lucky it's not the pre-nuclear age or we'd have marines flying the US flag over Beijing by now.
I think most of us could not possibly care less. We're far more interested in the sovereignty of our own nations, nations where freedom of speech and freedom of expression are sacred and expected, than what videogames some brainwashed drones in China are playing.
Well you can‚Äôt since China is Blizzards biggest source of income.
Some clear unambiguous statement reconfirming commitment to western values and human rights would be nice, yes. Please not an overwatch skin though... that seems like too rapid a turnaround to he sincere and kind of cash-grabby. Like ‚Äúhey guys heard you were outraged, did you hear about our game overwatch? Go buy it and get our free apology skin!‚Äù

Let them donate to the protesters or smth instead lol.
Its not so much about blizz than the 100 other media and game companies in the exact same boat trying to decide whether to try and get back in the us and wests good graces. Bringing them back into the fold strengthens our hand in the long run.
Their only thing I've played since 2014 is wow vanilla, and I see no reason why I wouldn't play once again on a private server. I already payed for their game back in 2005
Nope
Apparently the 14% includes more countries than just China
Would you please provide a source for this?

All I have been able to find is Tencent‚Äôs 5% investment and misinformation about China being the largest source of revenue for Blizzard currently.
It will take you a while to realize he was always right about everything, but it's ok.
So this is the company he got fired from because he refused to sell out to China, huh...
Wow. I mean when he comes up in my suggestions on Twitter he usually seems to be acting the part of the jerk/seemed somewhat full of himself but I didn't think it was this bad.
Did you just really use SRD as an argument in your favor?
That and his behaviour overall
I've had passing fantasies about an alien invasion uniting us, but it turns out all we really needed was China
how? and what's his agenda?
Right? Cops are murdering people here in the US in cold blood, some people are having to pay tens of thousands of dollars just to stay alive, and wages arent keeping up with inflation. I know it's worse in other places, but we still have so much that we need to work on here in the US
Yep, I did like the 100 or 150 kickstarter cause I loved what I was seeing... then epic failure ensued.
Yep, all Liberals think the same way.  

/s
That's a big part of the problem.  Some people hear "social justice" and think it's a catch all term for everything good in the world. Other people hear the term "social justice" and think it references the folks who scream at white people for having dreadlocks and who want to ban the word 'bossy'.   I'm familiar enough with Mark Kern's political rambling to know he's talking about the latter in quotes like that, but some people won't realize it.
Alt-right used to have a clear concise meaning. Now that meaning has been kind of muted by the overuse of it. Any time someone has an opinion on something that isn't fully progressive or is outside whatever arbitrary line that was drawn in the sand people sling it like crazy. Its getting to the point where its just a thing you say to someone who disagrees with you online.

Its disappointing because it allows actual scumbags to hide in that circus.
SJW was originally coined by people on the **left** to describe those who exploited social justice for self-serving reasons: social justice posers, bullies and crazy fanatics. 


However, it unfortunately became coopted by the right (starting with GamerGate), to the point that leftists rarely use the term, even if they're critical of the kind of behavior it describes.
I don't know, you could say the same thing about love. "Everyone has the right to be loved." I think that's a good notion to have. Replacing that with sex doesn't make it rapey, it just places it in a more lewd context.

Rights are pretty much made up anyways. When you get down to it, they don't actually exist. You can claim a right to anything, but it'll never be objectively true. No one is really guaranteed anything but death. Hopefully that's not too dark to end this comment on, but you get my point.
Should he have to?
I got that reference!
Yes and that's honestly a huge part of why it was such a shitstorm. That used to be part for the course. That and constant high marks for bad games from certain uber publishers like EA.

Also affiliate links are legal and ethical. The problem was sites like Kotaku and Polygon hiding them with no disclaimer.

Nobody really gives shitty games like dragon age 2 goty or goty class scores anymore. Not a problem with one outlet because opinions differ but when every major reviewer gives a shitty EA game a 90+ while everyone else completely hates it it's obvious what's happening.
Seriously, grow up, you're pathetic and embarrassing.
^ A little boy thinks he knows enough about politics to condemn total strangers on the basis of it.
The "right to have sex" thing might not be the best take, but if at this point you can't notice something has gone very wrong with the far left's attitude towards whites then you either started using the internet yesterday or you must be a bit of a leftist radical yourself. I don't care at all what you think of me.
Depends on how it's broken.  It still could be.
It eventually will be
You heard the "Its Small Brain Time" alarm and boy did you ever answer it.

Just look up the Firefall debacle.

Million dollar bus, by a well known company, that has a TV show, and still shows that shit in their intro.
Does it really matter? I read his story and its on point.  It could be anyone from the inside who understands the dirty business practices. It was actualkly crazy to see because I just posted almost the exact same thing in another Blizz group I am in. The part that especially hurts was the part about how he never thought Blizzard of all companies would do this. I said that exact same thing. Thats why I invested in them. I believed in the company and its core values. Its core values have proven to be shit. And now I am going to pay for it.
uhh, no. Saying this dude didn't get a life long subscription doesn't mean no one ever possibly could have. He didn't say shit about metzen.
They do. It's just in their mouths instead.
they have small dick energy
An excellent point that slipped past my mind, complete and total reversal on the ruling towards the casters as well.
They weren't doing their jobs since they gave a platform to someone making political statements that would directly hurt Blizzard their revenue.
The point of a boycott isn't to punish for the sake of punishment, it's to get them to change their ways. If some of us don't go back after they meet our demands, we're encouraging them to just double down on the original move.

That said, I do think that our "demands" should be more than just a reversal of this decision. They need to make a serious gesture in which they demonstrate they will never censor players or employees to appease China again.
>Their allegiances don't automatically switch after that. They HAD to come back here. They still chose China first.

the best way to do that IMO is force them to choose between the Chinese Market and the rest of us 

If they reverse the decsion and release a statement that says they will never do this again, China will do to them what they are doing to the NBA

a fitting punishment , they dont get to take our money and enjoy our liberal values at the same time as they suck chinese dick

forcing them to choose one or the other is tshe outcome we want

We make it so choosing us gets them banned in China , rock and a hard place
They would pay. You think China would just ignore that?
I know its not the case because im sure there have been political things said before... but what if its not that they chose china but prefer to not be an outlet for political opines of any kind? Ie im not a Trump fan but if a player yelled impeach trump i n the same way i wouldnt appriciate that either.. i wonder if they would do the same in regards to punishment? I guess they would have it more clearly in their TOS. The longer they say nothing the worse it really gets
No, this isn't overreaching, the problem is they DID take a side, the side of China, now the only way to fix it is to reverse course. If they never got involved in the first place I would 100% agree with you, but we don't live in that world. Just like if you don't murder someone you don't get in trouble for murder and have to pay the price, if you don't submit to authoritarian regimes that violate human rights then you don't have to prove you're not on their side. They failed to do so, now they must prove they aren't on the side of authoritarian regimes.
You mean an incentive that gets them banned in China? Yeah, that's good enough to sweep it under the rug pal. If you don't give them something to do to be forgiven then they won't bother trying to change.
I don't think you understand.   A Hong Kong protest Mei skin would end them in China.
> I am more interested in seeing Blizzard punished to the full extend and not recover, so other companies will think twice before bending the knee. This is much bigger than just Blizzard.

I will post my reply from another comment:

This is how regimes like China rule. It's totalitarian. You are not allowed to make a mistake. You are not allowed to deviate from the norm and later come to realize you were wrong. The moment you deviate, you're dead.

Nobody cares about a change of heart because you won't be around for long enough to have it. This rule of fear is a prime driving force behind social oppression.

With the attitude that no matter what a company does after a screw up, it has to die and rip the thousands of employees down with it for a decision that they don't even support, then you are showing signs of being very susceptible to the extremist mentality that can make or break totalitarian governments.

There *can* be a totalitarian government about democracy that would be oppressing people with fear in a different way.
Pretty much, yeah. If you're going to support an authoritarian regime that is suppressing speech globally and violating the human rights of its citizens in actual concentration camps, we as a freedom loving democratic society shouldn't be catering to your wants. Stop being a shill for China.
It seems you are confused.

Activision and Blizzard are different entities and has no influence over eachother. What you probably meant was Activision Blizzard, which is their parent company.
That's only true if their more senior and high end talent doesn't up and leave. If project leads and senior devs start leaving. That's going to have a crippling impact on the company.
You're right, but China has the power to block Activision from their marketplace.

You can't say that for the western markets, here it is a user by user decision.

So how many are really going to boycott, and for how long will they do it?

They know our attention span is short and this will all be forgotten soon enough, but not soon enough to save the embarrassment for Blizzcon.

ETA:

Yes I'm sure many will permanently boycott Blizzard for this, but something tells me the $$$ lost on the western market will not be more than Activision losing access to the Chinese market.  And that right there will explain everything Activision does with respect to this.

I would be shocked if Activision does the "right" thing here, but I'm willing to be pleasantly surprised.
Well I believe that I don't have to be a big whale or an active reddit poster for my voice to matter. I'll vote with my dollars and every dollar counts.
BFA has been good for the last couple patches. It started out trash, but now it's like really good, *too good.* It was hard to unsub/uninstall.

Next expansion is going to be fire if it carries over, but if they want to play stupid games, I am not even going to watch Blizzcon, let alone pick up the exp or play overwatch or overwatch 2.
And WC3 getting a burst of players with reforged too... really hope Blizzard executives remedy this situation cuz I‚Äôd love to play their games again, sigh
I've heard Legion was great, not sure about BFA. But I logged on during a free week or something and Orgrimmar was nearly dead, even with the whole battlegroup thing. Just isn't the same anymore.
Yeah, but Classic came out a month ago and garnered probably a few million more subs which puts it far above any other MMO at the moment.
Y'know what?

That's a really good point.
Some might say that the **REAL** WoW killer was inside them all along
Trust nobody, not even yourself
I'm pretty sure that's been the general sentiment for many years now.
I saw in another thread that it's east Asia overall that's around 12% but that China is only 5% of that. I don't know how accurate all of that is, though.
Living in a country and agreeing with its politics are two different things.
>They support a dictator.

That kind of undermines what it means to be a dictator. It's less "support" than "obey lest you suffer the consequences".
...you do realize the US NFL just did essentially the same thing by unofficially banning Kapernick for protesting black murders by police officers right? And that‚Äôs a situation where consumer pressure literally pushed the business execs to do so and stop black players from nonviolent protest
No its not. They make around 5% from China.
lol what
China has made blizzard very little money dude.
[deleted]
Yep. That's all of Asia. China accounts to much less than that, about 5%.
Blizzard 2018 annual report. If you need more clarification of the Blizzard-China relationship here's an interesting quote from there as well:

>"A deterioration in relations between either us or the United States and any country in which we have significant operations or sales, or the implementation of government regulations in such a country, could result in the adoption or expansion of trade restrictions, including economic sanctions, that could have a negative impact on our business. For instance, to operate in China, all games must have regulatory approval. A decision by the Chinese government to revoke its approval for any of our games or to decline to approve any products we desire to sell in China in the future could have a negative impact on our business. Additionally, in the past, legislation has been implemented in China that has required modifications to our products. The future implementation of similar laws or regulations in China or any other country in which we have operations or sales may restrict or prohibit the sale of our products or may require engineering modifications to our products that are not cost-effective, if even feasible at all, or could degrade the consumer experience to the point where consumers cease to purchase such products. The Chinese game approval procedure was suspended from March 2018 until January 2019 and, due to the large number of pending applications, it remains uncertain as to if and when our new products will be approved for release in China. Further, the enforcement of regulations relating to mobile and other games with an online element in China remains uncertain, and further changes, either in the regulations or their enforcement, could have a negative impact on our business in China."

Tl;dr Blizzard is afraid that the Chinese government will revoke Blizzard's right to sell their games in China. This means that Blizzard has to maintain it's the relationship with China not only to keep it's Tencent/Chinese investors happy but American investors as well who know how important the Chinese market is for Blizzard.
lol
I do not know if this is /r/BoneAppleTea or not
Any time Blizzard does an oopsie Kern tries to use it to grab any relevancy he can, he tries to make it about him.

When somebody accuses a person of being alt-right, it's worthwhile to ask "Why are they alt-right, and not regular right?" to see if the person actually has an answer.
No one has a right to anyone's emotional or physical energy. Ever. At all. Under any circumstances.

That's not really up for debate.
GG is the reason "who gives a shit what game journos think" became common sense. Even people that hate the movement will laugh uproariously at the idea of taking RPG or Kotaku seriously.

[deleted]
Oh I remeber that game being pretty bad. His reported attitude back then is pretty awful, I'm surprised he's working on WoW classic. He must've learned some restraint but going to take whatever he says with a grain of salt going forward.
Well yeah it doesnt really matter since he is still at this very moment contributing to a good cause but i just find it weird how his name is suddenly a big deal
He literally said this: " As long as you are an employee, you don't.have to pay a wow sub, but since he has been long gone, he is subject to a subscription like any of us. "

&#x200B;

So based on what he said, Metzen pays a sub.
They have a tiny one in their mouth, but China's pocket is full of money.
Yeah, if we don't go back after a reasonable effort to fix it on blizzard's part, it just shows that the remaining player base is boycott proof and blizzard can be as pro china as they want with no fear of further repercussions.
I dont think you understand. Blizz might as well move everything to China now. They committed treason, there is only one punishment for treason. They literally called China ‚Äútheir country‚Äù on Twitter in Mandarin. There is no statement more treasonous. They can rot forever.
Yeah. When I cancelled my sub I urged them to reverse the decision. If they make a meaningful change I will come back.
> If some of us don't go back after they meet our demands, we're encouraging them to just double down on the original move.

Exactly. 

But getting to the point where timing will start to matter. The longer it takes the less likely people will be to go back
I think overwatch is already banned in China. Not sure if thats true but i saw a post which said it was. 

They are already banning players left and right. Some people were banned for 1000 years.... Such ridiculous bans. Their accounts are banned until 3019 october.
Then we should punsih people for just living in china then?  I mean what did the 600 million chinese gamers do that was worth a punishment.  Not line up to die?
I don't think China is going to ban them for toning down their punishment to something more reasonable, though they sure as hell have made it harder on themselves now.  They might take some heat there, but they're taking heat here, and China is a much smaller portion of their market.
[Sadly....](https://twitter.com/Aspharon/status/1181997373393907712)

This is also not a political belief fyi, it's a human rights violation. There is (or there should not be) politics when it comes to HUMAN RIGHTS.
Blizzard gave in to China's demands, and now to make up for it they have to flip on their decision and make China their enemy AND give in to fans demands and give them free shit?  So you just want Blizzard sucking the dick that benefits you.

Being pissed off at Blizzard is totally fair and reasonable.  *Demanding they give you shit* because they fucked up is not.  

If Blizzard issued a public apology to the winner and restored his winnings, apologized to the casters and gave any financial restitution they are owed, and publicly stated their stance "protecting Chinese interests" was wrong, that should be good enough.  They don't owe you, me or anyone other than the tornament winner and those casters anything.
What you said makes a lot of sense and is certainly more kind and moral.

But in the end, corporations almost never face any drastic consequences and are not afraid to continue being evil.

And when our opposition (China) commands such high levels of compliance, and is willing to go all in or bust to get their way, I don't think half measures are enough to sway companies to our side.

In reality, I accepted and understand that this will fizzle out just like everything else. But I DO wonder what it'd be like if they do face such severe consequences.
This isn't one mistake blizzard fell off years ago. You could argue StarCraft 2 or cataclysm were their first signs of disconnect from players and they started making worse and worse decisions. This is the last straw.
So not wanting chinese citizens who are just surviving to have more shit thrown their way is shilling for CCP?  How insane of an opinion is that.
The chief financial officer reports to Bobby Kotic, and Bobby Kotic alone.  We've seen reports from Blizzard employees about the state of their weekly meetings about how they need to cut costs.

Activision is the bigger company in the relationship, and they absolutely have influence over Blizzard.
That's a very fair point. Ultimately its on us to stick to our guns. But I'm afraid many won't.
Personally, I wouldn't go that far. Patch 8.2 made the expansion a lot better for me, but it doesn't save the expansion. Patch 8.3 does sound right up my alley.

I have said from the start that BfA could end up shedding it's title of worst expansion so far, though. But it has a few irreconcilable decisions that will always bug me, and the big one is how they butchered the story. So much of it *could* make sense if the story was told better, and a lot of the story *does* make more sense if you read the books and short stories. But how the non-Forsaken Horde went along with Sylvanas for so long is absolutely something that will be a black spot in the Warcraft lore for me.

But still, let's hope the next one is good, and that Blizzard has done enough to fix this absolutely embarrassing display of priorities.
> but now it's like really good, too good

Have you seen the 8.3 beta leaks? Because the store has pretty much gone to hell with this xpac.
They said that about BFA, if it was as good as Legion, etc.  Blizzard isn't good at making WoW anymore.
Legion was great to many, shit to.. also many. I loved it. BfA has been shit for a staggering amount of people right up until patch 8.2, when a decent number of people were mostly okay with the expansion. The next patch sounds great too, and the WoW team seems to have really taken a lot of the complaints to heart.

But since I can't trust videogame developers/publishers, I want to see the next expansion to see them deliver on their promises. As for Orgrimmar being dead, I can't say much about that. It makes sense, because Orgrimmar isn't the hub of the expansion. Even so, there are plenty of people in Stormwind on my cross-realms. You can't judge the state of the game too much by looking at capitals that aren't the focus of the expansion.
nostalgia is a hell of a drug
Maybe the real WoW killer was the business partners we made along the way
I still talk to my old crew and they still play a good bit and tell me how much better it's gotten since Cataclysm. It seemed like the game was maybe improving, but to me it seemed like they were just bending over backwards to cater to super casuals. Like, not being able to meticulously tweak my spec just how I like it is a pain in the ass.

Ultimately though, I logged on in Orgrimmar and it was only kind of busy counting players across the whole fuggin' battlegroup. Back in the day it would be packed with just the server pop. Also I set up a picnic table and nobody joined me.
Yeah. But no one could have imagined it going down this way. It's true fucking colours exposed. Well I guess that could be said of a corporate company since most of them are money mongers.
You might be right since different sites claim to say their version is gospel. But i found this stat to be most commonly mentioned so i went with it. Also chinese wow players contributrd the highest sub profit with almost 1/3 of the wow population ever to be chinese.

Apologies if im wrong.
When the Chinese people stand up and demand freedom, then I'll listen. Until then, they can all fucking pound sand.
You realize blizzard is owned by Activision right?
im still wondering how is the number so small? i still remember the news stories about the chinese wow gold farmers
It definitely was
He needs a behavior overhaul
He's definitely a "oh btw I helped make world of warcraft 15 years ago" kind of guy.
so he shouldn't have said anything \[publicly in this case\]?

Doesn't that make your list, like, really long?
What about the other employees who walked out? Dont shift the focus
they won't... or they'll just kneejerk call you a racist.
That‚Äôs the thing. Everyone who calls themselves conservative is automatically labeled alt right.
Saying that doesn't make it true. I could just as easily say the opposite and then say "that's not really up for debate" and I'd have made the same baseless argument that you just did.
Wheres the rape?
His side of the story.   https://twitter.com/Grummz/status/1181738905051123713
I dont know the real truth but i've been reading his twitter quite alot for the pass 2 years and he seems like a decent person
Nah just several statements from verified former employees. Witness statements are used as evidence in legal trials, but you don't count that as evidence? I bet even video proof wouldn't be enough for you, the only proof you would be fine with is seeing it in person.
Hes not on WoW Classic. He just worked on Vanilla. There is a difference.

Hes doing the 'spiritual successor' to Firefall. Worked well the first time. (EM-8R or something.)
I agree.
You bring a really interesting counterpoint. Bearing in mind the information I shared is what I have gathered over the years, and from looking at their benefits when browsing for jobs on their site, I stand by what I stated. That said, I would be inclined to think Metzen, Morhaime and some of the other more iconic people might be treated differently. After all, he still does voice over for Thrall and likely has connections with plenty of people there, so much so he also attended BlizzCon after having retired.

Now, if there is any evidence to the contrary, please do share. I will gladly look over it and change my stance. Take care.
They can move to China. Its a Chinese company now.
No they didn't. First of all, that wasn't even Twitter, it was Weibo. Secondly, it wasn't even from Blizzard it was from Netease which is a Chinese game company. But spreading lies fits your agenda better I guess.
Definitely. Also, what happens if the Mei thing succeeds and China bans them anyway? It's a very awkward position since they'd then come back to the west, but clearly not of their own volition.
China actually did reprimand the NBA for slightly backtracking and has still stopped supporting the houston rockets.

They really are that petty.
Between this, the NBA, and the Trade War it's highly likely we'll be treating China like the Soviet Union going forward. And rightfully so. We never should have propped up a communist regime.
Yeah thats nuts. And youre right ill agree its not political. Poor choice of words on my part. Im assuming(hoping?) the division that wrote that is seperate from the NA division. Lack of response is prettttyyyyy damning tho
> They don't owe you, me or anyone other than the tornament winner and those casters anything.

Depends on if they want that guys money. If he deems it necessary as a customer, then they do owe it to him, if they want his business. Both sides are free to walk away.
Kotick is CEO of Activision Blizzard not of Activision.
What changed in 8.2 and what will change in 8.3?
When the Chinese people stand up and demand freedom, they get massacred. There are a number of these incidents documented, most notably Tienanmen square. There are probably more that the Chinese government succeded in hushing up before information got out
Yes what is your point, we are having a discussion about something completeing different than what you posted. I think you're confused where you are
Because chinese wow gold farmers steal western accounts mostly as it's the most profitable way to farm gold. Plus in current WoW gold is pretty meaningless and the WoW token really put a damper on gold selling as well
Yeah, you aren't ever going to 'win an argument' with somebody on the internet, but if that's all they can manage, everybody will see the truth.
Yeah, I haven't changed my political views much since the 90's, and somehow in that time I've been like 10 different things.

i downvoted you. however, i did not downvote you because of your opinion or statement. i downvoted you due to your willful ignorance of the purpose of protest.
FWIW, NetEase controls *all* operations in the Asia-Pacific region; they ran the tournament, cut the tournament video feed, and made the call to ban Blitzchung... but who the hell cares about facts when there's outrage to be had?

ATVI could fight back against their own publishing partner, but say goodbye to eastern markets, a third of their revenue stream, and likely several employees/future projects as a result of profit loss.
That was an official Blizzard account managed by Netease that released that statement so if Blizzard doesn't support that statement then they need to say something. I'll wait. \*crickets\*
The NBA backtracked off all formal punishments though right?  I feel most of us here would be fine with a situation where a fine or something still happens.
All the lackeys are so anxious to prove themselves to the party there's no room for compromise.

I bet Xi is shitting his pants. All these people who didn't care about China will be watching TV when he rolls his tanks into Hong Kong, and he'll get to build his totalitarian state with a lot less money.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't be surprised if we ended up recognizing Taiwan and formalizing our defense treaty.
8.2 added the Mechagon and Nazjatar zones, which offer a decent bit of content to work through. It also unlocked all Azerite traits on Azerite gear by default, instead making the Heart of Azeroth kinda like an artifact necklace, but with a glyph system instead of a trait system. Meaning you can go out and unlock abilities and passives to put onto the necklace. They also added a kind of deterministic loot, though with its own flaws and criticisms.

8.3 will add assaults in Uldum and the Vale of Eternal Blossoms with N'zoth's minions. There will also be a feature that is sort of like the Deaths of Chromie content, except you can do it with 1-5 players. There will also be a shitload of currencies with which you can buy what you want to buy, though I don't know if it'll be like the loot mentioned above, or if it will truly be deterministic. Ion Hazzikostas has also spoken about possible changes coming to titanforging, though they're still discussing this internally. 

That's the important bits. Of course, 8.2 had the Azshara raid and a mega-dungeon like Karazhan, and 8.3 will have the Ny'alotha raid. Oh, and Wrathion will finally return. And immediately offer us a quest to get a new legendary cloak.

But the TL;DR of the changes to the WoW team's design philosophy obviously lie in giving us a way to more easily get loot we want and need, and in at least discussing titanforging, which we've been complaining about for so goddamn long now.
Then they lost and i have no sympathy for them. They‚Äôve let themselves be enslaved by ideology.
The "liberals" out there had their brains broken by Trump winning in 2016. I wish there were more level-headed people on the left like Dave Rubin and Tim Pool. I just can't deal with all the bs out there these days. Refuse to engage anyone anymore if I detect a whiff of TDS.
What fucking mental gymnastics do you have to pull to make ‚Äúright to have sex‚Äù into ‚Äúrape apologist‚Äù? 

Jesus Christ everyone has a right to sex as long as the other party involves convents. Both parties involved have a right to sex, if a person says no that doesn‚Äôt mean the other party has their right to sex taken away from them nor does it mean that person gets to rape the other. All it means is that sex is a basic biological function and a person is allowed to fucking want sex no matter what race, culture, beliefs, etc they have.

This isn‚Äôt fucking rocket science.
You so made it up.
=/= right to rape.

Anything else you want to reach for? Should i get the ladder so its easier?
So the time when Mark Kern harassed women on twitter isn't proof of him being a sad excuse of a human being? Or the time when he got banned from Twitter due to racist tweets? Or the time when he was overly sexist on Twitter? Tweets that he has since deleted but can be found through wayback machine if you want to dig a little. Yea, of course the game is dead even after the board voted him out of the company... The game was already fucked up beyond all repair due to him. Do you think a game suddenly becomes good the moment you change CEO? That's not how game development works. They spent years on that game with Mark changing the direction on a whim and the end product was shit, the board voted Mark out but the damage was already done. Let's also just ignore the fact that Mark threw away $3 million on a promotional bus that never was used and just collected dust in a warehouse. Oh and while we are on the topic of China and such, should we also ignore the fact that Mark sold out to a chinese company to try to save the company from bankcruptcy but that ultimately didn't help due to him being an incompetent CEO? 

EVERYONE that has ever worked under him says the same things about all the horrible shit he did as a CEO, all point to him being a huge douchebag. It's also funny that the only time he is ever in the spotlight is when there's a gaming controversy going on, he always tries to inject himself into everything and always runs around yelling "I WAS TEAM LEAD FOR VANILLA WOW" like that even matters anymore.
Pray tell, precicely how did you come to the conclusion that he is being willfully ignorant?
Their asian market is 12% of their revenue. China < 10%.
That was an official Blizzard account managed by Netease that released that statement so if Blizzard doesn't support that statement then they need to say something. Should we hold our breath?
Also fun fact: NetEase ran the Chinese OWL Team ‚ÄúShanghai Dragons‚Äù last year, which was infamous for going 0-40
That was a Netease account managed by Netease.
There was no formal punishment, Morey was just told to pull his tweet and apologize, which he (or someone at the NBA under his name) did. What Silvers did was claim NBA was pro-free speech after the censorship and apologies, which just upset China again. I don't think Morey has been allowed to speak his mind again, at least not on twitter like he did originally. So now the NBA has the US and China pissed, pretty bad situation all around.
>I feel most of us here would be fine with a situation where a fine or something still happens.

I think you are out of touch with how most  of us here feel. Any punishment is unreasonable, and a public apology plus a penalty are what are called for at this point.
How is not wanting to have you and your family killed being enslaved by an ideology?  I'm sure many don't agree with the government but what can they do unless they want to die for a hopeless cause?  Do you think the same for North Koreon people too?
lol, must be really easy to hold such lofty ideals. Let me guess you are between the ages of 16-25 and grew up not knowing strife?
I think what's really changed is social media. It used to be you were a liberal until you were 29-32, then you got a real job and didn't have the time or energy to argue politics with little kids.  But now that we have social media, you've got 3-4 generations in each other's faces talking about politics all at once.  

Dave Rubin didn't undergo some amazing political reformation, he just stopped being college-age.
Don‚Äôt you know the 2nd Amendment allows you to force people to give you a gun? It is the ‚Äúright to bear arms‚Äù, after all.
lmao so triggered
"right to sex" is vile incel talk. no one else says shit like this.
[deleted]
because the person he replied to explained in what i consider good enough detail why continuing to punish a company after they revert their decision is not how you enact long term change.

>Yeah, if we don't go back after a reasonable effort to fix it on blizzard's part, it just shows that the remaining player base is boycott proof and blizzard can be as pro china as they want with no fear of further repercussions.
Of *Activision-Blizzard* (the parent company) entirely yes, because that number is calculated across all sub-studios and products which market much higher in the west, though AP & China contribute significantly more revenue to *Blizzard Entertainment* (the actual studio) itself, which creates Warcraft, Diablo, Starcraft, Heroes, Overwatch, and Hearthstone.

[Source](https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-announces-fourth-quarter-and-2018-financial): Over 30%, when you look at Net Revenue divided by sub-company (Activision, Blizzard, and King individually).

Keep in mind they're also on the verge of a major new release largely aimed toward eastern audiences - while mobile games are often derided in the west, despite being extremely profitable, they're even bigger in the Asia Pacific, especially China which is a market which few western developers have managed to penetrate.
They do need to say something, but that's not the point - the point is that people should not conflate a Chinese publisher, run by the Chinese state, making a pro-Chinese statement, on a Chinese media platform, *in China*, with the western company that they have a publishing deal with.

Is it still bad for Blizzard? Certainly, but it's not like J. Allen Brack or Bobby Kotick were tweeting out "GO CHINA!", and framing it that way simply to push this preposterous narrative is disingenuous at best. As for Blizzard not supporting it, I don't think any reasonable person in their right mind thinks that Activision or Blizzard support the way the Chinese government governs their people, just like the U.S. doesn't support the way Saudi Arabia treats its people, yet continues to do business with them.

The unfortunate truth is that the cost of getting involved with *another governments* politics would be so disastrous to their business that they might as well pack up shop and start handing out pink slips, because they're all going to end up unemployed. The even more unfortunate truth is that Blizzard should have never been involved in this situation in the first place - they only are because Blitzchung **forced** them into it, which is exactly why he was banned and precisely why those rules against it exist in the first place.
NetEase runs literally *everything* related to Blizzard in the east:

* The PR
* The Teams
* The Tournaments
* The Rules
* The Prizes

**Literally everything**, because they have a licence to do so. Yet people still insist on conflating them with Blizzard Ent (the studio) or ATVI (the parent company). It'd be like if something in the shitty Game of Thrones Web Browser game was considered to be coming from GRRM himself, which is equally ludicrous.
It is a Blizzard branded account. So Blizzard needs to either de-brand that account or they need to dispute the statement by the account.
I think you‚Äôre assuming ‚Äòmost‚Äô just as much as I am.
Lmao 0 argument
Learn to express yourself like an adult if you want anybody to care what you think.



>Oh no, he "harassed" wahmen?? I mean we all know both genders get flak, but you guys seem to think women & PoC are incapable of dealing with it the way their white male counterparts do. Almost like you think of them as lesser beings or something ü§îü§î


I feel like you didn't intend for this to read as both sexist and racist but....
Pray tell, how the widely accepted punishment for treason is intended to enact long term change? Its a societal one, not one for the offender to be redeemed from.
Of course I am. As long as you are aware it's an assumption.

1. blizzard doing what it did is not [treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason).
2. boycotting is not a punishment for treason, never has been. punishment for [treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason) usually involves jail time.
3. i replied to you replying to someone saying how continued boycotting of a business after they corrected their error and changed their ways is not how boycotting works. (in more words than that) not anything about treason.
4. your reply was ignoring his/her whole point and snidely saying, that they can go back where they came from in essence. 
5. which is why i down-voted you and explained why, i apologize for not making that post clear enough.

does that work?
Even in this reply you establish women and PoC as the outliers and white males as the standard. There are women, there are PoC, and then there's "everyone else"? 

You're the one lumping people in to catagories, catagories of people that should really try to handle things more like white dudes.
