It's the same picture!
But these pictures are both of the same person? I personally see no difference.
The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: 六四事件, liùsì shìjiàn), were student-led demonstrations in Beijing (the capital of the People's Republic of China) for the establishment of basic human and press rights and against the Communist-led Chinese government in mid-1989. More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.
Lovely work, Pede

Blizzard should watch South Park episode The Band. They might learn something
I know the answer, but is he trying to look like Mao Zedong?
That last frame, just amazing lmao
CEO of totalitarism
Omg that lost photo, she looks like piglett lmfao
Welp I cancelled my wow vanilla sub and hopefully I can be back soon, when blizzard starts respecting human rights above sucking Xi's cock (no offence to my fellow cock-suckers)
Xi jinpooh
I dont get it
Godamn he’s ugly
Why bring in that girl? I don't like the dictatorship but why bring that person?
I dont see the resemblance. Just the beady eyes. That's it
Right? Winnie the pooh is awesome!
Me too. It's cute af
Why is it even illegal I mean anything regarding pooh over there?
I’m also glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family’s organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
🤔
~~I think you dropped your "/s"~~

I get it now.
What is this, I'm seeing it everywhere?
[deleted]
If you look closely, you can tell the one on the right is a cartoon bear.
HAHAHAHAH
Hong Kong 4 life! But what will happen at 2047 :( You know once you're democracy and get used to that lifestyle you can never go back! Maybe the U.S. president at that time will be nice and let all hong kongers come live here in a freeee country :)
You're going to be waiting for a very long time. Companies that stoop this low never stand back up.
He really doesn't.  But he hates it and that's enough for me.

I think it's more the original image (I assume it's the origin). Here's one of the first links I found when I just searched it.

Pooh himself is not the problem.  He's cute and lovable and I doubt Xi minds being portrayed as such.

He was banned because people can use Pooh cartoons as an indirect way of criticizing the government.  That's where the problem lies.
HELL YEAH IT IS

FUCK CHINA
Cuz it bothers him. Literally the only reason.
I think the last 2/3 of the comment suffice. :)

Edit: added the happy lil :) to make it clear I wasn’t trying to be a douche.
...
boi are you stupid
Copypasta of Chinese human rights violations.
a copypasta of CCP crimes, and if you paste it into game chat with an annoying Chinese person their connection will drop. It's the new version of Taiwan Numbah One, but better.
The comment you're replying to is on your side. Unless they've edited it, I think you've misunderstood.
I thought that was a fucking clown! 
But if i squint my eyes and tilt my head i can see the cartoon bear!
Same.. as long as he hates it I'm happy and will continue to enjoy it.
The wonderful about uighurs, is uighurs are wonderful things. Their tops are made out of Transplantable Organs, their bottoms are bound together with chains! 

They’re expendable, bendable, killable, sellable, genocide is fun fun fun fun fun! 
 
But the most wonderful thing about uighurs is Cheap Transplantable Organs for everyone!!
Winnie the Pooh is wholesome and friendly character who wants to eat honey and be friends.  
Xinnie the Shit is a psychopathic tyrant who wants to commit genocide and be feared.
nah, cuteness is non-existence in totalitarianism, CCP considers anything cute as an insult to their authority
>That's where the problem lies.

No it's not a problem. Only to the warped minds in China is it a problem.  


But it's not a problem, at all.
Oh, Bother
Yeah I kept seeing it elsewhere and then realized its true meaning.
That guy just said you and my comments were propaganda and were from the chinese govt haha. Insane.
yo wtf is this
Damn~
Perhaps the inaccuracy of the comparison is why it irks him so.
There's a difference between looking nice and being nice.

China has been harvesting organs from Uighur muslims imprisoned in "containment camps".
The Wonderful thing about Tiggers song from winnie the pooh mixed up to be about the recent genocide by the Chinese. 

&nbsp;

>The wonderful thing about tiggers
Is tiggers are wonderful things!
Their tops are made out of rubber
Their bottoms are made out of springs!
They're bouncy, trouncy, flouncy, pouncy
Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun!
But the most wonderful thing about tiggers is
I'm the only one
Haha ok that's a decent excuse. Apology accepted. Carry on
Not new most prisoners are killed and their organs harvested in China. Not having human rights means you could do anything you want.
