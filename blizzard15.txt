I love WoW and this really hurts right now

&#x200B;

Im not deleting anything, but i wont sub or play it. I cant go that far. I hope something big blows up with Blizzcon. This is a really shitty situation
Hate to break it to you but Roblox is partnered with tencent. They also have a foot in China and haven't made any statement supporting human rights.

rofl thanks for this
Not all heros wear capes.
So let me get this straight.

You saw a WoW card, decided to whip out your camera, record yourself moving a different card in front of the the WoW card, in order to get karma on reddit.

Are you going to do this for *every* store that has this display and post it on reddit? I get the boycott but eesh, /r/cringe.
I know I am!  Renewed my wow sub. Bought some ow loot boxes. Even put money into hots.
Well boys, we did it. Activision-Blizzard is no more
Wow, your actions really helped the struggle in Hong Kong.  
What a martyr you are, grow up and let people make their own choices.  


I for one still happily play WoW because the struggle in Hong Kong is a problem for the people in Hong Kong.
Yeah that’ll show em
I’m impressed of how much no difference this makes
China destroyed, HK liberated
Doing your part by trolling the poor bloke who's gotta inventory those cards?
I just wanna throw this out there and while I know some of you may know I side with the streamers on this I want to be clear. Blizzard is a business and any business is going to do what is the profitable choice when they are given the options so long as what they're doing isn't illegal. So they made the best business decision they could make. But they most definitely didn't make the right choice when it came to what's right or wrong. That being said as someone who's worked with their team I can tell you they aren't bad people and this isn't something that reflects the entire company and all of it's employees. It's the person who made the call that should be frowned upon here if yall are going to be pointing the finger. 

&#x200B;

I say this with experience and knowledge from college business courses and working with companies. 

&#x200B;

Sorry that a company did something that companies do but when it comes to money time and time again through out history so long as it's not illegal a company/business will chose the most profitable option every time without a doubt.
Please don't be the ass hole who does this and makes it some stupid trend.
China resigns!

I don't see the moral victory here.
How Roblox is that popular? I literally never heard of it until on a video a few weeks ago. Could be that just is not played in EU?
This is just silly ofcourse he gets banned for pushing political opinion in a VIDEO GAME tournament. yes its for a good cause but how would you feel if they had to allow people to have their political opinions there and some neonazi comes up. grow up people blizzard is a company not your buddy.

roblox good
Lmao no, I'm not. I'm not gonna play a shittier game because capitalism sucks.

You wanna help Blizzard's actions regarding HK?

Change our worship of money.
Can someone please explain? i'm confused
Yes, fight the Chinese lackey with the white supremacist recruiting tool for children.
I cringed at the immaturity of this
I bought a game card like a week before shit went down and it's like..  .they already have my money, do I play or not.
Yeah! This will hit them where it hurts /rollseyes
Godspeed, hero.
Way to make it harder for the people who work in retail. You do know those cards are already paid for in wholesale and the profits you are now denying is the store trying to sell them right? SMH
Wow I can see the news title now! “Grown man puts Roblox gift card in front of WoW one, Chinese government capitulates.” Yet another low effort circlejerk karma whoring post. You are a disgrace and are using the actual human suffering in Hong Kong to gain fake internet points, congratulations.
*oh man you're literally changing the world!*
This is stupid
What people fail to understand is that even if blizzard goes against china openly then the things happening in Hong Kong are not going to stop.

Blizzard cant do anything to stop them, not on their own.


Hell if even chinese themselves can't do shit for it (and we're talking about BILIONS of people) you might aswell understand that 4700 people wont change anything.


EVERYONE has to stand up and drop them so that they'd be left alone with no international market unless things change, and that, is not something 1 industry alone can do.

Blizzard taking action wasnt a way to support what the Chinese government is doing, Blizzard action was something to PROTECT themselves from having a hard drop in income by getting banned in china.

Again, it doesnt mean Blizzard supports them, it means Blizzard can't do shit on their own without risking to to bankrupt since China is the biggest country there is and the gaming scene there is so huge that you'd be losing more money than what you earn.


I'm saying this as someone who has never played a blizzard game beside overwatch, so you cant even define me as a blizzard cocksucker or however you call them.

You people need to understand the way the world goes, nothing is as easy as you think it is and, even if it sucks, there's nothing we can do unless plenty of other industries and companies take actions on that.
Congrats, you beat China.
So edgy!
Yeah im thinking of pre purchasing war3 refirged
As much as I dislike Blizzard, Roblox seems to be increasing the chance your child grows up mentally deficit as well.

Would you like to know more?

Ah so you can assume that the components come from overseas.  But there is no way for me to know otherwise?  Why dont you think about that for a minute.  Burden of proof is on the accuser as they say.
Somehow I always thought Roblox would overtake WoW and now here we are. Roblox > Overwatch
This whole situation sucks, I loved blizzard since wow vanilla came out and have been playing their games since, I enjoy most of their games and do have an active wow subscription. It ends in a few days so I might just wait out the situation to see if I should purchase more or not. This has severely wrecked blizzards reputation
THERE GOES MY HERO
stop
I'm never going to waste one second of my life on roblox ever
I’ve never seen wow cards stacked with such numbers before lol
Classic Roblox servers when?
Source store. Nice.
Add a second card just in case someone decided to get robux from game(stop)
This gave such a starship troopers vibe!
I stopped playing blizzard games since this happened!
Derp derp derp I cancel my subs and oppose blizzard for supporting evil China. Me have selective outrage because me cant think clearly. Me hate blizzard now but like other games like Roblox derp derp herp me support Roblox is good company.

Hey guys look at me I am replacing one money hungry company who wants money from China with ROBLOX who is totally not also a money hungry company that wants money from China. Helping!!!! Derp
That's just sad
Thank you

They need to learn there lesson but this is just dumb.

"Oops we better bow to financial pressure from an oppressive and murderous regime that gets upset over a cartoon bear. What's the worst that could happen?" -some idiot at Blizzard 2019.
I’m doing my part!
My blizzard game with the most time on it used to be destiny but now all I had there was hearthstone. It has been uninstalled and blizzard removed from my PC
The hero we need but do not deserve!
Here is a more effective bit of sabotage. Collect them all and hide them in another part of the store behind completely different merchandise.
Hahahahahahaha. It is very cool see the youth doing something like this as long as you guys do not go to far and get innocent people fired just because you disagree with them, but this is different of course.
The thumbs up, lovin it !
As much as I love overwatch, I'm not going to play a single game from them unless they fix this...which is unlikely seeing they have backed themselves into a corner.
hahahah ok i got a good laugh on that. I'm sure those blizz gift cards wont be noticed for a long while.
DONT LET THE FLAME DIE OUT
I just unsubscribed. I feel like right now blizzard no longer represents my interests as a gamer. I'll be watching to see how this continues to play out.
the post itself is hella funny but the people getting irrationally mad at this in the comments really makes it
Good message, but the retail employees are gonna be pissed lol (I currently work in retail and it always makes me wonder why people pick something up and place it beside the item instead of where it belongs).
This is the most effective market tatic i'ver seen.
You made that look difficult...
Hahahahhaa good one!
i'm "doing my part" by typing letters on the internet.

where's my "doing my part" score? i gotta be up to like 12 by now.

Guys I was just trying to be funny, I realise that I won't crumble the Chinese government with my extra lazy form of protest
Would stealing gift cards actually be a crime? It says right on most cards that they have NO VALUE until activated by a cashier. So, how is taking something of no value from a store a crime? Maybe someone in law enforcement can answer this. Pretty much a daft question.

EDIT: so I get downvoted for asking a legitiment question. People really suck.
OP is getting a lot of hate from people that a missing one important thing.  Many of those cards are just "promotional" and have no value other than to bring it to the counter so the employee can fetch the actual card with the scratch code from the drawer/cabinet/back room.  If it does contain a code on the promo card, it requires activation and has zero value otherwise, and payment usually happens on activation.

Source: Worked at far too many places with such cards.
Even if people think this is dumb and pointless, it's at least a small thing, which is more than doing nothing
Most blizzard games don't like my pc atm so I play them very little atm
Yet people will still pay/support this corrupted company, just to have their share of entertainment (especially wow players). They don't realize that, if you still have an account, you are supporting the exact things you are against. Disgusted.
u respect da roblox community

&#x200B;

thank u
Howdy Blizz-Brother!

Just wanted to chime in that you are not alone. This whole thing happened just before my decision to move to vanilla from retail, but I still felt strongly enough to cancel my sub and remove [battle.net](https://battle.net) from my pc (the games are still on my hds, don't see the point of deleting them yet). I do plan on returning, but I want to see an apology of sorts from Blizzard first. I'm happy to wait until that day comes.

I can't in good conscience give money to a company that supports a fascist 'communist' dictatorship over the basic human right to freedom of speech of their own loyal fanbase. 

I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in a company, and that's saying something (looking at you, EA gambling)
I deleted my account. I was an active overwatch player but I tried playing the day after they banned Blitzchung and I just felt guilty. Even if I wasn’t buying anything, me playing the game was supporting the company by making their matchmaking pool bigger. After their pseudo apology, I realized I couldn’t support the company going forward and decided to delete my account. It was tough because I own all of their games and poured a lot of time into WoW, Diablo and Overwatch but I don’t see Blizzard changing their position on this one. It’s sad a company I’ve supported for 25 years had to be so shitty and greedy I couldn’t enjoy their games anymore.
So much of my life has been wasted on WoW... I’d never delete my account. Seems extreme, especially if they make an apology. So I’m just gonna have to buy the games again if that happens?
Cancelled my subscription, I will not resubscribe until they do something to change my view on them.
Many of us are in the same boat. I grew up with Blizzard from the early days and have paid for every game they have developed just because "it is Blizzard". I have bought the virtual ticket to every single Blizzcon possible and this hurts so much. 

I have not deleted anything but I have quit playing all Blizzard games and canceled my WoW sub. I need to see something from Blizzard showing they really know this is fucked up.
I’m not deleting anything except my card info from my account. I won’t be paying them another cent, by my old blizzard games are MINE and I don’t want to lose them.
If you don't play, you can either unsub manually, so that you can submit a message, or uninstall the Blizzard Client (don't worry, wow won't uninstall) so that their statistics show that.
It's fine, I did not delete mine either, but I've committed to not touching it until we get a real solution.

I'm sure they are betting on most people getting tired by Blizzcon, and swayed back by announcements like the new WoW expansion, Diablo 4, or WC3 reforged.

Do not yield. Don't even give their stream a view, any news site will cover all the reveals the second they happen. Do not be tempted to come back no matter how cool things look.
Fair enough, I’m equally disgusted. Such wonderful memories and enjoyment from Blizzard. I have to remind myself, this is NOT blizzard anymore. It helps... a tiny bit
Looking at viewer counts on twitch nothing has changed. Except I am saving tons of money having quit hearthstone. :3
I feel bad. It is like being angry at a family member. You can’t accept their position but hate that it is pushing you apart.

I want to buy the Blizzcon stream but can’t justify supporting Blizzard.
I already canceled but I’m playing it out to the end of my subscription. Not sure if I should have uninstalled but I think Blizzard cares about their $$$ taking a dip more than the number of active players, but who can say. 

I’m also using the opportunity to spread the word without spamming - just making the occasional joke or meme in general and when people ask for clarification I explain. Basically keeping it in the conversation. It’s shocking how many players on my server have no idea and don’t follow the news, but are very open to hearing about it. 

On a side note, one of my lame jokes in general chat was that someone should make a <Liberate Hong Kong> guild and see if Blizzard gm’s ban them. I was a member of one of the largest Alliance guilds on my server, The Goonies, and they banned me for criticizing the Chinese government for “racism”:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dhl0sz/one_of_the_largest_guilds_windseeker_just_banned/
True.  This may sound mean but I think it is outright stupid to delete an account due to this, with the reason being that you already paid money, so just stop giving them money.  That means letting your wow sub lapse but you can still play diablo just dont buy any future games.

A boycott is for purely economical terms, and in no uncertain terms, just means stop buying from them.

With all that said, i am with hong kong and am waiting for blizzard to apologize and give blitzchung back his seat.  Besides that i let my wow sub lapse and have stopped playing blizz games all together, but if i want i might go back to diablo
I'm lucky enough that I hadn't started playing before all this happened, but I was going to get Overwatch when it came to Switch. Not anymore. I want them to completely change their actions before I give them a cent of my money.
Something big is definitely happening at Blizzcon.

Not because of the Blitzchung controversy, but more likely because of how lackluster and how much of a joke Blizzcon 2018 was.

There will be MANY new game reveals.  New WoW expansion, OW2, D4 at the very least.

But if we are so easily appeased by such (albeit exciting) news, then maybe we were never that dedicated to supporting HK and boycotting Blizzard from the beginning.

Remember the criticism of Blizzard:  they only support social progress and causes when doing so cost them nothing.

That's no support at all.

Careful not to do the same ourselves:  that we only boycott Blizzard until a game we are excited about comes out.

That's no boycott at all.
How about a normal blizzcon for the sake of the ppl going.. thanks
I deleted the account I had since 2010. That said, its perfectly fine not deleting anything. It's your choice. Support however you can.
This all happened right after I joined my colleges Overwatch esports team. Great timing lol
I just wanted to congratulate you for not playing WoW! High five, takes some balls.
Hey man, lets not forget that the people at Blizzcon aren’t the people who are responsible for this. It’s still okay for fans to support games they love made by people who love to make em’. The devs in LA aren’t the Chinese government.
Psh. I’m still playing because I like the games. Don’t give a shit about the company. 

What’s also funny, is the insane amount of people playing cod mobile. Made in china, having an activision brand. People are just stupid. Post this stuff for karma points only. Then continue to “not play wow” or “not play black ops 4” yeah right. 
I’m sure some people actually boycotted. But let’s be real, Reddit is small compared to blizzard game owners. And reddit is filled with *ill follow the trend bruh* people.
You could say it's a... shituation
just play a private server

There's already a big protest planned at Blizzcon with a [website up](https://www.gamersforfreedom.com/) and everything.

To be fair..... Blizzard's not letting a lot of folks delete their accounts even if they want to.

Its hilarious that people are boycotting Blizzard and not other companies. Literally 2IQ echo chamber fuckwits.
I just picked whatever card was next to it, unfortunately I didn't do my research on every company's position on China.
And even if they weren't. The only ones being hurt by this is the local store where he did this.

Some guy comes in to buy a Game time and can't find it because of the Roblox card, he goes elsewhere. Or buys it online. Hiding the card will at best delay the purchase from a determined customer (No one impulse buys gametime) and at worst cause them to buy it directly from the Blizzard store instead where they get a better margin.
Let’s just mission creep our way to a point of such generalization that nothing has enough of an effect to matter!  Being focused gets the job done. Don’t be pedantic. We’re talking to Blizzard right now.
But Epic Games CEO did, and Tencent owns 40% of Epic Games.
I wear capes sometimes
This one might as well wear it.

congratulations, you found the joke
if the guy whipped out a MAGA hat and started talking about immigration, and Blizzard banned him, all these fools would be cheering
Soon the CCP will come for you and nobody will be left to speak up for you.  
EDIT: Good to see Blizzard fans care more about their Overwatch loot boxes than human rights.
If these people actually gave a shit about whats happening in Hong Kong surely they'd be doing a lot more than talking about it on the internet? Surely?
I highly doubt you **happily** play WoW still.
No one inventories those cards. They aren't active until they're scanned at the register. People walk out with them all the time to keep as gifts to activate later because of this. And even this is rare. 

Companies that put these cards out, dont care either. They're usually made of cheap ass plastic or cardstock. 

Shops literally only care to order more when they're running low.
If it makes you feel better I work there so I'm the poor bloke
mate chill, they're not doing inventory on gift cards that don't even have money on them. The cards themselves are worthless until they are activated
I don’t think 1 card is going to piss anyone off doing inventory...5+ cars sure but 1 card you take 1 second moving back over is harmless.
This. I wish folks like OP know that his action is just like the PRCs who vandalized Japanese car brands in China - they think they are harming Japan when all they are doing is to hurt their countrymen
Most of those "poor blokes" are looking for something to do till work time is over. This is perfect.
> Blizzard is a business and any business is going to do what is the profitable choice when they are given the options so long as what they're doing isn't illegal.

No, _some_ businesses do that. Not all. Some actually mean it when they say they have principles and values. 

It is perfectly valid to hold a business or corporation to moral standards and expect or demand that ethical behaviour from them -- even when that ethical behaviour might make a dent in their bottom line.
It's really strange how corporations have somehow managed to trick us into defending their horrible actions. 

>Bob makes tshirts, he uses third world child slave labor to have lower costs. Bob is evil

People know businesses try to make profit, its not a surprise to anyone. However people place trust into certain brands and uphold them to standards when repeatedly supporting them. If that trust is broken then that company loses the loyalty of those customers. Theres absolutely nothing wrong with this happening because it somewhat restricts companies to some moral standards.  

When I used to buy blizzard games I was okay with overlooking some anticonstumer stuff because I trusted the company. Now however I've removed that trust (its slowly been going away over the years) and highly doubt I'll ever touch another blizzard product.

This ridiculous idea that companies should be continue to receive our support for being greedy doesn't make sense. If I have a choice to support a morally sound company I'll chose that one over an evil one every time (It's video games so gladly my choices are very expansive). 

Blizzard did something shitty, it doesnt matter if they're a company. Continue supporting them if its not a big deal to you but don't try to write off their behavior.
Then it's our job to make doing the wrong thing less profitable.

They can choose me or China.  They're apparently not getting both.
While I understand your point, you're not entirely correct imo.

Business don't always make the most profitable decision, case in point Google decided to pull out of China  entirely 9 years ago due to similar ethical problems and have undoubtedly lost a lot of profit as a result. It is possible for companies to put morals over profits and its well within the consumers rights to choose what products they buy into based on these morals.

Additionally the Blizzard situation is a bit more complicated than making the best business decision imo. I think they could have have easily dealt with the situation in such a way that satisfied China without clearly taking a stance on the political issue at hand. Had they just removed the vod, given the player a slap on the wrist punishment and said "regardless of the message, we don't want our platform to be taken over by political agendas" I doubt there would be anywhere near as much uproar on the issue.

The problem I have (and presumably many others) is that they have not taken a neutral stance on the political issue at hand imo, but instead seem to have very heavily taken the side of an authoritarian government vs a freedom movement.

I 100% agree with you though that this doesn't reflect on the staff working at Blizzard. It's asinine to think the developers of the games have any responsibility to a political/management action taken on the other side of the world. But it does reflect on the company's ethics as a whole, and the priorities of those with the power to make decisions.

Don’t even try to use common sense on reddit, just embrace the outrage culture or else be prepared to lose fake internet points.
Yes, companies go for profit, it's their purpose. But still this doesn't mean they are soulless constructs completely detached of any understanding of humanism. After all, economics and businesses are there to give human existence a structure and a better quality of life. If you think you should make money off of the suffering of other people, then you have failed as company, and as individual.
Just to be clear I'm not stating that there are only two options that exist. Also there's no way for us to discuss the specifics they considered so I can't sit here and detail all the options Blizzard had to chose from being that I don't have such internal knowledge and if I did I wouldn't be able to disclose that due to their own company policies pertaining to such things.

As to all the other replies saying some businesses do that or things such as not all companies should do that e.c.t.. yeah that might be true but this isn't just any company. We're talking about a specific company not other businesses or some businesses. It's a larger discussion to discuss what companies should and shouldn't do when it comes to ethical decisions and organizational behavior.

We're discussing a specific business choice that was made by a specific company for a specific reason(s) which we can only assume was based off of profit or the good of the company because when Blizzard has hundreds of millions of dollars in potential profit that hang on Blizzard choosing to do something Blizzard is going to chose what makes them the most money because telling share-holders we chose not making hundreds of millions in profit and to instead become closed off to billions of potential customers it doesn't sound good to investors.

They care about their investors so they're going to make the choices that best benefit their investors. Also there's probably various equations which were solved by a variety of well-paid professionals who analyzed the situation and decided this was the best path forward for the company. Also you have to consider the safety of those who are working for Blizzard in China if all of a sudden they're now seen as slanderers of the state based off of Blizzard taking a stand. So while you and I would want Blizzard to take a stand against China and support those people going through a bunch of BS that's not something that they're company is designed to do.

They are first of foremost a video game company so for them to step into politics in a foreign country would not be appropriate because it's beyond their area of expertise.

Though if they had subject matter experts hired to their team to analyze the politics of a foreign nation so that they could take a stand in a way that wouldn't negatively impact their business in China they'd be capable of making educated decisions that were acceptable and not cause such an uproar.
The “victims” also broke their contract
Lol, a couple decades back and Blizzard would have been run into the ground for supporting a communist dictatorship.
Blizzard did not start that way. Particularly since Activision they became that.
You said it all.
A good business follows ethical and moral understanding... not to mention when the whole base tells you diablo immortal was a stupid move... its best you be a good business and listen
"Eh they had to chase profit so it's ok they endorse authoritarians who are denying human rights.

THis will look terrible when tiannamen 2 happens.
Considering some of the changes coming to China and data security over there we very well might see entities like Bliz decide to jump ship on the market anyways. 1 Billion customers is great and all but not if you have to transmit all your server and login data unencrypted so the government can spy on it.

hello blizzard employee
amazing how taking a class at a community college and working the fryer at McDonald's makes you an expert on business

Why not though? It's essentially harmless
you've been living under a rock deep within a mountain range, it's massive.
life has always been about choosing the lesser evil; this is just another time where this seems the case.
If you think you will have fun, go ahead, as you said, they already have your money, nothing will change from now on.
No, the only logical choice is to burn it after you apready paid for it
I work in retail. These cards have zero monetary value until loaded at check out. This is to prevent loss from theft.
Well the less they sell, the less they have to restock.

I think OP is just trying to make a statement more than anything though.
Yeah but the way stores know what to buy more of is if the stuff they're selling actually sells. So although they've already bought this shipping of cards, if these ones don't sell then they won't buy anymore (because they realise it's not profitable), which hurts blizzard if even a tiny bit
You got me fam
I did a thing!!!
Yup. https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/29/eyeing-an-entry-into-china-roblox-enters-strategic-partnership-with-tencent/

China has ownership in everything
It sure is
No one is expecting Blizzard to stop anything by themselves...or really help end it...they could have done literally nothing and everyone would have been happy. By trying to defend China they've gained nothing but lost quite a bit. Had they just kept quiet and not made a fuss they could have continued to happily play both sides.
I'd still tell off a thief for stealing, even if it won't stop all thieves in the world.
>	it means Blizzard can’t do shit on their own without risking to to bankrupt since China is the biggest country there is and the gaming scene there is so huge that you’d be losing more money than what you earn.

Doesn't the SE Asia region account for around 12 percent of their revenue?

Didnt they make record profits last year and now even have less expenses due to laying off 800 people? 8 percent of their employees.

￼They would not go bankrupt from losing less than 10% of their revenue when making record profits and having cut down 8% of the most expensive part of business, employees.￼

They would make less money, which greed obviously finds unacceptable.￼
Let's not exaggerate here.

Their income from that region is less than 20% overall.
Not having China would *not* bankrupt them.

Loss of potential revenue, sure. Bankrupt? Not even close.

I'm sure legally anything and everything has some form of value, in this case the 0.2 cents the cardboard itself cost which would still count as theft of property and they're still losing potential income by not having that card to sell.
To answer your question, I'd say that yes, it is stealing.  
But would there be consequences? Maybe not.  

Keep in mind that, although they do not hold any value, they are still the store's property and taking anything from the store is stealing.  

Stealing is about taking without consent, not about value.  

I worked 9 years in a convenience store and we had to get the police involved because a son (mid 30) and his dad would always come in and steal sugar packets. Yes, those sugar packets right next to the coffee machine.  

They'd buy stuff and grab a handful of sugar packets, without the coffee, and my boss told them to stop, they didn't, so the police was involved.  

6 years later they're still banned from that store.  

I'd think that taking one card just for "the fun of it", wouldn't be an issue. But taking a whole bunch of cards? That might annoy an owner and make him want to enforce his right.
Wow what a hero, he really saved the people of Hong Kong! That’ll show those businessmen and their Chinese overlords! Keep on fighting the good fight my circlejerking friends!
Actually it is the same as nothing.
A person like you who's feelings are hurt and would love to make a company go under and 10's of thousands of people get laid off because in your heart its more right to punish all the developers and people who had NO part in this and are honest hard working people?  That is disgusting. You really should be ashamed at wanting people to lose their jobs for something one guy that makes up 0.0001% of their employees did. Please refrain from joining politics with your mindset.

Blizzard isn't a Chinese company. Not buying Blizzard products will not stop the Chinese Government from breaking peoples arms and running them over with tanks till they turn to mush.

Remember this as you read this reply from a product that was manufactured in China.
You know how much difference deleting your Blizzard account makes? Something between 0 and 0.
Honestly, the amount of time people have spend in games like wow or diablo, id never expect someone to delete their account for this cause. To much work wasted.
>I can't in good conscience give money to a company that supports a fascist 'communist' dictatorship over the basic human right to freedom of speech of their own loyal fanbase

Same
what a load of bullshit
I doubt you'll be seeing an apology, especially after their statement made friday, and the fact that blitz has pretty much made up with them. While i agree that initial punishment was extreme, they are a business, and are beholden to their shareholders interests.
Cries in 6 month prepay
[deleted]
They did technically apologize already and gave blitzchung his money back and halved his ban
stop paying the US government. they support Saudi Arabia, a religious nutjob of a country that kills gay people
Exactly that. Though if you can't afford that then don't delete it. Personally deleted and wrote a letter saying I'd happily buy the games again if they apologized and made clear they value freedom from oppression and freedom to criticize your government, but that anyone doing it on their tourney will be banned. That's all I want.
There are so many good games out there. I was like you, until I realized Blizzard has been dead for a decade now. They're inability to develop anything new has been a serious problem for a long time. The problems began with SC2 and D3. They've only gotten worse since then.

Try other games and you won't look back at Blizzard, trust me!
Well... technically they are not. You have revocable licenses to play those games.
We need to remember a lot of Blizzard employees are really upset about the way this was handled and side with fans.  It’s their livelihood and passion to make great games and they can’t just quit. 

However, the folks responsible for this will be at BlizzCon. It’s a fine line to walk but we should support the devs and question the leadership. 

It’s important to show Blizzard that their player base values freedom of speech, liberty, and transparency.

You know majority won’t even know what’s going on. I wouldn’t be surprised if most of the mobile downloads originated in China.
Couldn’t agree more.
Sucks you got downvoted but it's the truth. I'll still keep playing. I honestly think most of the people are just doing this to be part of the trend and in another week when this dies down, they'll be back to subbing to WoW or regret deleting their account. 

EVERYONE in my guild had the same exact reaction to the situation which was "get rekt HK lmao" or something to that effect.
Well paying for the games or giving them money. Is in a way saying you support their censorship. That's the entire point why people don't want to support the company.
As long as you brush your teeth after... all good :)
They baned me when I sayed damn 😡😡
I don't think anyone was banned because they expressed their political convictions in a Blizzard game according to the rules. He was not allowed to express any political belief at this event. No one gets banned ingame.
If you dont think that Blitzchung should have received any punishment at all then you are just oblivious to your own political bias.
Hey, it’s a question of raising awareness! Before this happen I personally have never heard anything about Tencent or Chinese investments in general. But this incident pushed me to do research, and now I can make more informed decisions! So I suggest we spread information instead of calling people names. More useful and more powerful than calling people fuckwits, I think.
Reductionist views don't help. There's a ton of factors and for you to pretend that you have any sort of grasp of what any given person is doing is arrogant at best. You don't know the extent people are going to, and it really doesn't matter because whether or not Redditors are proceeding *ideally* shouldn't be the main focus of a bunch of people coming together to do their best with the hand they're dealt to educate themselves and others about oppression. Like, you realize you're doing less, right? Being the dude who bitches and moans about people bitching and moaning isn't ideal either.
it's more hilarious that people are claiming that they "did their part" while doing nothing at all.
They'd have to boycott all of Epic since it's the biggest Tencent share and all the games made with UE4 (which is a shit ton these days).
Exactly my problem with all this drama.  
I just don't understand the hate against a single company who just wanted to keep their gaming community safe from politics and such stuff.
If this is how you react to non-offensive jokes I have some bad news for you.
Never.
Thanks. Where my trophy?
Play stupid games win stupid prizes, private companies dont need to give your a platform, huehuehue.
Very happily, 8.3 is looking great!
>People walk out with them all the time to keep as gifts to activate later because of this. And even this is rare.

So which is it? It can either happen all the time, or it can be rare, not both
open your mouth, I want to smell what brand of polish you bought.
Did you really just compare this video to that? Because not only are you completely ignorant for that, the cards aren't worth anything until purchased. So how exactly is it hurting their countrymen?
Oh boy, I get to spend 2 seconds moving a card over and wonder what weirdo would put the card back on the wrong peg. That really cuts down my 8 hour shift.
I, personally, am annoyed whenever I see product in the wrong place. How hard is it to put the paint brush back in the same box you grabbed it from?
Yea, perhaps someone could get a righty oh laughin' when they see what has been done.
And on the other end some companies don't actually care for legality if profits outweigh the punishment that'd follow when caught. Companies are really only as good as the people leading them.
Exactly, a company may make the morally wrong choice for profit, but it's entirely within the consumers rights to not buy from a company they deem unethical.

I can buy fairtrade food because I want to support workers in developing countries. I can boycott nestle (or try to) because of their unethical water hoarding practices. Yes its a business working for profit doing the most profitable business decision. No I don't want to support it.

Boycotting Blizzard is just the same thing. Are they within their legal rights to do what they did? Yes. Do I want to support them now? No.
> It's really strange how corporations have somehow managed to trick us into defending their horrible actions.

I agree, I hate the "a company is obligated to make as much profit as possible so their actions are justified" fanboy argument.

Obviously companies have to be competitive in a capitalist market and profit is a measure of that success, but that doesn't mean  that they are validated in ignoring moral and ethical standards to do so just because they are inside the law. The whole justification for a free-market in general is that it is for the welfare of a whole society, but the system can only work in a society that isn't chaotic and corrupt. The law isn't the end-all be-all when it comes to ethical boundaries, because the law will never be able to address every aspect of business and also has a hard time catching up to this fast changing world. There are gray areas where a company needs to self-regulate themselves to determine what's right and in Blizzard's case, they made a choice that I can't support and will say goodbye to SC2 as a result.
How is choosing the cheeper legal option greedy? Is it greedy every time I buy food I choose the store brand? Is it greedy if I the company I work for buys bags from a company who sells them for 35 cents each as opposed to 40 from a different company? Business is about making money. Making money means you save cost in other areasm if it's legal who are you to call it "greedy"?
For all you know saving money in one spot allows them to pay higher wages.
Trust me they will choose China.  People act like its even in question if it comes down to it...
Oh noo, what are they gonna do?
The virtue signallers will be back in a week.
This guy uses the real common sense.
Guess who had to sign all the paperwork to let the activision merger happen?  Blizz lawyers/employees.    If it wasn't activision it would have been someone else.  People don't just merge companies for shits and giggles.  They were looking for this.
I doubt it will become a trend. I am just amazed on how naive someone can be to believe that a trend on the internet will remain harmless and won't be exaggerated into extremes.
I was trying to be more informative than judgemental. The issues on Roblox aren't getting nearly as much press.
They still got my money though, that's the problem here.
Yup, I had an issue come up where some cards were on display that had the wrong ESRB rating. I told my manager, he said to literally just shred them and they'd order new ones. They have no value at all just sitting on a peg, it's just printed cardboard.
So just don't buy them 4Head
China owns this comment.
I just picked whatever card was next to it apologize for not researching before performing slactivist things
So might as well not even try then, Right?
But they weren't defending China. They were just trying to keep politics out no?



This seems to be the largest misconception about this situation. People in their heads have already decided that blizzard was doing the bidding of the Chinese government, but really it had nothing to do with the Hong Kong situation.
They could have done nothing and they ghosted the dude.  Might be dramatic but from what I hear it's in the wheelhouse.
But this situation is nothing like that. Blizzard gets more money like this, and they couldn't save Honk Kong anyways.
Dont you have a phone?
The Asia-Pacific region accounts for 10% of Activision Blizzard revenue. So not only China.

It's around ~1/3rd of Blizzard revenue.
How would you feel if you lost 20% of your income?
Almost all of their investment and development costs for new products are targeted at this market. 

If you think the loss of that future revenue plus the loss of years of development costs with virtually no return would be a serious problem that’s pretty ignorant. 

That said, at some point principles need to outweigh profits and if not happy with how Blizz has handled this.
A game engine. Started off as an indie game and slowly mutated into whatever it is today.
I expect the best and I give the best 😎
Buddy. You are missing the point. The card literally says that IT HAS NO VALUE. Sure, there is a law with garbage. But what about gift cards.

Plus, no shit you can’t go into someone’s house and take things. That is breaking and entering.
Ok. But it says it has no value. Not that it’s worth 0.2 cents.
Thank you! I love this intelligent, thought out response.
Don't worry, the "easily triggered" phase will fade as you get older and more experienced, so you can look forward to that.  Until then, keep on trolling :P
you see friend, 0.00000001 > 0

You can't change the maths
Keep lying to yourself.
At the end of the day its just a game, i played wow sincd beta. And am a huge SC fan.

All gone, other games to play.
I wouldn't expect anyone to do it but some feel it's important enough. Sometimes it's good to recognize a fruitless cause. I'd love to be proven wrong, but I don't ever see Blizzard(Activision) coming back with enough of an apology and correction of direction to outweigh the way they played their cards here.
I have over 10,000 hours of /played time in WoW. I have put many hours into Hearthstone, HoTS, Overwatch, D3, and Starcraft 64. I have been playing Blizzard games for longer than my memory can go back.

This whole event has been so heartbreaking, and I just have not been able to pull any plugs yet, but I feel bad every time I log in...
[deleted]
It's wasted anyways.
It speaks volumes about the community. I think it is amazing.
It’s just a game. Feeling like you wasted your time and/or money? No, you get to keep the memories of fun times and move on to other games that deserve your hard earned cash.
You know there's some good in you if you had too much time invested in WoW and still went through deleting everything because freedoms more important.

I know I scrubbed Overwatch off my Xbox. I don't own a PC anymore but I'ma delete my battle account through my phone real soon though.
Also same.
Stomping on free speech and supporting human-rights violations and they've "already paid for it"? Guess that stuff is cheaper than I thought.
That’s completely not the issue. When a Chinese company does Chinese things in their country, that’s on China. It’s a shitty country to live in, from an American perspective. They don’t like how we do things and we don’t like how they do things. But as participants in the global community, we make agreements for trade between different countries (states). 

However, in this case, we had an American company participate in un-American use of power to set an example against freedom of speech when a different country with huge market leverage flexed their muscles. The American company (Blizzard) aided and abetted the foreign repression of free speech and attempted to silence a call for human rights. 

That’s the issue.
The employees won't be hurt by this. Blizzard Activision fired 800 employees on a record year for profits. They won't have less work because of this bashlack.
Lol if you honestly think what Blizzard did was just a "stupid mistake". There was no mistake about it.

And using your logic, I dont want the Apple employees who value human rights to be hurt...so I wont stop buying Apple shit.

No idea what the point of your post is.
The Apple factories are the best employment opportunities in the area by a mile. The workers would be the ones most fucked if those factories for whatever reason went out of business.

Basically, you want to further opress those being oppressed.
That wasn't an apology, that was a shoddy attempt at damage control.
I agree with you. Blitzchung even said what he did was wrong. My only problem is with the casters.
They did not apologize. They said that blitzchung getting 6 months is more appropriate implying that the full year is still suitable but 6 months is just MORE appropriate
I'm a little scared for you if you don't understand the difference between paying taxes to the government of the country you live in and giving money to an entirely optional video game company.
If you delete your account you forfeit the games on that account. If you have the physical CD you might be able to play it still, but digital purchases are gone.
At some point there is going to be a court ruling that changes that and it will have retroactive consequences.

As Gen-X and millennials age they will be taking control of governments and the fact that tech companies think that they can sell you a product then revoke your right to use it at any time essentially at their discretion is not something that will be tolerated forever.
> OP's mom had 7.7 Billion monthly active users. 

&#x200B;

Armchair calculations say... three different guys(?) a second. Seems a little on the low side for a "your mom" joke, but we'll take it.
No it doesn’t. I pay a wow sub to play wow.
Paying them money for playing a game you like doesn’t automatically means that you are supporting any business decisions they do. Same as buying stuff made in China doesn’t mean you support their political regime now, does it?
they banede me for saysiyngh frick
Naming your character after a political figure will get you a forced namechange. Doing it repeatedly will get you banned. It's in the EULA.
> He was not allowed to express any political belief at this event.

That was not in the rules.
Yeah, Hong Kong is just as bad as China guys.  ^^/s
> it's more hilarious that people are claiming that they "did their part" while doing nothing at all.

Its absolute cringe, its nothing but a sham for fake internet points.
>keep their gaming community safe from politics and such stuff.

Have you seen Barrens chat or trade chat in wow? Its nothing but politics.
I'm not sure you're using the word "safe" correctly lol
It was revoked because you expressed political views. We'll give it back if Reddit gets angry enough at us though.
Both. People will take them as keepsakes or to activate later more often than you'd think. 

But it doesn't happen all that often either.

Also depends on the store. Sometimes those card stands stay untouched by anyone for weeks and collect dust.

When overwatch launched, there were people who went and grabbed the PS4 cards from the kiosk because they wanted them as keepsakes but they were playing on PC and PC was digital goods.
1. The staff who has to inventory the card
2. The average customer who wants to buy wow time

Just because OP doesn't like Blizzard, he's gonna sabotage other players from playing Blizzard games? What a hero!
As a customer, I find that cards on the wrong peg happens all the time regardless of any political intention. Many customers just don't bother putting an item back on the right spot.
Then we don't choose Blizzard.
It's a little more complicated than that. To go from small wallet to big budget you need capital. The conventional way of that is outside capital. So you bit by bit give up control. Stock market, external pressure and they go to mergers and end where they are now slowly rotting away the original vision.
Of course it will! 
https://youtu.be/GPnTv0_WoEk
So get a refund and quit bitching

Surely your refund alone will bankrupt blizzard
they do own reddit so technically yes.
That's definitely the PR response, I guess it's up to you weather or not to believe it. What is certain is that similar violations have not received anywhere near as harsh a penalty as this particular topic...we each have to draw our own conclusion on that front.
They literally made a statement to China about how angered they were by the situation and how they would uphold the pride and dignity of the country. Of course they're sucking China's big Willy.
> They were just trying to keep politics out no?

if that's all they wanted to do then a 1/3 strike probation kind of thing would've been fine. 

but they fired 2 casters and took the guy's prize money, and banned him for like a year.

their PR response 5 days later or whatever was continuing to pretend what they did was right with no apology.

and as other posts here have shown, they are happy to mix politics all up in there in the USA (e.g. LGBTQ) but not in China (e.g. LGBTQ).
How is it nothing like that?
That's not the same argument being made.

The post was insinuating that losing part of that region would bankrupt the company. It wouldn't. Not even close.

Losing the revenue would hurt, sure - but not force them into bankruptcy.
I'm not missing the point. No value and free/take me are two different things. 

The cards have no value until they are taken to the register for theft reasons. It's to deter people from stealing.
I think you're missing the point, the card as a whole has no value as-is but there  are manufacturing costs involved...the ink to print the images...the materials themselves like cardboard...none of that is free. It might have no value to the consumer, until activated, but someone somewhere paid money to have it made and shipped...even if it was a minuscule sum. Theft is theft regardless of value or worth.
Thanks man for the kind words
Talking about yourself huh? It's good to be self aware I guess.
Yeah cause uninstalling a Blizzard game leads to saving Chinese people from getting their rights re-instated and not having their arms broken at the elbow.  
But keep buying PC parts and stuff that are manufactured in China by some of the corporations that support the people leading the killings.
I'm sure china LOVES all the nice little water coolers and awesome graphics cards you buy that include parts made in their wonderful factories :)
Where’s the lie? The developers even staged walk outs at the corporate office, but you want to insinuate that the entire company needs to be punished?
You deleted your shit? Then again, WoW is rather dead at this point (imo). Its just a matter of time when classic runs out of content or nostalgic value.
Lol do you want to list some of the games are going to go play so I can go ahead and Link you how they have ties to communist China or would you ignore that and just keep your selective outrage focused on blizzard? What about the food you eat or the clothes you wear are the phone you use for the computer you use as a car you drive you don't think any of those businesses do business with communist China? well I guess it doesn't matter because it's called selective outrage for a reason and you can just select what you're outraged at so never mind proceed with the hypocrisy.
I can't see how an apology will ever be enough. An apology is easy to make and literally means nothing, it's just words. Sure an apology between two individuals is one thing, but a big corporation, nah man.

Blizzard better show me with actions that they're "sorry". They need to step up truly and live by their own words; "Every voice matters".
I'm more worried about the fact if I keep my account open with them, in the future what further information will they want from me and end up passing directly or indirectly to an authoritarian government? They've already declined my requests for data and account deletion three times and I just put in my fourth and final before I start contacting government officials and media. Blizzard has obliterated any and all goodwill they built up with me, and I've been a fan of their properties since I was a kid playing The Lost Vikings on SNES. Like you said, they've played their cards and the direction Bobby Kotick and crew wish to take Activision Blizzard isn't a direction I support.
I know how they could come back and restore their image in my eyes. If theyd release a Diablo4 without any ingame purchases. Like none. No greedy bs. Just a good, polished, blizzard north quality game with a fair price. Simple as that. That would go a looong way. Giving me some faith back.

Someone commented having over 10k hours in wow and having played most other blizz titles too and im also in the thousands range for D3 for sure. I think even if Blizzard never comes back from this, i wouldnt delete my account. Too much work went into this. Its totaly fine just not touching the games. There is no harm in keeping this stuff until Blizz goes titts up and maybe releases an offline version for D3.
I've been trying to play games like SC2, and HOTS, but every time i have been, I feel dirty, especially when i look at the Brood War skin i wanted, and now can't have because I was going to buy it the day the news broke about the injustice. I am both PISSED and disgusted because not only are they supporting a polical entity that refuses to accept freedom, they are also providing me with a giant WALL in the way of something i would have broke down and wasted money on. The people responsible should be thrown on the street and left in a gutter.
> Starcraft 64

Wait what? I thought everyone hated that version of the game.
I would highly recommend that people who think along the lines of "I've already put so much work/time/money into _____" read up on the concept of [Escalation of Cost](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment) (often related to the Sunk Cost Fallacy).

Essentially, just because you invested in the past, doesn't mean that you've actually wasted that investment by choosing to no longer sink more into it.

EDIT: Typo, thanks phone. (Sink Cost Fallacy -> Sunk Cost Fallacy)
That's why I ended up deleting and switching to a bunch of other games to see what clicks.  If I'm not going to support Blizzard financially then I'm not going to undo that moral stance by populating their servers and, essentially, help make their games playable.  I was Server First to 85 and have other unique, irreplaceable achievements (I'm sure many of us do), so I haven't been strong enough to delete the account, but I deleted it off my computer so it would take an extra amount of weakness and lying to myself to get it going again.

I also couldn't stomach pretending to be a hero online while boosting the server population numbers of a company actively trying to suppress a guy who spoke up for real life heroes.  It was nauseating and really changed the way I looked at myself.
Get out of that computer chair and your balls might finally drop, and instead of feeling sad you will feel glad leaving blizzard in the dust.
Blizzard wants that china money more than they care about human decency. They did not even reverse the ban. Just 1/2 it. If this was there worst moment, why didn't they actually apologize? Because that would get in the way of that sweet sweet chinese money. Is a video game worth your damn soul?
lol, blizzard isn't a people, it's a company. I throw money at them when they do nice things, I burn their shit to the ground when they back organ-harvesting freedom-oppressing tyrants. if you don't, then they keep propping up things like organ harvesting and freedom oppressing, *because it's not a goddamn person with a conscience with whom I have any manner of social contract*.
I would say it’s the complete opposite of stupid to escape a time consuming MMO made by a company that only cares about profits.  Even in a normal situation, the amount of work in a MMO has no payoff, there’s no skills acquired to help you better your lot in life.  I’d suggest it to anyone that’s put so much progress in a game that they feel they can’t quit, even if the company that makes it is proving themselves to be evil.
Companies should be involved in politics, they always are. Silence is a decision. 

You sound like a coward and an apologist. 

Sit on the sideline and oaky the games you love. Make no personal sacrifice. The world goes on despite people like you. 

Apathy is a cancer.
Time spent happy is never wasted.
Yea nah, id much rather have something to show for than just having the time effort and money go up in flames.
They did apologise to China.
That’s why I said technically
Everyone demands an apology then when they get one they won't accept it. What kind of apology we're people seriously expecting to get from a major corporation?
The casters who encouraged Blitzhchung to hijack the tournament stream, instead of trying to keep the discussion on topic? Why would you want someone like that casting another esports tournament?
[deleted]
Exactly my deal. I "boycotted" wow for 10 years before this shit happened and I only started playing again for classic. I'm not the one who funded them to this point and I'm not going to quit now. Everyone who canceled their subs will be buying Chinese products in the future no matter how hard they try not to.
I wonder if any of these nerds ever took a look at their clothing tags.  XD
It doesn't mean your supporting it. But your definately financing it. Which in my definition is supporting it. Kinda like when advertiser's pull out when they find someone has done something bad they are partnering with. Now company's do this just to save face. But as a person I believe in the same concept but for more humanistic reasons.

Obviously no, i wholly support hong kong. But that is still a political bias. If blitzchung is allowed to do express his beliefs then suddenly blizzard has to let everyone, and its only so long before someone is expressing hateful beliefs you dont agree with
A mild inconvenience is not hurting someone. What a grossly entitled statement. The employee still gets paid, the customer still gets their card. Heaven forbid you do something that takes more than 3 seconds.
[deleted]
Yep and throw out any other chinese products you own while you are at it.
Seems pretty simple to me.  They sold out. That was their decision.  Doesnt matter to whom it was.  The end result is the same.
Rn I'm honestly too high to give a shit, so. . .
How so?
There hasnt been any other situation in GRANDMASTERS.

The American University situation, is because they arwnt under the same contract that Blitzchung was under. 

I dont watch GM but I have heard of people being punished for doing much less so I’ll assume Blizzard doesnt like rule breaking very much. 

The punishment was harsh and considering the whole situation happened outside the USA, I am sure the overexaggeration was a poor attempt to be diplomatic.
Unpopular opinion....REEEEEEEE
that was people working for netease which is chinese company on china  

guesss what the people working there are chinesse !
No they didn't.
Yeah Blizzard dropped a PR ball the size of a city
What about LGBT? So they have a gay character in a game... That means it has to be in political support of LGBT? Sorry but that's just silly.
They already backed off, reduced the ban to 6 months and said he will keep his prize money.
Okay, it's like that but in a waaaay bigger scale with different options. Soo a little bit like that.
That’s true. But people like to exaggerate.
Exactly. No value. You just proved me right. So if I take it and it has no value at all, what is the criminal charge? Stealing. Ok. What is the value of what I stole if it says it has no value printed right on it.
I am missing the point? I am asking on a law perspective. Not how much the cards cost to make. Not the materials. So thanks. But no. I want an answer from someone who knows something about the law.
Just giving you some hope for the future is all XD
In a sense, yes.  As it fades, you learn what's important to you, and what's not.  The most important thing for myself being that I do the best I can to leave the world slightly better at the end of the day.  Whether that's holding a door for someone, helping the old lady next door with her groceries, or leaving little tidbits of knowledge on the internet.

You seem like a smart kid but I think you're "wasting your time" on a lot of the posts you make.  It's your time to waste, don't get me wrong, but I think you could do so much more if you were to determine what you feel is important to you and refocus your efforts on those things (instead of the unintelligible bullshit so commonly found on the internet.)

Also, self-awareness is heavily undervalued.
so do nothing, is better.
yeah, I mean, 10 years of vanilla private server growth definitely proves that people get bored
Whataboutism  aint helping anyone m8.
Something is better than nothing, even if you wish it was more.

This is more about a message. Even shutting blizzard down entirely wouldn't do a whole lot besides shut down blizzard. But if they go down or take a significant hit, other companies might be less likely to follow suit. Even if they're unphased, at least people can see that they aren't alone, because it's hard to try if you think nobody else cares and it's you against the world.
That's what I mean by "apology AND correction of direction." There's no reason to be against each other here.
In this case it would mean something because China is watching. Blizzard put out that bootlicking post on Chinese social media because they knew that. If they publicly say they were wrong to silence support for HK then they're putting themselves at risk of being banned from the country. That's what I want to see.
This is how I felt after their "apology". I won't delete anything, but they wont be getting any more money from me until I feel they represent the company I grew up with again and that likely wont happen, so it is what it is. The only blizzard getting my attention going forward is at the local Dairy Queen.
Don't hold your breath.
They gotta give us a “free Hong Kong” emote for free in games that support emotes such as overwatch before I forgive
Inb4 Diablo 4 + all dlcs free at Blizzcon
This whole situation would not be relevant to Blizzard if not for “just words.”
It was my first blizzard game, lets be honest, it sucks, and I didn't play the campaign way back then when I started playing it. I booted up the ol' N64 a few years ago to try it again, and rose tinted glasses were brutally shattered, the game *sucks*, the N64 controls ***suck***. But it was still worth bringing up, as I have had a lot of fun on it in the past, and i'll always have those memories! If this whole situation wasn't happening, maybe i'd try Starcraft Remastered, or Starcraft 2

EDIT: Also a fun thing to mention, when I tried it again a few years back, I gave it a serious try; I looked up the control mappings, and I went ham. I could not beat the zerg campaign, I tried so many times, and the sweat of my hands made the controller joystick so frustrating to work with. Man now i'm looking at that with a bit of nostalgia, funny how that works
I've typed and deleted this reply so many times now, trying to figure out how to even respond. I don't know. I am refusing to myself that this is a sunk cost situation, because I ditch projects that i've poured tons of hours into all the time. But maybe it is, maybe it's only different because of the *amount* of time, my entire remembered life has been spent on this game. Quitting isn't easy, even if I have a good reason to. I know that sounds like addiction, and if this was just a few months ago i'd agree, but lately i've managed to tone this down to a proper hobby and I haven't logged in every single day, but maybe i'm just throwing excuses.

BFA would be the perfect time for me to finally leave after all these years, but now there's Classic. I've been waiting for this for so long, I don't want to miss it. I know it's still a long time away, but after Kel'thuzad, I need to seriously re-evaluate my life
[deleted]
People out here thinking giving up a video game is a life changing sacrifice  XD
I can only speak for myself but not all the time spent in wow was spent happy in hindsight.
Sunken cost fallacy eh? It was bound that some fanboys wouldn’t be able to cut their addiction.
As someone who has been actively engaged in several esports events, I can tell you that 6 month bans is a career ender for most people. Even 2 - 3 months is enough shade to kill a commentators career. I personally don't think Blitzchung will re-enter the Heartstone scene, it's going to be  a very difficult road ahead for him. $10,000 is small recompense for the long term loss he has ahead of him.

Thanks for your comment though. You are right to acknowledge *some* form of action/communication from Blizzard, even if it technically was akin to an oily fish wriggling out of an uncomfortable situation. Playing the middle ground isn't going to appease the fans.

My take on it is this - they would have done well to reverse the bans for all three people, Blitz+casters, and refund the prize money with a hefty, and I mean *hefty*, warning for any future incidents being met with the 12 month ban hammer. It would be enough to say "we're sorry" but also say " we really take events seriously and do not want to turn esports into a political forum"
One that actually apologizes and doesn’t attempt to hide, obfuscate, or otherwise ignore the other major key points of the whole situation. 

What Blizz put out wasn’t an apology.
I didnt know that. I don’t speak Chinese.
Until you realize PC's don't come with optical drives anymore.   


Plus the CD keys are probably invalid now.
While this very much applies to someone who's main concern is clothing and spends a lot of money there. I get the bare necessities when it comes to clothes. And I unfortumatley have to be picky about the price. 

You are right though with the use of online tools like Amazon it's much easier to purchase and research better options for those with the resources to do so. I hope I do I make the correct decision
I support Blizzard with my money to create more games I like to play. What they do with the rest is not my concern. When you pay taxes do you support your government spending it for unnecessary wars?
None of this bans expressing political beliefs. Thanks for confirming.

ETA: And these aren't even the Hearthstone rules. What does Overwatch tournament rules have to do with any of this?
They're currently supporting beliefs we don't agree with.
Yet they can push social justice in their games at times? That is not political bias? Rolls eyes.
In that case, OP has done nothing at all besides karma whore. I hate what China has done to HK as much as the next guy, but this is just pathetic
Screwing over the staff in the shop or wow players isn't "doing something good", it's called picking an easy target
"whatabout-ism" in full effect here 😂

Yeah I know other companies support China and its nearly impossible to avoid it.

But I don't like how Blizzard is conducting business. So I will not support them. Easy as that :)
Calm down Mr iPhone user. We know you can't live without your Chinese made products.
Yep well it's been terminal for a long time. Well before this latest PR disaster.
Wow bro ur so cool
They have a 5% stake in reddit, or something close to that number.
Unpopular? Maybe. Stupid? Very much so.
They still speak for Blizzard.
Yes they did, I guess you live under a rock.
What about LGBT?

Blizzard says "our official broadcasts remain focused on the game and are not a platform for divisive social or political view".

https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dgodfz/we_wont_allow_any_talk_of_social_justice_or/

>  So they have a gay character in a game

apparently, not in china.

> [If you weren't aware, in China for instance all the LGBTQ stuff is scrubbed. Tracer and Soldier 76 for instance are completely straight, in China. Multiple people have confirmed this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dgodfz/we_wont_allow_any_talk_of_social_justice_or/f3e4v3a/?context=3)
That's a start. They still haven't unfired the casters. And 6-month ban is still overkill for a first strike offense.

The casters are still fired and he was still punished for supporting human rights.
They haven't backed off, they want people to think they did, but not a damn thing changed ethically
Making the card costs money. So it does have a value
On a law perspective, the cards have value to the supplier. Even if they didn't, value is irrelevant so taking them without compensation constitutes theft either way. I don't really see how this is hard to understand. 

TL:DR Just don't steal shit and you won't have to worry about it.
Yea, if it was one continuous server i might believe that. But it wasnt.
Pointing out we are all Hypocrites and want to keep our heads in the sand is not helping m8.

FIFY
Sure and I bet you also wipe your ass before you poop?
My bad for missing the "and" in your comment.
I fully understand where you're coming from, and it's one of the reasons why I think it's important to understand the concept(s) I mentioned in the above comment. While I support the boycott (for me, it was ditching HS), I really just added that comment because it's easy to lose perspective with something like an MMO.

At the end of the day, WoW is just a game with the social aspect of an MMO culture. Fundamentally, that means that you should be able to stop and start whenever you want without it truly harming your day to day life. It sounds like you've maybe had some issues with that in the past, but are working your way out of it - Personally I dealt with that a bit with Final Fantasy XI, so all I can say is good job and do what's best for you.
cares about profits vs *only* cares about profits. both survive, but the latter doesn't even blink when some of those profits have a little mass murder and systemic oppression sprinkled on them.
Doesn't have to be life changing to be hard, but of you can't give up a game for your morals. What could you ever give up? No one is asking people to be a saint.
you are comparing apples and oranges.
Frankly I'd say even pay the casters for lost wages, and make a point to get them a new job as casters elsewhere.
Just wondering, they can't just make another account and play?
You Sir are getting a upvote for properly using the the word obfuscate! Such a great word.
Nobody should have expected any more of an apology than what we got. Everyone is upset about Blitz losing his prize money and being banned for a year, as well as the announcers, and Blizz game him his prize moeny back and cut his ban in half. That's the best possible scenario we could have realistically expected.
Ya I usually try to hide my face when I'm following the rules.  Totally normal...
Cheapest external USB DVD drives are like $20.

CD keys would still work for offline play, when installing a game the key is only checked against an algorithm in the installer program which makes sure the key has been created with that same algorithm and is not just some random keystrokes.

In online play the key is again authenticated when the game calls home through Internet.
The keys aren't invalid, that's a load of crap. You can type the key from your case into your Bnet account and add the game to your digital collection or install it straight from the CD.
If money is the issue buy all your clothes second hand.  No money makes it overseas.  End of problem.
If you read the highlighted portions there’s a lot of stuff that’s determined by Tournament Administration.  

There’s also the fact that Blizzards response says they wants their events to be focused on the games themselves.  

I image that Hearthstone would have similar rules about player conduct. All it would take is a 10 second google search for you to find out.
It is not just beliefs though, its also about fairness and equal opportunity.
Isn't that the point of Reddit? Also it made me laugh so there's that too.
Hey there.  I worked in two tech stores for about 12 years between the two. (Circuit City and a mom and pop). The vendors that stocked the card racks only did so when they were low and they did so many of those card stands, that all it took was about 30 seconds. They would immediately notice if cards were switched around because most of them are plan-o-grammed the same. So you are really making a mountain from a mole hill as this would take mere moments to fix and the vendor would likely not even care.
[deleted]
Slacktivism in full effect here.  Again, I'm sure blizz is the only company you support that has or is conducting bad business.  But you just need to wait for reddit to tell you to be enraged.
I use my pc.  That I built.
Exactly.  The tactics in the online store.  The continued disregard for their core playerbase on all franchises they run basically.  The big wigs of blizz aren't running for the hills for fun.
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Oh, so they don't own reddit, just 1/20th of reddit.  Looks like the actual majority owner is Advance Publications, a privately held company.
Go ahead and link it buddy. It sounds like you read something and made up your own alternative meaning to it.
Yeah because if they want to sell their product there they have to? They the same thing with wow and even the wow movie.



I'm not sure what your point is though? There are similar (changes to games) things done in many countries. China just happens to a bit more than most and a good sized market. Does having a gay character mean they are being political?
It’s on the contract he signed so it is nothing out of the rules.
Your comment was good at explaining it. Up until the disrespectful tort at the end.

Welcome to reddit.
I'm not sure what you're getting at. I think what I said makes more sense.
Thanks man, this sort of stuff can be difficult to talk about sometimes, especially with how people can be on Reddit. WoW won't last forever, it sure has lasted longer than most people thought it would, i'll be ready when the train finally hits its last destination
I mean,  theoretically he could but there would be no reason to. He makes money from the competitions which he is now unable to participate in.
You need to realistically reevaluate your expectations and integrity then my man.
everyone \[articles, reddit\] said they were trying to hide or something. idk
That may have worked before [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) launcher was a thing, but as soon as you go to patch your game / make an account on [battle.net](https://battle.net) it's going to pop as used CD KEY as all blizzard games require use through battle net.   


You may be able to get away with warcraft 3 / D2 / SC2 in the original format, but no online play. 

My suggestion would be to find a WOW private server and play for free if you like it that much .
Can you transfer the keys or reuse keys previously used?

WTF was the downvote for?
Your right thank you. I'll keep that in mind
But if the clothes are made in China and you buy them second hand, you are supporting person who is supporting China.
And it would take you a 10 second google search to find out that the Hearthstone rules (like the Overwatch rules you've posted) do not ban  political speech. 

It does penalize any speech that Blizzard deems offensive or they believe will cost them money - ***at their discretion***. That's why people are upset. Significantly fewer people would be upset if there was a blanket ban on all political speech.
My concern is that Blizzard's actions have silence someone's speech - seemingly in preference to another set of ideas, which is Hong Kong's protest I'd an insurgency and is unjust.

If Blizzard had just said that "opinions stated during the stream are not necessarily those of Blizzard" everything would have been fine. Instead they are giving Chinese nationalists the power to silence a non-citizen outside of their country. In what world does that make sense?
Fine. Does this not prevent a wow player from finding his game time in the shop?
Right. And it still prevents a wow gamer from buying the game time
Slacktivism is just essentially mentally supporting something. It's not slacktivism to boycott something. That's an actual financial incentive for a company to change. You can argue it's ineffective, but boycotting is taking a tangible stand.
[deleted]
From parts that were made in good old China
What does that have to do with you owning an iPhone?
Ya no shareholder that started with 5% ever ended up with majority control,  just doesnt happen.   /s
https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/dfi5rh/blizzards_official_response_we_highly_object_the/
It shows that Blizzard doesn't care about LGBT people because they don't wanna stick to their guns and would rather scrub them from a game so they can profit from China, instead of keeping them in and not taking money from an autocratic regime that pisses on human rights.
The reality of it is that every single decision Blizz makes is going to be in the name of money. It's unfortunate but that's the way big businesses work. This apology is a calculated move to not piss off the chinese market while trying to save face and reduce the damage done in the west. Blizz has no tegridy and I'm not going to fool myself into hoping they found it because everyone on reddit is mad at them.
They told him in mandarin. "SAY THE EIGHT WORDS"   They egged him on.   They knew it was against the terms of the contract they signed as employees.  I dont know where everyone in this thread is from but here, you can be fired for no reason whatsoever.  So actually violating a contract would easily get you canned.  But yes this only happens in china.  Yes china sucks ass.  But people need to actually use their heads.  China has been a shithole for years and we have been buying their products almost since the dawn of this nation.  Stop waiting for reddit to tell.you to be mad and think for yourself.
Yes. As long as there aren't 2 computers using the same key at the same time.
I'm not trying at all to defend what blizz has been doing lately and not even the recent debacle. They have been milking us for years and shit on us any chance they get for money.  No need to wait for reddit or any other site to tell you to be outraged.  We should have been voting with our dollars long before this.
That's not how that works.  When you buy from goodwill ect the money doesnt go to the person you knob.
Has there EVER been ANY other political speech at a Blizzard event? Either BlizCon, an eSports thing, any official stream of any kind. Has anyone else ever spoken about their own personal beliefs while broadcasting at or through something Blizzard official?
If your issue is silencing them then it should be about hong kong as a whole right now.
I agree.
All the cards are logged into the POS inventory system. If we couldn't find it on the rack we can check the computer and see how many we are supposed to have.  Finding errant cards is no big deal. The real pain in the ass was morons who would steal the cards not realizing they were unuseable.
Mentally supporting something does dick except make you feel better about yourself.  I stopped buying blizz products because I didnt like their tactics over the past couple of years.  The exclusive mounts that somehow ended up on the store after six months. I know it sucks but the ToS that blitzchung agreed to.  He chose to violate them.  As did the casters. End of story.  My point is I made that choice to leave myself.  I didnt wait for a social media outlets outrage to tell me that the blizz that we know died a long time ago and doesnt give a rat's ass about it's OG Fanbase.  Not to make a joke but try to be "Ahead of the curve"
Do you really want me to post my specs?  I will but I guaranfuckingtee.  None of it is chinese.  Like I said I do my research before Twitter or reddit tells me to.  Also samsung even tho I dont own their products have a manufacturer in Austin Texas.  You always have options if you look.
Nope.
I dont own one.  So I guess that's the joke?
Apple removed a map from their app store after pressure from the ccp because it was being used by protestors in HK.
Holy non-sequiter, Batman. 

We're talking about present day, not a hypothetical future. Move along.
So.. did you look at that thread? Because that comment wasn't made by Blizzard.
So basically what you're saying is  "nothing blizzard does now will be good enough."
what are you talking about dude. A: then good, glad they got fired. B: ive been those most "support blizzard in this decision" on reddit.
So you can register the same key on multiple accounts as long as only one is logged in at a time?
What do you mean blizzard milks for money? Overwatch has no season passes. Wow is the same way it’s been since it launched in terms of expansions etc. Starcraft 2 had one expansion, everything else free. Diablo 3 is the same way. And hots is just a generic moba. The only “milking” you get is through destiny or call of duty
I know, I was just pointing out that this idea of suporting somebody’s side actions when buying main product is stupid.
Not sure how that is relevant. You're welcome to watch all previous Blizzard streams to find out.
Big man here did it first!
[deleted]
Manufactured in TX from imported parts.  No different.
You do realize just because a product is assembled in the US doesn't mean the components come from the US, right?
Sure, You do have companies that are slowly moving to lower wage countries like Vietnam or Indonesia. But still the majority of computer parts are made in China, even if you think you have a product that isn't made there, it still might use outsourcing to manufacture some parts of it in a Chinese factory. Can you really tell me honestly that you know the origin of EVERY single piece that your computer has? Because I sure as hell can not, just because something says MADE IN X COUNTRY on the box, it rarely tells you anything but where it was assembled.
Ya thinking about the future and contemplating what could happen is for idiots just live in the present you are right.
It's a part of Blizzard. They represent the company for the Chinese market and everything they do is endorsed by Blizzard or else it wouldn't be done. 

It must suck to be so ignorant and willing to defend Blizzard.
Nothing they ever realistically could have done would have been good enough
I didnt mean this as a direct attack, I meant reddit as a whole.  Sorry I am replying to a lot of threads and got a little discombobulated.
...No, that would be stupid. That's like expecting to get your whole family into the theatre with 1 movie ticket, you can sell or transfer the ticket but you can only use it for it's value of 1 license.
You have no idea what you are talking about.  Literary almost everything in this paragraph is incorrect.  Starcraft expansions didnt go free to play until way after they were released.  Originally we paid for each one.  Overwatch has loot crates which people hate across the board in most video games nowadays.  Wow is 15 dollars a month and has a mount/pet store where they tell you things are exclusive yet months down the road are made available to everyone. Diablo 3 also you are incorrect there... Do I need to go on?
How can you not see that’s its relevant?  

If this is the first time then it sucks they all got banned, but it’s well within Blizzards authority to do so.  

If it HAS happened before then either Blizzard did the same thing and no one cared about it, or Blizzard did nothing.  

So tell again me how it’s not relevant.
That wasn't really the point.  It's not about being first or right.  It is about everyone being more tuned in to what is going on in our world and not just our country and not just paying attention to social media trends.  But thanks for joining the conversation.  Even if you didnt really add anything useful.
Enhance
If you look up I dont even own a samsung.  So this isn't even relevant.
Damn I the thought never crossed my mind.  Same prob goes for many things....  Yes of course It crossed my mind you doughnut.  I research my parts and components.  The same way I do musical instruments or cars that I buy.  More big brain shit from the peanut gallery.
That's fine. Not what this comment chain is about. You can start a new one. Hell, a whole new post, if you want. Be the change.
Its not a part of Blizzard at all. Its a totally different company.



>It must suck to be so ignorant and willing to defend Blizzard.



Says the guy who just made a completely false claim.
So....."we're mad and we're just gonna stay mad forever."
I am not stupid. I am just not sure how people are claiming that deleting your account won’t result in losing licenses even if you still have the previously used CD keys.

It is clear having the CD keys is not going to help you get your licenses back if you return to the game after deleting your account.

I AM JUST ASKING QUESTIONS TO MAKE PEOPLE ACKNOWLEDGE IT!

So much stupid on this thread but I am not the one doing it.
Please. I never said heart of the swarm was free to play. I said it was one time paid for expansion. Same with diablo 3 and reaper of souls. Overwatch doesn’t have season pass. The loot boxes you can unlock without paying a single dime extremely easily. Wow has a sub because that game is being worked on 24/7 365 because it’s an MMO. Like other premium mmos. 

So yes. Please go on? I would like to hear more of your biased opinion because you hopped on a band wagon.
>How can you not see that’s its relevant?

Because it's not. It not appearing in streams is not the same as it being banned and a punishable offense.

>If this is the first time then it sucks they all got banned, but it’s well within Blizzards authority to do so.

Who is arguing that Blizzard was not allowed to do it?

>If it HAS happened before then either Blizzard did the same thing and no one cared about it, or Blizzard did nothing.

Cutting the stream is not what happened here. Pay attention.

>So tell again me how it’s not relevant.

Because it's not. It not appearing in streams is not the same as it being banned and a punishable offense.
Don't care about people being politically savvy, you just care about being right and looking smart.
[deleted]
If it isn't relevant why did you use it as an example?
Tf do you even mean by you "research" your components? You track down where each gram of copper in every trace came from? You're comments make absolutely no sense. Explains a lot.
You're right sorry to intrude on the thread about moving a prepaid card.  Keep at it.
As I said, they represent the company. But whatever makes you feel better about supporting Blizzard.
I mean people can think however they want, I'm just callin em as i see em
Well, games like WoW that never had offline physical copies the answer is probably no. Once a key from a wow game is used it is attached to that account, if the account is deleted then the key is gone. What the OP was talking about 

>Hah, I knew holding onto these CD copies all these years would pay off.

is games like WC3 or the original SC that had physical media with keys that unlocked the content on the CD, those games will always be playable offline with the original key, any game that is solely run through the BNET launcher is not subject to those conditions, which is why holding on to the CD copies would pay off. I still have my WC3 set and can install it straight to my computer. 

And I never said you were stupid, I said the proposition would be stupid because then Blizzard would lose a shit load of money if everyone could just share their keys with their friends.

So the answer is yes and no, you WILL lose more current licenses but you wouldn't lose older ones.
I hopped on a bandwagon?  Jesus.  What is it you think you internet warriors are doing?
Obviously some people understood my point and you didn’t. So I hope someone else can simplify it enough so you can understand what the adults are talking about.
That's pretty much what you said in your last comment without the sarcasm.  Ya I got it.  You still have nothing to add to the conversation.  When you do feel free to post it.
Only if you have the proper thermal paste and correct socket.
I'm simply trying to say if I was a Samsung user.  A quick Google search showed me the Austin facilty. If I used their products and wanted to be responsible I would start there.  If I found out it was chinese imports branded as made in the USA I would move on.  Same with any company.  That's why I used the example.
Nah, that's the post. This thread is about the ownership of reddit.
No, they don't represent Blizzard. Are you crazy or just desperate to be on the bandwagon?
Idk what that is
Lol, ok kid.
I'll feel free to post anything I want to at any point. 

Nice misdirection! Big man does it again!
Fair enough.
Being pedantic must be your hobbie.  Have a great day.
The only desperate band wagon jumper is you. If I act like a fool in my work clothes outside of work my job will fire me. Hell they might fire me if they realize it’s me even if I’m not. A BRANCH of blizzard IS STILL BLIZZARD!
"I'll feel free to post anything I want at any point.  Nice Misdirection! Big man does it again!"  Nice projection.  Sounds like a Trump tweet.  XD

#BIGBRAIN
Thanks, I needed this comment for my bingo card.
Damn you're so salty about this video. Rather sad and pathetic mate.
Its not even a branch of blizzard. Its a totally different company.
Lol nice
Must be exhilarating
I'm not salty about the video.  Im salty about people thinking this is big brain shit.  And people like you defending it without a rational conversation other than "hurr hurr you mad"  If you wanna add to the thread feel free, otherwise keep the low brow trolling  for your friends.
Enjoy being a sheep. Bye sheep.
Very succinct argument.
Except you absolutely are. The video was clearly meant in a humorous way. Sorry that you love Blizzard so much that you can't understand that. I haven't seen a single rational comment from you, yet mine was. I simply called you out for being a salty boi.
Enjoy being crazy and ignorant.


You're like Trump, can never admit when they're wrong.


Obviously you thought it was blizzard initially and now we've worked our way to a branch of blizzard which they still aren't.
True.
Yes I love blizzard so much I stopped using their products before the social media outrage.  You totally cracked the case here sherlock.  Your cognitive dissonance is so bad with you that you claim I love blizz while I have been trashing them in every post for the last 3 hours... saying that I saw this trash comming.
How does the CCP boot taste?
Let's shake hands
Trashing them in every post? You do realize your comments are visible on your profile right? Only thing you're attempting to trash is a ton of people in these replies who got the point of the video.
Ya I do and I have said time and time again.  I stopped buying their products a long time ago.  Just because I think people are idiots for their most likely temporary outrage doesnt mean I support blizzard.
Because you somehow know it's temporary.

 K bud.
"Most likely."  Did you not read that part or are you just an idiot?
Still applies 100%. Sorry salty boi. I know you're very angry and have a room temperature IQ but cheer up.
IM TAKING THINGS OUT OF CONTEXT BUT I'M STILL RIGHT CUZ I SAY SO.  REEEEEEEE - NoPenguins_InAlaska
Yup, you just confirmed it. Salty, salty boi. My thoughts and prayers are with you.
Damn this person called me salty twice.  How can I possibly recover.
By not being angry. EZ PZ bucko
