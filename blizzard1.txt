Blizzard: We're listening to feedback, we're removing Mei from the game and any reference to her.
If you guys could settle on one costume / image / message.

For those of you with Twitter, remember to hit Blizz up there too.
In this house, we stan Mei.
Fuck Blizzard, they're supporting a genocide.
Does anyone think that these Mei memes are too mild?

She should say stuff like...

* "Down with the CCP!!"
* "Hong Kong Independence!!"

if you really want to rile up the Chinese government.
Fuck blizzards dude

I support HK protestors. Come ban my ass Blizzard. 

Oh that’s right, you can’t. Cuz I don’t play any of your trash.

Man, Im so torn about this whole thing. I love everything it stands for. But, man oh man, do I fucking hate Mei. Hopefully she gets deleted, and we can make Teemo the next icon for protests.
pretty sure they censored off the top post of the blizzchina flag. my husband posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blizzard/comments/dfzlm8/this_is_odd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) recently and its not showing up in the new feed.

Too bad that the voice actor supports China apparently
Can someone tell me what blizzard did that was so bad?? I've kind of been out of the loop 😬 haven't had WiFi and only been watching local news
They deleted the other mei one already

OK blizz we all want protest MEI to be the next character skin.
Somebody do this to hanzo also I would not complain if he was removed from game
I support this.
No offense but this is extremely low effort compared to stuff that actually should be at the top
I remember when she said this
Post the shit outta this I will 100% upvote anything on reddit that supports HK.
It won't make a huge impact but I don't want to support this company
 I sold the shares I had.
Mei says hong kong rights
I hope that everyone here really understands what HK is fighting for and isn't just joining a bandwagon
She is a fictional character that blizzard created. She is definitely on the side of the communist party.

Alright.
I’m gonna fucking laugh when they introduce riot gear Mei skin
I'm not up to date on gaming, but when I see a bunch of posts on reddit surrounding deifying a cartoon character to the point of making them an idol to stand up for freedom.... doesn't that seem pretty belittling to those individuals that are actually suffering because of the situation? It's kinda like everyone that uses cartoon characters as the face of civil movement isn't taking any of this seriously. 

I honestly don't know who the fuck Mei is, but I can guarantee that putting a cartoon character in a political position is going to get no results, aside from a temporary 2-week bandwagoning movement on reddit.
Unpopular Opinion: Game Studios make games, not political statements.

A game company should not be dragged into a political debate against their will. Its not their job to take a stance, its their job to make games for people to enjoy. Gaming in itself is an escapism, and should make efforts to not correlate with recent events, political or otherwise. Make no mistake, in actuality, this has nothing to do with the Hong Kong protests. This could have been about anything on the political spectrum, and Blizzard would have acted accordingly. If someone uses a company as a platform for political expression, I think it is perfectly well within that companies right to take action against the individual; ESPECIALLY, if there is literally a rule in place that the individual fully, and knowingly violated.

Side note: I never thought about Mei this way, but damn, pajama Mei was hotter than I thought

The new Honey Dew outfit...
This is why nobody takes gamers seriously. Using a video game character as a symbol for revolution is just gay.
Jeesh, I don't follow news much but it sounds like they are having a real humdinger over there. My uncle used to live there as a missionary priest...maybe they should just sell it back to British control, everybody wins.
\[The world could always use more heroes.\]([https://i.imgur.com/MT2Z7QK.png](https://i.imgur.com/MT2Z7QK.png))
she probably doesnts even know why they are protesting.  stupid ditz.

i'll have you know the British controlled  police in HK killed hundreds Hongkongers in 1967 when there was a protest against colonization. There was no democracy for 2nd class hongkongers under British rule.
Mei's VA actually supports China.

Partially why subverting her as a symbol of Hong Kong freedom is such a good idea.
What else can we do to send the message to Blizzard, China, and the rest of the world?
Remember! Blizzard does not condone any political activism of any kind!

Is the point of pretending to be apart of the Hong Kong protests actually just to get more fun things banned in China?

I hope Blizzard sees how serious everyone is.
Come join this group, let's protest at blizzcon!

Wait up, so if a player says impeach trump... would that player have the same violation as asking for freedom for HK?
The other overwatch people need to do more
I'm not a gamer. But I want to say I am inspired with what you all are doing and I greatly appreciate it. Ya'll might be the voice that keeps this in the mainstream. It seems we're not allowed to talk about this issue and corporate media is gonna let it all slide away. Powerful people now control the story and can make it go away. Think about the major news stories that have happened this year:

* Robert Kraft - he visited a brothel that, lets face it, is probably way deep in the sex slave/sex trafficking trade.
* Epstein- we all know the story and how far-reaching that could have been.
* Hong Kong- we see that ESPN and the NBA have already closed their eyes.
* General Motors- a major United Auto Workers strike is happening right now. And guess who is saying nothing? The very networks that air GM commercials virtually every break.

&#x200B;

We are in deep folks. Please keep talking.
Memes don't matter unless you get the competitors and streamres to alsop join the protests.

As long as they keep making money they won't stop.
Can someone explain where this comes from ?
Can somebody explain this meme to me?
Blizzard introducing Mei's new voice lines: "Long live the Chinese government!" and "I love communism!"
Mei is no longer Chinese, just a thick white girl. Hope you guys are happy
We need more of these... Whe are about to end this company whole Career

I like how all these memes are effectively advertising a Blizzard game and making it seem like Blizzard isn’t the bad guy here.  

I’m sure blizzard loves the skin concepts too.  Gives them a way to literally profit off this PR shitshow.

Delete this now
If you or anyone your know plans on deleting their account, don't just delete your account! You can request your Data from Blizzard and if they dont follow trhough within 30 days they have to pay hefty fines inside the EU. If everyone does this, they might have such an enormous backlog and will have to pay up. More details here: https://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/dfcncg/dont_just_delete_your_account_you_can_request/
Sadly, the voice actress likely doesn't share the same sentiment.

Pity.
I wonder if all the video game liberals will start to realize that censorship isn't so cool when its not them doing it.
Blizzard will have Mei say things like "I do not support Hong Kong protestors" during the game now.
didnt blizzard banned a HK supporter? hmm
War never ends
Fuck hong kong, so tired of reddit's current obsession
"Beyond The Grave!"
Please get the voice actor on record.
And we support you, Mei
Oh, hell yeah she does!
Is is actually the most childish way of protesting this
https://youtu.be/u_XJxqnxzaY🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼
Honestly, this "Overwatch charachter supports Hong Kong in opposition to Blizzard's decision" feels like a cheap ploy. Blizzard would benefit from it if players used it as an excuse to keep playing their game.
We need to find a way to get this onto weibo where they'll all see this.
Blizzard can take their censorship and wipe their ass with it.
You know for the amount of overwatch porn out there it would be really cool if we could animate mei saying that in an actual video.
Slowly prepares my rifle in the middle of the jungle with Chinese money in my cross hairs.
I place my wallet on a log and aim.
Suddenly Blizzard peeks through the bush next to me.
"Clever girl".
I'm so proud of the gaming community for making a change!
All these Mei memes are just making me want to play overwatch
I am torn by my support for the protesters and my hatered for the piece of shit, cancer of a video game character that literally ruined that entire game for me.

So why are you guys getting flack can you sum it up?
Probably the only way we can Mei removed from the game.

Mei is from China and was educated in China.

She would be pro-China and anti western fear mongering.

gross, do u guys have to make everything political?
You: Low effort karma farming not actually doing anything for the people of Hong Kong.
I'm just confused people are trying to use something blizzard created against blizzard. Mei supports Hong Kong? No she doesn't Because she's not real and in reality supports Banning the player since overwatch is blizzard. Do people have brains?
This is so gay. Really, nerds? This is what you've come up with? A fucking cartoon character?
damn she look like someone i know, shoutout Doreen. you are awesome and beautiful
Thank you Mei, very cool.

Oh hey you guys didn’t delete your sub lol

Such a low effort post I can’t believe it gained traction. Like I support this movement but come on, this one took a minuscule amount of creativity and effort.
[removed]
This is some low quality posting
Every idiot in the West and their grandma supports the violent riots of the traitors in HK.

If you ask them how they justify that nonsense they repeat meaningless, vague shit about freedom and democracy like some American parrot.

Literally not a single person I ever talked to in the West knows what's going on and why. It's fucking brainwashing at its finest.

Nobody can justify their support for these assholes destroying the city and ruining innocent people's lives.

The US is trying to ruin another nation. Glad to see that all of what's happening made Chinese people more patriotic and more aware of American information warfare and propaganda.

The US is a fucking evil country.

If you are one of the idiots supporting these riots: Have you ever asked yourself why? Do you honestly believe the propaganda you see? Don't you feel like huge assholes for not fact-checking and educating yourself even a little bit? It's fucking evil.

Edit: Look at the insane and evil comments I get in return already.

1. A guy attacking me personally and trying to dismiss me for being "a Sino poster" as if there was anything wrong with that. Zero arguments, no justification, as literally every single person ever criticizing China on this website.       
2. A guy using a "both sides" argument to justify anti-Chinese aggression even thought there is no aggression of China against the US and no propaganda. The worst China does is call out hypocrisy, asking the US to stop and retaliating against some offenses of the US. The only government demonstrating aggression and information warfare is the US. In terms of information warfare, the worst thing China does is censor American propaganda. Which is fully justified.       
3. Another guy attacking me personally while spreading anti-Chinese memes. Once again, zero arguments given. Like all people spreading anti-Chinese propaganda. A completely insane and evil person spreading hatred and disinformation unwilling to justify himself. This is a typical American.

How do you reason with such levels of brainwashing if the people spreading disinformation and attacking you refuse to provide arguments and deny reasonable discourse?

I swear I've seen that comment back when overwatch released, but for different reasons.

I mained Mei back then, Mai is bae.
Goddamnit we shoulda picked Doomfist
I mean I was in favour of the Hong Kong protestors anyway, but they'll remove Mei from gameplay if we use her as an icon? Double whammy win for me
Finally. The game is playable again.
that would be the best thing to come from this whole thing
Go get em girls!
And a high Social Credit Score will now be required as part of the authentication process for your login.
Blizzard: hey guys at least tracer is gay
Mei is definitely the best character to do this with, but should probably do it with Tracer too. Hell as many of the characters as possible, but Tracer is the flagship hero for Overwatch. She's the most popular by far. 

This analogy is not perfect, but its the difference in removing Mario vs Toad.
I wouldn't mind never again hearing her sorry voiceline after she decimates my team tho.
You joke but I wouldn't be surprised if they do this, at least in Chinese versions of the game

\#StandWithHK
As someone who doesn't play the game I wanna ask seriously: regarding all this brouhaha, is there any significance to the character other than her ethnicity? Because otherwise, I don't see what would stop people from doing similar things with other characters.
Also taking back anyone who won prize money using her.
Lol that would be hilarious honestly, the biggest FU of all time
She wasn’t forgotten at the base. She was abandoned there because of this.
i can relate and i would support Blizzard in this case.
To who?  Someone who never existed can't have references.
This was all just an elaborate long con to have Mei removed from overwatch.
Move on to tracer
I’d love to see them do that. That will fuck them so hard.
Who’s Mei? We’ve never had a hero in Overwatch named Mei! Sounds like YOU need a trip to the re-education camp!
Win-win!
> We are taking away any prize winnings for anyone who played Mei. Upon further review we have found the action of playing Mei has violated the 2019 Overwatch Official Competition Rules section 6.1 (o) and is individual behavior which does not represent Blizzard or OverWatch Esports.
That lessons the power of the meme.
It'll settle in. Remember that memes are like genes, you get a big population of them and then the most fit memes survive and mutate.
Well it is a meme, it should be adaptable.
I vote for the versions up on r/Overwatch_Porn

\#StandWithHK
I'd prefer if Mei was used in the HK protests like Pepe. Just put her everywhere and in everything rather than limit her to one message
That's the opposite of useful for this issue.  What people need to do is use ALL of Blizzards characters to support Hong Kong.

Force China to ban Blizzard entirely.
If it was just one costume, they could theoretically remove it from the game without major consequences. If it’s the entire character, it’s a bit more difficult to deal with.
How else would they be able to get easy free karma
Uh, no. It’s not as interesting to spam the same image over and over. A variation in images conveys the popularity of the movement. Also, the message from these memes has been fairly consistent.

I mean what could they possibly say that is really defensible at this point? They already banned the player, stripped away his money, and fired the commentators. The likelihood that they reverse all of that is basically zero.
I can't wait until they get on the stage and or drowned by Boos the entire fucking time until they quit.

They. Fucked.  Up.
23 days is a long time on the internet. We need to keep this going, no matter what shitty excuse blizzard think of. And if they backpedal? Don't let it go.

dicks out for mei
Best thing about this is that you don't have to be overly aggressive with China. A simple image of a Disney character is enough for them to lose their shit.
Or the classic Taiwan Numbah One!!!!
Something of her being teargassed or arrested would be great.
I posted this elsewhere, I'll post it here too:

Has no one considered that doing these Mei memes may endanger Mei's voice actor/family?

I'm all for protesting what occured, and what is happening in Hong Kong; but given how authoritarian regimes work, they may act against HER - and possibly her family - simply due to her association with the character; whether they are her true feelings or not.

Just food for thought.  I'd rather not see something bad happen to her because of this.
So you're giving up nothing. That's like a vegan boycotting Chick-fil-A.
You're so brave
This is trolling. Just because you have my opinion doesn't mean that this isn't a troll for attention that wants to start a fight.
And off is a tv channel
The Communist Chiness dictatorship started this. Don't be a commie lover
Gota love the pro commies turning a commie problem into a capitalist problem
I love how communists always have to find a way to make capitalism the bad thing, even though this entire problem started because of a communist country.
It's actually a Communism problem but ok
Way to railroad the discussion onto your particular issue of choice.
Remember that China's economic issues aren't a capitalism problem. It's a communist problem. The state will always be put ahead of people. Any totalitarian government organization will ALWAYS prioritize self-preservation.
What a stupid and economically illiterate comment.
Chinas not capitalistic though
Yes, but we do still want to have games lol.

The idea is to disincentive bad actions with monetary repercussions, as consumers or through govt. proxies. We can assume profit (in some form) will always be the motivating factor for achievement, no experiments has shown otherwise, the question should be what do we do with that knowledge.
Not exactly. The Communist Party of China led government has the power to outright ban Blizzard, NBA, whatever company from operating in China on the basis of people having different political opinions than the CCP because of their totalitarian system. If it were a free democratic country who believes in freedom of expression it wouldn’t have the same influence over these companies.

Yes, I blame the companies for bowing down to China, but at least in a free capitalist system we can do something about it, whether that be speaking out or boycotting. The CCP could put you in prison for that.
Considering that blizzard as a capitalist company has to compete for your dollar as well as with other businesses, this will reflect poorly on them and severely damage their profits unless they go do tons of damage control. In other words in order for blizzard to make money they need to make their customers happy, if they aren’t they go out of business.
Capitalism isn't perfect, but what alternative is there that would be better in this case?
Inb4 "reee that's not real communism". Yes yes it is. This is what you're fighting for. The death of liberty and personal choice and the birth of a new regime. Wake up comrade, you're hastening your own end under the boot heels of communist doctrine. That's what those brave souls in HK are fighting against, a world you want to condemn us all to
People are going to be shitty no matter your economic system sadly. Having regulations to protect consumers/citizens seems to be the best way to do things
Communist country: **kills and beats its own citizens, runs a organ harvesting concentration camp**

You: Those fucking capitalists.
Its a capitalism problem? ConfusedNickYoung.GIF
Someone humor me, without trying to educate me on Marxist literature or using communism as the solution.

But what exactly is supposed to be implied by the "capitalism" part? In my mind, i see it as a multinational corporate greed issue, caused by governments failure to regulate the issue. Capitalism can be a useful way to describe a significant aspect of the issue. *But*, the only time i ever see it used is to swiftly posit that "Revolutions", "Eating the rich" and/or that "Communism/socialism" is the solution as well as the direct counter part to capitalism (In the communist way of thinking). We're kind of ***dealing with the fruits and end results of communist ideas here***

It doesn't seem possible to label it as a "Capitalism" problem, without everyone immediately linking it to communism solution.

So to sum it up, i feel that every time capitalism is mentioned, useful discourse breaks down as tankies and teenage idealists utterly overwhelm the discussion with violent rhetoric, political grandstanding and whataboutisms.  
Capitalism is an apolitical concept of obtaining wealth. Unchecked and unregulated, it's bad. I just can't really understand why peoples mode of thinking is limited to "Communism Vs capitalism" worldviews, when i feel human kind is a bit smarter and original than to cling on to naive 18th century utopian ideas into the year 2000
TFW you are so good at mental gymnastics that you can talk yourself into believing that the world's 2nd most powerful nation, and self-described communist (and still functionally semi-communist) nation coercing a private corporation into silencing speech about brutal political crackdowns is somehow captalism's fault, and not explicitly the fault of the totalitarian nation doing the coercing.
It's not a capitalism problem, it's the people inside the machine that are the problem.
Yeah, because censorship doesn't exist in any other economical model.
Commie
nah. blizzard bad. /s
Human nature, not capitalism
it isn’t only a capitalism problem either, it is an authoritarianism problem working with a captalist problem
Capitalism on one side and Authoritarianism on the other
Well, companies need to start understanding that siding with brutal dictatorships is not a good business. Hard to do , but we can´t just sit back and take it.
Just go away, seriously, communist regimes are some of the most corrupt in the world.
shut up tankie
Capitalism is the best system we've come up with so far.

It has it's issues, nobody is disagreeing with that. But honestly I have yet to know of a system that has  worked as well as it capitalism has. It has yet to be proven inferior to another economic system.

Idk about you but I'm pretty happy living in a Capitalist society, no forced labor camps, nobody forcibly removing my internal organs, life is good.
The only reason blizzard did what they did is because of the **communist** state of China. Tencent has Blizzard by the balls
Lol. Classic communist
There is no ethical consumption under capitalism
This is a huge non-argument. You can't just search out a specific subreddit where people talk about news around this specific company and then drop something that completely shifts the discussion. You are ~~deliberately~~ shifting the discussion from "customers and others are voicing their anger at actions from a company" to "companies in a capitalist system are inherently immoral". *Edit, this was apparently not deliberate, sorry*


That's not the point here, because the way you post it and the timing of it only helps to keep that status quo. Instead of making people doubt capitalism, you only normalise it and help the criticism towards individual companies pass over more easily. You are the grease that makes sure criticism towards individual companies will not stick. 


This might seem like an ad homimem and it is. I won't call you schoolyard insults but I do feel like I need to call this out, I feel like you are approaching this ~~either~~ in the wrong way ~~or downright disingenuous.~~ There is nothing wrong with campaigning against a single company or getting upset at a single immoral act more companies do because it still shows cracks. If the genuine results are not in the changes made by a company, they are in finding more allies. 


People are better at seeing individual processes they disagree with than the entire economic system they are comfortable with out of familiarity. The best way to get people motivated is still a single cause, but for those motivated it leaves a lasting impact. With how open you are about your motives, I'd advise you to not say "it happens everywhere" but use this case as an argument against worldwide capitalism. If the list of cases becomes too long to put in a reddit comment, congratulations : you've only made your point stronger and can feel more righteous about wanting an alternative to capitalism.
You heard Riot censored some Hong Kong stuff too, right?
A hearthstone player shouted for freedom for HK on blizzards post game stream after a tournament.  This was against their rules so Blizzard banned them.

A lot of people on the internet got super offended and made the mental leap that this means Blizzard supports genocide
Surprised it took them that long
Look at me. I am de canon now.
Gyna?
"Hey the last guy was bad so you should just accept literally any mistreatment by a different expansionist imperial power."

Why not just leave Hong Kong tf alone?
[removed]
Why would they give a shit how their message gets out there? The people on the ground in Hong Kong want their message out there, they won't care how or why.  It's about getting the spotlight on the suffering they experience at the hands of mainland China.
You sound like Blizzard.
Found the Xi minion
People care about the message, but aren't super interested in the comments. Easy all scroll by upvote.
They're trying to make it into a symbol specifically so that it will get banned from China, thus forcing blizzard to take more action one way or the other. 

I don't think anyone is using this to belittle those protesters who are risking their very lives in HK, it's just a way to force blizzard into action.
Uncle Sam.
They made their stance when they issued an over-the-top punishment. If the player in question had just been warned, or even disqualified from the current event, no one would have a problem. The problem is they banned him from a year, took back his earnings from the entire SEASON, AND banned the casters who were just taking part in the interview. 

It was so over the top that it was an obvious statement to china that "no we don't support this"
When a company bans a streamer for supporting the protesters, they've made a political statement. They weren't "dragged into a political debate against their will," they jumped in.
> Game Studios make games, not political statements.

Bro have you *played* video games
Life is political, get used to it.
Already done in another thread
And no one will take your comment seriously because of your usage of gay.
Actually, a lot of people are boycotting Blizzard to show solidarity with Hong Kong, and it has turned into an international incident almost. The money is talking, and it’s because it’s not being spent. More public attention on Hong Kong, Americans seeing things about Hong Kong, and seeing an American company betray a collective ideal may be the first step into our government acting and attempting to negotiate an independent Hong Kong.
Why are you here if you don't understand what's going on?
Sadly, she's on China's side.
And how come every comment only has 1 point
I have no idea
I give it til October 11th before everyone runs out of meme ideas and stops giving a shit
Because I still have achievements I need to earn In WoW.
Because everything is political.
yes, Blizzard made it political first, this is a very good reply.
I think there hoping that if China gets offended by Mei they would ban overwatch, which would hurt Blizzard
IQ 0
meijor shoutout doreen
It’s so annoying dude
>Since you guys are protesting blizzard you guys are protesting your government,Disney and so on? No your not lol

I'ma need you to say that again but in English this time.
What a stupid argument this is. “It’s worthless to protest a great injustice if you don’t also protest every other injustice.”
Nothing in life is free sweatie, if you want gold pick up a sickle and hammer like everyone else.
New account for 4 days. What made you decide to make a account?
Yeah I support the message but this looks like someone's grandma posted it on Facebook
Oh look a Sino poster.
30 day old account in support of lying, communist, thieving China? No way this is a troll, guys. Put the pitchforks down.
The people of China are being sent to work camps, the people of China have every single move they make being monitered, the people of China are losing their jobs by just making criticisms on the Chinese government.  
  
The people of China aren't free in China and Hong Kong simply wants to not be a part of China. Even if that means mass protests.
There is propoganda on both sides. And both sides are call each other evil, you know
You sound like the one that's brainwashed haha
ugh, always gets me
Ugh I really needed to see this. I’ve been so overwhelmed with the sheer and overwhelming evil that’s being uncovered and publicly announced all over the world. From Trumps America, Russia, China and their genocide of Muslims along with their treatment of HK, the pedophiles and sex slave trade run by the worlds most powerful, the corporate stranglehold over my government. Thanks for this. There is some good left. It’s important to remember that.
It’s shrimp.
NBA already went against that shit... although might've been because of TOO MUCH pushback from China. Disney ofc won't do a thing, because so much profits. 

I'd like to see more to come, because it means they're getting public with that shit, rather than just dealing in the shadows. We all know most big shit bows to china, but to come in public like this? That's awesome to see.
How Chinese see the world can be summarized by a Chinese proverb, "普天之下，莫非王土；率土之濱，莫非王臣″,which means the world, including land and people, is the property owned by the emperor of China.
The NBA already went against China and therefore resulted in big china companys pulling their relation with the NBA. Good on the NBA for that one.
Technically you’re right. Hong Kong has nothing to do with China anymore :p
I deleted it
Whoops, lol
I don't see anything.
ASCII what you did there
dang, beat me to it.
[removed]
That's the biggest issue for me. They didn't just penalize the guy who made them look bad. They nuked everyone in the frame. Completely disproportionate. It goes right past trying to keep politics out of your gaming stream, straight into kowtowing to fascists. Unacceptable.
**Breaking News:** Valve has offered all of the teams behind Mei's creation jobs at their company and have invited Mei to join the TF2 roster
"And have rescinded all of their pay"
We are removing Blizzard for having such a character.
And banning any player who ever played her
"We apologize for  the fault in this characters design. The animators and design team have been sacked. Those responsible for sacking the people who have been sacked have also been sacked"
Why do that when you can just kill all of them and harvest their organs?
Zerg stand with Hong KOng!!!
Is this true or am I gonna get "wooooshed"?
We are even terminating the company that created her... Ohwaitfuckshitno.
In a effort to stay true to our ideals of freedom and tolerance, we will compensate our Hong Kong firings by introducing a pansexual demigender character. Also they are in a wheelchair.
Don’t give them any ideas
Ya wanna know what's a better protest? Cancel your sub. Stop giving Blizzard your money.
Even if you don't have a pandaren character you can still protest.
Wow was banned in China due to Wrath and the skeletons. It was unbanned around MoP. Hmmmmm
Exactly, and China isn't going to ban Blizzard for one character.  

#But if ALL characters from all Blizzard games are used, there's no chance Blizzard gets to stay in that market.
I definitely wanted her deleted sometime around release
*lessens
No it doesn't, it strengthens it. Gives it more focus.
This.  Next thing you know people will be saying how much people in China and HK "love to main Mei".
It won't settle in easily though. China's internet is very effectively isolated from the west. It's going to take a strong commitment to make this work.
Somebody should write a book about that...
Dudes find a pencil and really think they can do anything I suppose
Missed one, thanks bud.
Normally you're right but for something like this you really need ONE image to be spread. Like that picture of Putin in drag.
It's not about that really...

I've been seeing a ton of them, and many don't make sense. Out of context I wouldn't know what's being made fun of. Those ones aren't helping the cause, unless it's in spreading the characters popularity, bringing attention to her in general.
Maybe the blizz ceos arent putting out any pr because theyre busy blowing all the money on coke and hookers ... since they know the company is toast no matter what.
They publicaly apologized though... to the chinese government
**Technically** right
There is always hope! The commentators did nothing wrong, they should be allowed to continue working. Blitzchung displeased the chinese crowd but he won his earnings fair and square as he is not a cheater. The ban for 1 year is ridiculous and should be lifted. Hearthstone is a GAME, let the kid play ffs ! Silence his microphone if you must and put a disclaimer that opinions expressed by contestants are their own and does not reflect the companies ideas. That should be good enough.
this didnt age well
This will keep on going until they address the issue for sure. EA's reputation was permanently stained in the same fashion.
Honk Kong has stood defiant for MONTHS.   We must keep this up.

The beautiful fragility of the authoritarian ego
Their leader is a bear of very little brain indeed.
Ehh, I mean does it really matter? Gatekeeping people from showing support because they have nothing to give up is a slippery slope. 


Saying "you dont own any Blizzard games so you cant be apart of this" is dangerously close to saying "you're not from Hong Kong so you cant be apart of this"


Not exactly the same but a protest that gatekeeps is one that eventually loses support
Braver than our troops literally shaking rn
They've been capitalist for decades, dude. Try to keep up. How do you think private American corporations are operating in "communist" China in the first place?
who are the Chiness?
Anti-capitalism =/= pro-communism
It's capitalists putting money over human rights that banned the player. China's government is bad, but that doesn't excuse western companies that bow to their demands. 

Also, China is not communist. It's state-controlled capitalism with the profits going directly to the state. It's a mixed system.
Democratic People's Republic of Korea is bad and has "democratic" in its name democracy is terrible
What part of their comment seemed to be in support of communism? Fascistic communism (like in China) is bad, but so is oligarchal capitalism. You're allowed to criticize one without being "in love" with the other.
The CCP is authoritarian, and not communist (by their own admission “2 systems one China”). Don’t equate socialism with them.
Oh please.  China is a capitalist country with an authoritarian government.
Lol China is Communist the same way North Korea is Democratic People's Republic.

If it was communist it wouldn't have more billionaires than any other country. You think the workers there own the means of production? lol no
No the State Capitalist Chinese Dictatorship started this. 

When you try to conflate issues like this you just give the guilty parties a way to misdirect and funnel anger away. Call out them for what they are, not what your rhetoric would like them to be.
"Communists are poor!  Breadline Bernie breadline bernie!!!  "

"China is too wealthy and is becoming too big of a global market force!"
>Implying China is actually communist instead of a capitalist dictatorship.
Who decided to ban that player and take his money? Did China do that, or did blizzard?
The problem is that blizzard banned the player and took his winnings. Did China do that or did Blizzard do that?
The problem is fundementally that Blizzard is willing to side against human rights if it makes them money.

That is a problem caused purely by corporate greed.
Who made the decision to ban him and take his money? Did Communism do that, or did blizzard?
So discussing the root of the motivation of their decision is not relevant to the discussion?
China is in no way, shape or form communist. It's authoritarian state capitalism by definition.
That applies to any "NATION STATE" as is laid out in many foreign policies. Self-preservation of the nation-state at all costs, above and beyond even human rights.
Ever hearing of Deng Xiaoping my dude?
Are you implying that capitalism cannot have that issue? Because capitalist countries are suffering the same issues. The only difference is that instead of the state being priority, the top 100 people in the country are priority. 


It’s no different. You simply shift power from the government to the billionaires when you switch from communism to capitalism.
We have issues with both. Youre both right and both wrong. We understand. Do we still need these petty finger pointing comments?
Now you realise that government and business are two heads of the same disgusting ogre magi that have to be cut at the same time to kill the beast. You're arguing whether Cho or Gall are the enemy; Cho'gall is.
China is not communist...
China being a communist nation is exactly what they want you to believe.
Communism, political and economic doctrine that aims to replace private property and a profit-based economy with public ownership and communal control of at least the major means of production (e.g., mines, mills, and factories) and the natural resources of a society.


China is in no way communist at all please stop spreading this false information and educate yourself. 


**China is a capitalist fascist nation.**
China is communist like how North Korea is democratic, they're not and they just pretend they are to fool braindead tankies and dipshit reactionaries. That said, you are correct that any totalitarian government will always prioritize self preservation over the well-being of its people, and China is definitely totalitarian.
I hope you don't believe that my critique of capitalism is the same as an approval of China's behaviors. That would be incredibly short-sighted and narrow-minded of you. But I don't think that's what you meant.

But you are right about power and it's goal of self-preservation. That's exactly why we need to progress towards a stateless, classless, and moneyless society. Power to the people, comrade.
How so?
It absolutely is.

Or do you think North Korea is a Democracy?
How exactly, with it's billionaires?
We are talking about Blizzard. Blizzard is operated out of California. China can't put blizzard in jail for not bowing to their pressure. It was the "free capitalist" company's decision to ban that player because they have a single goal that is not motivated by human rights or any sense of morality. Under capitalism, corporations exist to make money. So that's what they did.
Or they could just ignore us and make money from China? Why would they care about some people online who are mad if it doesn't impact their bottom line. 

I hope it does. But usually companies will do bad things and then ignore outrage because the public has a short attention span
Didn't capitalism motivate blizzard to make their decision?
We aren't talking about the overall merits of two countries. We're talking about this specific situation.
Blizzard made the decision to ban the player and fire the casters because they value the money from the Chinese market over human rights. 

Not hard to understand.
100% with you on this. It seems there can be zero criticism of capitalism without the solution being a 180 flip to communism, as if one is the opposite of the other, rather than 2 separate economic systems. For a long time now criticism of capitalism marked u as a communist, which isn’t true, but now people are un ironically turning to communism as the only answer. 

I am an American and a Democrat, I personally don’t want communism. What I want is the system we have now, but with much stronger regulations, and much more accountability for the big politicians and corporations for things like lobbying, conflicts of interest, corporate mergers etc etc. 

In my opinion we are doing a terrible job with our system and we need to be doing a lot more and a lot better, but that doesn’t mean communism is the only way to go, IMO that is far from the only options we have. And as long as we can’t criticize capitalism without being seen as communists and without resorting to communism, nothing will change. 

As it is right now, criticizing capitalism gets u marked as a communist, and ironically a lot of people who don’t like capitalism are turning to communist ideas, which is fulfilling the very wrong idea that “criticism of capitalism = communism”.
> dealing with the fruits and end results of communist ideas here

EXACTLY, its mind boggling that someone would say "well they should move towards communism" when that is exactly why they are in the awful humanitarian situation they are
Why did blizzard make the decision? What exactly was The leverage that China had over them?
The machine is a good analogy. But what is the capitalist machine built to do? How many times have we replaced the pilot? The machine has one goal: you need to make more money this quarter than you did last quarter. That's it. We don't need a new operator. We need to dismantle the machine.
Technically that's true. Capitalism is just a tool that people use. It does not have motive or desire.

That being said, the point of capitalism is to accrue money and power. It's considered excusable to value such things over individual rights and freedoms. Because that's not the end goal of capitalism.
Capitalism encourages the problems of the people inside the machine.  It's a feature, not a bug.
The people inside the machine are following the incentives that capitalism creates.
It does. But shareholder systems and the expectation of everlasting growth have a part in those decisions.
Not being a commie. But this is how capitalism is
Apt.
Not being a commie is lame
Blizzard is literally the "side" that made the authoritarian decision.
Hey oh, I'll be the first one to be thrilled if it has any effect. But sadly in an economic system that rewards money making behavior no matter the consequence, I'm not optimistic.
And communist regimes are exactly what HK is protesting against! China's Communist totalitarian government IS THE PROBLEM HERE 

How dare they suggest that capitalism is the problem, it is exactly communism that has caused this crisis in the first place.
You clearly haven’t been paying attention to this administration or Trump himself at least since the 70s
Of course you're happy, those things aren't happening to YOU. You were born into capitalism and educated by capitalism. Don't you think it's suspicious that you can't imagine any other formation of society? I mean listen to yourself.

"I'm not a slave so I guess things are okay"

Meanwhile we are growing increasingly depressed, alienated, and suicidal because we live in a world that is ruled by pursuit of profit over human needs. We are capable of so much more. But the fact is, whenever people band together to try and reclaim that better world for themselves they're met with brutal retaliation. (Look at Hong Kong)

The people that own things want to continue owning them. Accumulation of wealth through capitalism ensures they have the power to do so.
On what measure is it a superior system? If you are lucky enough to be born into the winning country that has the most support of the economic powerhouses exploiting a majority of the world's population beyond your shores, you will live a better life by most metrics.

There are plenty of capitalist economic systems with forced labor camps in the world. When the forces of capitalism are left unchecked, their power monopolizes into an effectively totalitarian regime, like the East India Company in SE Asia.
Are you saying that the ownership of Blizzard can't make their own decisions? Is there some kind of other force that they are compelled to align with? Like say, the pursuit of profit?
Do you think there was anything wrong with what I said?
You've put a lot of words in my mouth. In no way did I ever say or try to suggest that Blizzard shouldn't be called out specifically as well as addressing the actual motivations of their decision.

I have to ask though. If I asked you to pull weeds from a garden, would you snip the stem or dig out the roots?
Yeah, but i stopped playing their shit a while ago
I don't get it lmao they're just trying to keep politics out of their game no? It doesn't seem like the correct platform to protest? Very odd
Hong Kong was a part of China until Britain invaded and established a colony during the Opium Wars.

You know, the war where Britain went to war with China to force them to buy opium.
This needs to be repeated everytime someone says WELL THE BRITISH DIDN'T GIVE THEM ANY RIGHTS EITHER
Yes, it matters that people who are taking action in any way understand what they are taking action for.
Thank you for answering that! But, I do have another question now... how is  getting a gaming developer banned going to help with the movement? I'm sorry if I seem disingenuous, I'm genuinely curious in how Blizzard is related to the movement in HK. For someone that doesn't game, the logic behind this escapes me.
They had no choice but to make a stance; and I honestly don't think they did anything wrong. Like I said, this could have been about anything; this could have been about marijuana legalization, gay rights, abortion, doesn't matter. Either way, Blizzard was forced to act, and I don't think they did anything wrong. They literally created a rule for this; a rule the player fully and knowingly violated. If someone uses a companies creation as a platform to spread their political affiliations, they shouldn't be upset when the company decides to act in its best interests.
Lets play a game of hypothetical's shall we?

Lets say one day you and a friend are walking in the park and witness a fight between two individuals. Your friend, without thinking, jumps into the middle of the fight. In the end, one of two original individuals ends up badly hurt, and the authorities are called in to investigate. They begin asking you questions about the fight, and more-over the extent of your involvement. Are you supposed to support your friend and involve yourself, or leave your friend to face his own actions? I'm pretty sure the choice is obvious.
<.< I'm honestly not sure how to answer your infinitely idiotic question.
Oh yeah, it totally is. Thats all my friends talk is politics. When I go to the grocery store, I make sure to spend 30 minutes in line debating politics with the cashier. I talked politics with the cop that pulled me over for speeding last week. I chew politics online with the guys I play Call of duty with. Some of my absolute best debates have happened with my spouse while we were playing hide the salami.
So you don’t take homosexuals seriously?
Do we know this for sure?

*I Wanted To Change The World*

When I was a young man, I wanted to change the world.

I found it was difficult to change the world, so I tried to change my nation.

When I found I couldn't change the nation, I began to focus on my town. I couldn't change the town and as an older man, I tried to change my family.

Now, as an old man, I realize the only thing I can change is myself, and suddenly I realize that if long ago I had changed myself, I could have made an impact on my family. My family and I could have made an impact on our town. Their impact could have changed the nation and I could indeed have changed the world.

Could you, for one second, just one issue, stop projecting your expectations for what Trump is and conflating him with every bad thing.

Trump supporters are some of the most fervent advocates for Hong Kong and opponents of the Chinese censorship state. Just one day at least could you find solidarity on a shared issue, go back to hatred tomorrow.
This has nothing to do with Trump lol, communist China is the enemy,and Russia is just irrelevant because they aren't as much of a threat as China
Trumps america is great, things are actually going pretty well for me (for once in my life). :D

I’m saying that mei has nothing to do with Hong Kong protest
But, If you think that Hong Kong is not a part of China, then a Chinese character shouldn’t have any relationship with the Hong Kong protest.
Rule of thumb is: they're not there to mark when you took a breath, but for grammar. They're also not a semicolon replacement.
We are even harvesting the organs of their extended family!

Fucking fired the interviewers for interviewing. Imagine being arrested for murder because you were a witness too a murder.
"Fascism" is a fancy way of saying "Right back to the middle ages" and it appalls me how many people think it's a good direction for anyone but the Royal Parasite class.
In the most devils of advocates, the casters did encourage him to say the thing.
"Nerf this!"
Sounds like the communist thing to do to me.
Holup, the interviewers were blizzard employees?
Perfect example of Blizzard adopting the guilt-by-association scare tactics that totalitarian regimes like China enforce.
It's mafia tactics. It's telling players that they won't just reap the consequences, but also the innocent bystanders in the crossfire.
Why even bother working with Blizzard as a caster if some random no can just scream Free Hong Kong and you lose your job. 

How in the hell will anyone at Blizzard still be employed after Blizzcon? I guarantee there will be a bunch of random signs behind caster booths throughout the entire day with "Free Hong Kong"
These are communists not fascists,  dont down vote me its an important distinction
Honestly, pretty sure Valve would cave to China's demands as well. I think they already have with Dota in one way or another. Corporations gonna corporate.

No, if everything Mei is a meme then Mei herself, not just a specific image, becomes a meme.
I don't necessarily like it but as soon as a game becomes big enough to have global followings, tournaments, and big prizes it is no longer just a game. It's a business product and the product owner (Blizz) is going to look out for their bottom line.

What will be interesting to see is if anything actually happens from the fallout. I'd like to guess "Yes" but the optimistic view has been taking a beating lately.

This is not just about Hong Kong (do not doubt my support) but freedom of speech for all. Blizzard has Chinese interests. China says "Make an example of this guy" and they jump. 

Many western governments have Chinese interests. Imagine if China could tell them to make an example of you.

Hang Long Dong for Dang Hong Kong
He signed a contract to not say anything politically controversial. What made it worse was that he put on a gas mask and support anti HK movement instead of an interview after his stream competition. Blizzard is shit but they punished him fairly .
LMFAO yeah so much more brave to post an anonymous comment on the internet than to get shot at...
**TLDR:** Chinese Maoist collectivism pressuring Western Capitalists. We can place the balance of blame however we like with that in mind.
China is authoritarian.  Not communist. If it was communist "the people" would truly be the decision makers.
If I go on overwatch and say “fuck the blacks” and get banned... do I blame blizzard or do I blame myself ?
The problem is that CCP can pressure Blizzard to ban someone. The root of the problem is Chinese government, not capitalism.
The fact you can speak out against Blizzard can and probably will lead to change. This is called the free market. If you were in China, you would have no recourse, without great risk. The risk coming from communism to the individual. In the case of blizzard they have acted at great risk to their company, not the individual, because capitalism and the free market allows for the individual to group against a company, whereas Communism obliterates any free thinking or speech.
Yes. There are plenty of companies that don't do this, so I think criticizing capitalism as the root of the problem is kind of off topic.
So fascism really. Private enterprise exists, but only with the state's blessing and allowance. That sort of explicit choosing of winners based on loyalty to the state is a hallmark of fascism.

And although it's not a required aspect of a fascist state, China's got the ethnic cleansing going on, too. They really like to buy into the full package.
No true communist fallacy. They denied anyone who wasn't a communist from even participating in government for over a decade. The situation you have described has arisen from them trying to salvage their country from the dismal failure of communism. 

They aren't purely communist NOW because they have started to accept some free market ideals to, ya know SURVIVE.
You are totally right. After Tinanmen a bunch of capitalist economists from Chicago got their go at China's economy and this is what ensued

> authoritarian state capitalism 

Well that just sounds like Socialism with extra steps.
Do people on reddit actually believe this?
Look, I hate capitalism as much as the next pal, but at some point you do have to admit that communism isn’t a panacea and that, Soviet-Era Russian jokes about “the true Communism” aside, authoritarianism can twist any economic system.
The "authoritarian state" part of authoritarian state capitalism (a term I only hear when I see tankies defending China not being True Communism) makes it capitalism about as much as "National Socialist" makes the National Socialist Party actual socialists.
Only because of the Simpsons
Dude that i responded to literally said that the socioeconomic problems facing a country that has tried communism harder than almost any other country ever has are the fault of capitalism, that kind of mindless propaganda deserves a rebuttal.
cyka blyat da comrade
Communist Party of China does horrible shit and strongarms Western companies to do business with them.

>omg it’s capitalism’s fault

“But the CCP isn’t communist” - since I know you’re going to use that argument. Technically, yes. However the entire party was founded under Communism (it’s in the name for a reason) and it follows a lot of its traditions and customs from its history. Blaming capitalism for these types of issues is really ignorant.
“Communist party of China”
Mostly Government controlled businesses, insanely high taxes, authoritarian government, insanely high government spending/financial support.
Did you even read what I said? It can’t put Blizzard in jail but the CCP has the power to ban Blizzard from operating in China over a political stance on free expression. That can only happen because the totalitarian CCP is in power.

> Yes, I blame the companies for bowing down to China, but at least in a free capitalist system we can do something about it, whether that be speaking out or boycotting. The CCP could put you in prison for that.
I would say greed motivated them. Capitalism has birthed the greatest nations and innovations the world has ever known. Communism stifles innovation and leads to mass starvation. It assumes that someone has the right to take what I've earned and give it to someone who didnt earn it in the name of equality. Communism says that you get to decide what me and my family needs and doesnt need, what we are and arent allowed to have. Communism is, in a word, evil
And this specific situation is in response to those factors.
Their entire investment into the Chinese gaming market.
" The machine has one goal: you need to make more money this quarter than you did last quarter. "

If you're publicly traded maybe. I work for a small business that's been making roughly the same profits for a decade, we provide a service people appreciate and are well compensated for it. Yet it seems you would say this to is somehow a bad thing?
I say we focus less on the Capitalist vs Socialist/Communist debate. Let the people of Hong Kong decide what works best for them in that regard and we lend them the support they need. We can argue that for ourselves later. The only thing that sort of talk seeks to do right now is incite division, when we ought to be united in support of HK.
That’s not how this works. Capitalism functions because it’s a two way system. A business will fail if people don’t buy from it.
Thankfully all of the pilots of the communist machines have already crashed them into the side of a geopolitical mountain. That’s why there are no more communist societies and why they inevitably fail. Communism doesn’t work, sorry. You’re young and naive, go read a history book and live out your communism fantasy internally. That way we don’t have to starve because of your idiocy.
No, capitalism doesn't encourage anything. It allows us to function as a free market. People who exploit it encourage problems inside the machine.
and there isn't anything wrong with that picture. the people who wish to fracture, exploit and dismantle it are creating problems for the rest of us. THEY are the ones who need to be held responsible. You ever try to play a board game with someone and they try to be sly and screw you over? Are you just going to throw the whole board game away and say the rules are broken?
So it's not a capitalism problem. Got it.
Stop trying to hijack this to push communism.
Big gay
Capitalist countries like [Taiwan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn) and [the US](https://www.npr.org/2019/08/27/754777224/u-s-companies-in-china-get-caught-in-the-trade-war-crossfire) work hand in hand with the CCP and have been since the 1970s. If you just blame communism because that’s the name of the ruling party you’ll miss the point, companies can deflect all the blame on the CCP and the system won’t change. 

The CCP cracks down on [Marxist students](https://www.npr.org/2018/11/21/669509554/in-china-the-communist-partys-latest-unlikely-target-young-marxists) harder because they actually challenge their political power and corruption. The guys waving British and American flags play into their propaganda that the protesters are CIA assets who want to return China to the 19th century where Westerners rule the country via colonies and threats of invasion.
I'll happily take the word from friends and my own experiences who did business in China or of friends who lived under the Iron Curtain and what they had to go through, than listening to your Trump conspiracy theories.
Okay so what do you suggest, you've obviously ascended some form of intellectual barrier that the other 300 million people in the U.S. couldn't, so enlighten me.
Yes, what’s going on in China is not the fault of capitalism. The government controls their market, it’s not a free market. The government decides what their people can and can’t put their money in. It’s a fake economy built off their communist government.
I am sorry for writing it such a way you think I said you are *not against the practices happening now*. I only meant that your comment shifts the discourse to something less tangible and in general, such comments actually have an adverse effect. That's why I used "wrong way to deal with it", I only once said it might even be disingenuous, I take that back.  I also said deliberately, I take that back as well. 

Still, I think this is a poor analogy because you know in that case what's the best answer and expect me to answer that as well. Of course taking the roots out is the permanent solution, but when I have a plant with poisonous berries I will be happy with just cutting at the stem so I can get rid of it. Your analogy works because the roots of the problem go very deep and of course you should try to tackle the real world issue at the roots. 

I'm happy you use a root example instead of something like a disease, because I've seen people call it a symptom and actually kill any discussion afterwards because they've then called it "just a symptom". 

But to play along with the analogy would pull the roots as far as possible, but I would not discuss using a plough because there might be some roots or seeds left. In this real world scenario, the roots are such an incredible black box that the only practical thing to do is cut at the stem and make sure it can't spread their seed.

Edit: To continue the analogy I feel that if you spend too much time discussing how to get the roots out, you might accidentally forget that above the ground, they are still weeds and spreading their seeds.
Yeah -  that would be the rational explanation.  They don’t want to people to use their platform for controversial content and especially not something that would piss off a lot of their customers.

But social justice warriors would rather view it as a company being in bed with an authoritarian regime.


I think a lot of this probably harkens back to American exceptionalism as well.  By any objective America has been a shit show the past few years but it’s it’s convenient to find a target that’s slightly worse to distract you from your own shitty situation.

Common propaganda technique as well which is why all the us politicians are frothing at the mouth over it.
Oh wow, someone aced World History in high school. Wtf does Britain even have to do with the current situation? And Hong Kong's residents evidently do not want to go back to being a part of China regardless of their history.

Self-determination and Consent of the Governed are fundamental to any government system. China has neither in this case on their side. Maybe make a point that's actually relevant to what's going on?
Well if we want to get technical, HK was part of the Qing Empire, itself a foreign Manchurian dynasty that conquered China invading from the north. So it was under foreign rule anyway, just changes owners from barbarians from the north to barbarians from the west.
the logic is that blizzard is supporting china over HK based on the massive overreaction they had to the support HK statement the player made on stream. I guess overall it's trying to show US companies that there ARE consequences to taking money over supporting free speech and human rights.
> when the company decides to act in its best interests.

That right there is what people are mad about. This is about showing US companies that there are consequences for choosing profit over human rights and free speech
How did they have no choice but to do what they did?  Couldnt they have just said that the views of the gamer involved do not represent the views of blizzard?  They chose to make a political statement, one that shouldve been obvious to them would not go over well with their customera
>Either way, Blizzard was forced to act, and I don't think they did anything wrong. They literally created a rule for this; a rule the player fully and knowingly violated. 

You have a valid point and Blizzard is entitled to take whatever actions be it socio-political-$$$ but I have the right to respond to their actions.

 
Honestly their approach was horrible, they could have handled it differently and reduced the burns. PR press saying, we don't host games for ppl to shout out politics. This is about gaming and unifying our love for it bridging our divide.... As for the commentators... just keep them hired but never host again till it blows over.... there are so many approaches to handle this. The realization is how much China told the company what to do... a US company(so far)
This comparison makes no sense but alright.
Blizzard’s disciplinary actions are the equivalent of the authorities throwing everyone in jail for being involved. Even the bystanders.

He didn’t use profane language. He is a young person that lives and breaths turmoil because of this current conflict. His words did not warrant the reaction he received.

China is using soft power to manipulate international corporations. Their censorship exceeds their own borders. That’s the core issue.
What? Your hypothetical depends on having no context for the fight, which we currently have in this real-world situation. Siding with a government to make more money on the backs of the oppressed is wrong, and if my hypothetical friend defended that I would not support them.
Video games have been political since the inception of the medium. Game studios being the ones making the games, they are the ones making the political messages.
Your reply seems to be sarcastically facetious, so my advice to you is this; perhaps you should be a little more interested in politics.  Whether you are aware of it or not, politics are the rules that create the framework by which you, me, our peers, our neighbors, businesses, industries, and all other groups are allowed to live, function and interact within society.  An individual may be able to hide themselves from the influence of politics, but a business or corporation will sooner or later be confronted with a political situation; that's the nature of our society- it's inevitable.

&#x200B;

On a related note, businesses and human rights have been intertwined since their existence, so this is especially inevitable, if that makes linguistic sense.

I wonder how mods about Blizzard's support of fascism.  I'd feel pretty shitty if the company I spend time supporter turned out to be pro-fascism.

But they'll probably just import some fascists from /r/sino to do it.  They are happy to stomp on their fellow citizens, they won't care at all about Blizzard fans.

^(Am I allowed to do this?)
Except they weren't just "interviewing," they blatantly lead into the answer by asking BlitzChung if he had 8 words to say.
They had a few seconds to make a snap decision. Punish the guy who premeditated his political statement, not the people who got out of his way.
Ah yes by hiding and ducking underneath their desk they have encourage it from Blitzchung.

Riiiiiight.
If a society is butchering its ruling class and causing famines through agricultural mismanagement, I call that society communist.

If a society is butchering minorities and using the tools of the state to concentrate power and wealth in very few, I call it fascist.

The CCP used to do one of those things. It now does the other. They went from being communists to being fascists, and the difference is very important.
They were paid by Blizzard, but they were basically content creators rather than employees.
Nobody except the CCP thinks the Chinese government is communist. If they were butchering the ruling class and mismanaging agriculture to cause famines, I'd call them communists. Since they're nationalizing industries as a form of social control and butchering minorities while concentrating wealth and power with a tiny fraction of the population, I call them fascists.
They already do. A few years ago they fired a Dota 2 caster mid tournament because it was in China, and the Chinese bitched about him.

They held The International in China this year, and it was an absolute shit show, because the chinese don't fucking care about anyone who isn't chinese.
Valve is big into China right now. Their user numbers had been stagnant for a while - they made an aggressive push into China last year and opened up Steam to Chinese users officially, which gave them a big boost in player numbers.

They don't want to lose that. It's the only growth they have since they already own most of the market already.
Making a game in a way that is legally allowed to make money in china and firing people for speaking out against fascism are completely different though?

Like, Valve was never a super blood-and-guts or ultra-progressive-signalling kind of company. Making a product that passes the Chinese censors doesn't seem like it'd violate their core values or anything. Why not put in the extra 3 hours of effort to verify that they can sell in China?

If they were injecting money **into** the Chinese economy then maybe there'd be some problems, but I don't see anything immoral about taking money from Chinese citizens.
Valve are already working with China for their own version of Counter-Strike as well.

Freedom of speech =/= free market
You don't think that lots of companies choose profit over human and environmental well being?
Fascism and Communism are both totalitarian ~~forms of government~~ *economic systems* that are enabled by the false promises of socialism. They aren't polar opposites, they are the same in all but semantics.
Very much so, yep! Claiming they're communist is like saying the Nazis were socialist, Korea's a democracy or the Westboro Baptist Church believe in Jesus - plot-twist, it's basically a hate cult posing as a religion.
Fascism requires more than just "authoritarian right", but they're more similar to it than any other form of government.
Remember Tianneman Square? 

A lot of those protesters were communists

But also no, you are kinda just wrong. You are confusing communist, the socio-economic view/system as envisioned by Karl Marz and early socialist thinkers, with The Communist party, which uses communist language to justify an authoritarian regime. You have to be a member of the CCP to participate in government. 

And yeah, by definition, they are State Capitalist. The state, not the people, own the means of production.

The problems that China had were because Maoism is the idea of "agrarian socialism" and is fairly dismissive of industrialization, as well as the fact it was a centrally planned command economy, not a market one. This is the same problem the Soviet Union had. Command economies are not good at dealing with changes in supply and demand as easily as a market system is, especially over such a large country.

(and no, market economics is not capitalism. capitalism is the private ownership of the means of production, state capitalism is when that is the state)
Communism has a definition which they clearly don’t meet. Not even a little bit.

“No true Scotsman” doesn’t let you dismiss people who are telling you that you don’t understand the definitions of words.
And the Nazis said they were pursuing a socialist agenda... after they killed all the socialists. 

Newsflash: Evil authoritarian regime lies about its goals in order to retain power.
It does at face value, but it's not.  Companies are not run by the government, they run EXACTLY as companies in capitalist countries do.  The only difference is that the government will force them to comply with whatever it is they're doing to keep their hold on power this week, typically by crushing dissent from the bottom.
Except that you’re incorrect. Italy under Mussolini was a state capitalist nation and you know who they took as prisoners or killed? Communists and socialists.
Only if you don't actually understand the concept.
Socialism means worker ownership of the means of production. With this in mind, how does authoritarian state capitalism resemble socialism at all?
I never once claimed to be communist, or in support of it. Marx had a valuable analysis of capitalism back in the day, but it's hardly relevant to our society or how modern capitalism operates. Kautsky and Lenin applied that analysis - dictatorship of class - and warped it to create their reformist take on communism - dictatorship of a party - the authoritarian state capitalism that became the USSR. 

So, this isn't me being pro-communist - Tankies killed far too many of us when the tides turned - more...helping to educate those who take things at face value and buy into the western red scare.
I'm not saying I fully agree with Karl Marx (he was a modernist after all and kinda ignored a lot of fine details), but this isn't exactly fair either.

The reason people say "not real communism" or whatever is because in Marxism, the ultimate goal is absent of a state, money, or social classes. Therefore, by definition, the USSR and PRC are not communist (going by marxism). This is largely why they each created their own interpretation and concepts that mimic it, but basically go "yes i like this, but what if i changed it to fit my needs?" 

Its honestly very similar to what the NSDAP and other fascists of the time. They took socialist ideals, such as uniting the working class, anti-capitalist, anti-class distinction, etc, and twisted it into something completely different, typically with a massive dose of nationalism, xenophobia, and anti-semitism. Hell, early NSDAP (as the DAP) advertised itself as "socialism, but without those dirty jews and communists, who are also jews." They also softened their anti-capitalist stuff to again, focus on jews rather than the Bourgeoisie. 

Point is, authoritarians twisting leftist ideology to suit their needs and attain and maintain power is nothing new. Leftist thinking is just really popular with working classes and its kinda hard to start a revolution or get enough votes without a lot of people behind you.

Just cuz someone calls themselves Communist or Socialist doesn't mean they are. Actions speak louder than words.
“Trying communism” is a pretty empty analysis. There are a lot of countries like Burkina Faso and Cuba who have had communist governments that gave a net benefit over capitalism. 

Former colonial countries like China and Vietnam gained strong Marxist-Leninist parties because they advocate for anti-imperialism. No where in the developing world has there been a successful capitalist country because capitalism relies on exploiting the natural resources and labor of other countries. That’s why China is so powerful today because they opened up to the West in the 70’s and whored their workers out to American, Taiwanese, European and Japanese businesses.
How did they try communism so hard? They've never tried communism. They had a planned economy that was owned by the state and an authoritarian dictatorship. None of these things are inherently communist except "state owned means of production". However, that state could be Democratic and the economy could be be based on responding to market demands....

The rest of what China does and how it is structured is not communist. They call their party that.. but that doesn't mean that's what they're doing.
How did China strongarm these businesses? Did they threaten them with violence? No, they didn't.

It was the American companies, motivated by the goals of capitalism, that chose profit over people. They could have said " you know what this is wrong, maybe we won't make as much money next quarter but we need to stand with common people and assist them as best we can!"

But they didn't. And they won't. And we all know why. Shareholders need their paychecks.
>do you think North Korea is a Democracy?

Come on dude at least TRY to read what other people are saying.
You’re leaking dumb apologia on this thread bro you might want to add some critical thinking and actual evidence to that drivel.
So, Blizzard wanted that money?
Your business sounds great, the problem is capitalism will tend to take businesses like yours and have them merge with large conglomerates that don't operate with such community-driven principles, but only profit and often more important share price.
Of course not. It's on a spectrum. I'm not talking about the act of producing a product or performing a service and being compensated in some way. I'm talking specifically about the parasitic elite who use their extreme wealth and power to exploit others and dominate the natural world to it's detriment. It's the system of capitalism that allows them to do that.
Generally, yes. At least from an economic perspective, you want to maintain constant growth as much as possible.

&#x200B;

Basically comes down to two scenarios:

1) If the business is making positive growths, than then everybody who is working for the business would have a greater opportunity for more income. More income for the business can lead to more money for the employee's. 

2)  If the business is not growing, then it is highly likely that nobody is going to be getting any raises anytime soon. 

&#x200B;

Sounds like you could find some room for growth. Put more  money towards investment, delay consumption, or work on innovation. This will help the growth of the business!
At a certain point it is near impossible for people to take mobilized action against a corporation. Comcast, Nestle, Koch industries are all examples of corporations most people can’t ignore whether out of necessity or ignorance. Capitalism as it stands in a democracy means that it favors the rich in politics, when you’re running for office in a capitalist nation the richer you are the easier time you have generally. And the richer you are the easier it is for you to lobby. Now you can set the rules of democracy to favor you. Never mind that you can also do it through mass media, after all you are a private company right? It’s your opinion truth be damned.
I made a pretty small statement that somewhat covers the base. I can elaborate, but my point is that everything inside the "machine" is independently causing it to function. It is modular enough to resolve/replace elements inside of it instead of throwing the whole thing away.
No one has said anything specifically about communism. The solution is democratic socialism, in the manner of northern european countries.
>You ever try to play a board game with someone and they try to be sly and screw you over? Are you just going to throw the whole board game away and say the rules are broken?

I don't think you've really thought this analogy through. A board game is something you play by choice, no one is forcing you and everyone involved usually knows the type of game being played. On top of that the goal of the game is to win, and what winning means is different depending on the game. In a competitive game, like twilight empirium,  you want to get 10 victory points before anyone else, and dicking someone over is a regular part of play. But then you also have Dead of Winter, a game where you and the other players are trying to survive a zombie apocalypse and winter at the same time. This game is cooperative, and everyone wins or loses together. Screwing a player over in this game is a bad idea since success is shared and you'd only be harming the teams chances.

These are just board games though and if I decide at the end of a competitive game that I'm tired of getting screwed over by players who managed to get a better position than me, I might then suggest we play a cooperative game, or we could stop playing games and find another activity. 

Back to real life though where the stakes matter and you can't opt out, capitalism is a competitive system by design. It rewards a handful of people and punishes the rest because, just like in a competitive game where the objective is to win, capitalism's incentives directly push people to aquire more capital. You invest capital, you hopefully get more back. Keep doing that and you are successful, fail and your capital goes to someone else's pocket and they succede. In capitalism in order for some to win, others must lose. Play the game long enough and this divide between initial winners and losers starts to look pretty stratified. It doesn't matter who those people were, or what their values were, they will continue to follow the incentive structure they find themselves in. Replace them with others and the results would be the same.

If that board game had real impacts on my financial well being and I was obligated to play simply by being born, and the sly player who pulled one over on me got to live comfortably with few troubles while I was considerably less comfortable and financially secure, yeah I might want to tear up the rules and get started on some new ones.
Do you really not think that a shareholder centered business model with a single prime directive of constant quarter after quarter growth is not the exact description of our current capitalist economy? Not sure what you think capitalism is then.
Do you agree that companies often, in the pursuit of profit, disregard what's best for human beings?
Ah yes, stop trying to hijack major political and social problems by proposing political and social solutions.
i don't think we need communism. we need something that is more nationalistic than communism. something like national communism, maybe it could be called national socialism
I suggest that common people be in charge of their own lives. I suggest that we no longer allow a select few of ultra wealthy individuals to decide how and when the resources of our planet are distributed. I suggest that workers be the owners of their work places and that they receive the full value of their labor. Is that so radical?
Blizzard made the decision to ban that player. Right? Why did they do that?
I understand your point, I just disagree. You are right that is a less tangible subject. The difference is I believe that is only the case because of, in part, your thinking. 

By your logic we will never end up addressing the root causes of the problem, so they will continue to sprout. Obviously it's important to do damage mitigation in the process (cutting poisonous berries), but at a certain point you need to solve the problem. Because the fact is we can't get to every single one of those plants before the poison berries fall and people get hurt. We can't just keep mitigating. 

And to the overall point that is a problem that I'm shifting the topic: I'm fairly certain the tens of thousands of comments and threads and anger directed towards blizzard specifically will not be harmed by my single point of view. I don't think I'm that powerful.
It was literally a lesser of two evils. Their would have been consequences no matter what they did. What people should actually be concerned about is the fact that they were forced to make a choice in the first place. 

If you were the head of a major company that was suddenly, and through no fault of your own, put in a position where you forced to make a response that would not only involve you in a highly controversial issue/event but also lose you business no matter the decision you made; would you not have reacted in the same manner? 

Lets face it, even if you didn't react the same way, this is a matter of: damned if you do, damned if you don't. At the end of the day, Blizzard is no more responsible for what is going on in China than you or I. And they shouldn't be punished for getting thrown into something they didn't want to be involved in in the first place
They literally have a rule for this kind of thing. Were they not to enforce it and make an example of the player, this kind of thing would just happen again. There is a Chinese proverb:

The nail that sticks out is hammered down.

The player should have remembered it.
Care to make your own comparison?
There is nothing wrong for a young person to have their own opinion, but when they involve others who want nothing to do with it; there will be consequences. The player could have taken their earnings and donated to the cause, but instead, they were foolish. The fault is on them, and they should take the fall. China was given the power by the player himself, when he involved a much bigger power in the situation; and it backfired on him in a big way.
They would have been screwed no matter what they did; and that's the point. They never would have been involved had someone not wrongfully abducted their platform/event for political expression.
Oh yeah? What was Mario's political message? Legalize shrooms?
So you protesting Disney to right? Won't be seeing the new spiderman movie and so on? Throwing out all your marvel stuff and so on. Come on don't stop there. Search every product in your home and throw it out if it says made it china.

Otherwise your a hypocrite

So... Not a single one of those things are actually true. He has not gone after welfare. Has enacted first steps programs for disadvantaged released inmates, and regularly call for spending on American infrastructure instead of endless wars (which he has effectively ended.

As far as breaking the law, well nobody can even state a law he broke, and the transcript of the call that is supposedly a loaded gun completely negates the idea if you actually read it. The only thing he mentioned was that Biden openly bragging about getting a prosecutor fired and blackmailed him with US foreign aid money, which he did do at a council of foreign affairs conference.

He never asked a foreign government to interfere, the investigation was already in existence, but was squashed by the previous administration. The current administration finding out about this and making an inquiry is not only not against the law, it is actually his job and there is plenty of precedent for cooperative corruption investigations running between countries.

And like I said, yay we aren't bombing people for no reason anymore, pretty good for the world when we finally have someone sane enough to say "hey... Maybe we... Stop destabilizing countries"
> Sounds like somebody is trolling lol. You’re cool with a world leader brazenly breaking the law, asking foreign countries to undermine your democracy and destroying every gov program that did anything for anyone who isn’t a billionaire? UM. Ok.
> 
> But things are going well for personally eh? Obviously politics in the country are going well!

> Plebeian ....

I wasn't talking to you.  

:)
? You know that she’s a video game character right
There are
Yes, that's their effect, but not their purpose :)
Blizzard will do anything for that sweet sweet money.

Anything.
So...that's horrifying.
Isn't that customary?

I could see if they said "what are your thoughts on the political climate?" Or something like that.

But if they asked something like "do you have anything to say?" Then they were just doing what they would do for ANY winner.
The man came up to the interviewers in a mask, and he's from Hong Kong. The only way they could stop him from saying it is to cut off the broadcast, which is a job for the producer, not from the shoutcasters who *must* interview him.
Didn’t one say something to the effect of “ok say the line and we’ll end the interview” showing they knew
The former inevitably leads to the latter.
You have to be kidding me here, their longterm plans smack of everything thats communist. Letting their people have money at this point is showing the outside world a face they want you to see. Their beady little hearts are all about brother no. 1 and the red book. When they feel they have the control they want watch what happens, itll make the cultural revolution in the 70s look like day in the park. Why arent we as consumers at this point demanding all companies divest manufacturing from this country. Hong Kong and the muslims genocide should be reason enough not some gaming platform
To be fair, the Shanghai Shitshow was well... a shitshow.
At the very least, Valve goes complete radio silence, instead of actively supporting the Chinese.
> It's the only growth they have since they already own most of the market already.

What do they do when china player base plateaus.

Nm, they gonna go after the current 3rd world slum dwellers.
No one is saying Valve pushing into the Chinese market makes them pro CCP, the poster above you was just pointing out Valve are likely not going to do anything to harm their main window of growth. If Blizzard fires the design team behind Mei in this hypothetical, it means they were probably pressured to do so or felt like if they didn't it would be problematic for them with their Chinese business partners. It's safe to assume Valve would figure the same thing and not risk it by hiring them lol
Wait, is that legal?
I guess we'll see. I sure hope that is true.
Bigsn't
Allegedly he broke some part of his contract? Didn’t look further into it.

Have you ever considered changing your user name to something more appropriate like "imsimpleminded"?
What you're doing is criticizing a consequence of the issue rather than the real issue. This whole situation would be non-existent if China was just less authoritarian, and if they were less obsessive about political dissent. The overt censorship the government routinely employs is proof of this, and as a result Blizzard either loses something like 50% of WoW players, or they do what they did. You see how it's not Blizzards fault that the Chinese govt. put them in this position? I'll say this, I think what Blizzard did is morally wrong, but when you're considering the livelihood of your business what they did seems correct.
Sure they do. But to fix this particular problem, you don't have to overthrow capitalism. This particular problem can be fixed in a number of less violent ways. Great news, right?
Communism is not a form of government. It is an economic system.

Most governments that have *claimed* to be communist were authoritarian but you could have a democratic, communist country.

Just like you can have a capitalist dictatorship.
If Facism an economic system? I was under the impression is was a method of governance but I'll have to go take a look into that now

Edit: Did a quick google and found that part of a facist government has to do with the way they regulate and restrict the economy. I did not dig deep into this so if anyone wants to correct me or add a clear, concise definition please do so.
That's inane, if a country is capitalist but lies about being socialist in order to gain public support at first, it's no less capitalist.
Fascism is a political system, not an econimic one. The fact that it has economic implications does not limit it to an economic system.
The communism understander has logged on
The "national socialists" who made all industry public weren't socialists? interesting theory...
>And yeah, by definition, they are State Capitalist. The state, not the people, own the means of production.

So *exactly* the no-true-communist fallacy as stated above. It's funny how all the countries that call themselves communist end up going down this route.
Regarding state capitalism being the state owning the means of production versus capitalism being the private ownership of the means of production: what system isn’t capitalism then?
Market economics cannot exist with public ownership of the “means of production”

Private mobilization of resources gives way to a market economy. Public ownership removes that possibility and thus leaves you with a command economy as the only option. 

You were right until the last part where you tried to hand wave away how market economies work.
Probably the most well researched and stated comment regarding the meme that China is communist and tossing out the "no true scottsman fallacy" incorrectly in response to people accurately pointing out that they're not on Reddit.

Also, bravo for detailing how much more nuanced the subject is.
Great write-up. Thank you.

Also, it's crazy that this kind of dialogue is happening in r/Blizzard. Crazy times.
I don't think Italy under Mussolini is a good example of anything except how not to run a country.
Cuba has had a net benefit from communism are you insane? LMAO
>their plans to fully transition over to a communist regime never passes the "dictators take over" phase, so it never actually failed! This glaring issue isn't in any way tied to trying to move to a communist nation!
> Shareholders need their paychecks.

How exactly do you think this works?
> The Communist Party of China maintains that despite the co-existence of private capitalists and entrepreneurs with public and collective enterprise, China is not a capitalist country because the party retains control over the direction of the country, maintaining its course of socialist development.

This is literally the first thing that shows up when you google it.

I’ve written so many essays on this. If a political agent is forcing it to be a certain way, it’s impossible for it to be capitalistic.
Capitalism is basically let people do what they want with minimal regulation. Yes this leads to abuse, yes it leads to environmental damage, yes this leads to the rich getting richer. and unchecked greed. However, this system is still a thousand times better than having some governmental fucks micromanaging your life under communism or heavy socialism.

Companies get too powerful, greedy, and evil, you stop buying their products and they lose their power. Governments get too powerful and evil you have to start dropping bombs. Which is scarier to you?
Imagine being so insane that you think communism is a good thing. Man that's always what gets me, it's always the entitled people who've never truly known oppression who come around thinking "hey this communism idea is pretty great". Forgetting the millions upon millions of dead and failed governments that have already tried it.
Yeah, they chose not to destroy the lives over all of their employees to make a political statement. I don't agree with the situation but the problem is that the Chinese government has realized total control over the economy through the false promises of socialism which has given them the power to silence any opposition.
What you're arguing is taking private enterprise away from everyone because corporations are shit.
You’re literally suggesting they be part of the problem
Yea... I mean... it's retail. There's a pretty hard cap on salary, based on the industry standard. Profits wouldn't (and haven't) effect(ed) that.
... that’s called capitalism, bud. This individual was absolutely talking about communism. Nordic countries use a capitalist system with social safety nets. Reddit truly is a mindboggling place.

“Raaaahr fuck capitalism but no wait I don’t really understand what capitalism is!!” - you guys

OP literally admitted he was pushing communism. Tankie sympathizers are hilarious. It makes me sad Hong Kong has to try to convince people like you.
The socialist parties in those countries get 10% of the vote. Only Portugal & Spain have democratic socialist governments in Europe. You are misinformed. The US as it is now is not economically very different from Northern Europe, they just have lower taxes on the middle class. Businesses run the same way.
Nobody said that, dude.
Companies harming the environment in the pursuit of profits doesn't mean communism or social democracy do it any better. The only reason that might be the case is because it's harder to pollute as much when you're poor.
No




cringe
Yes, they do. But the problem isn't the system, the tenets of Capitalism don't tell anyone to exploit the less fortunate. Humans are just like that, evil people exist everywhere in every corner of the world.

There are tons and tons of companies in the U.S. run by good people that do good things and treat their employees and customers fairly.
It's not a solution, it's the problem! That's the point.
HAHA right?
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
Okay and how does that work? That sounds like absolute chaos. I agree the ultra wealthy class should be eradicated, so there's that. But having common people be in control of their own lives? What does that mean?

And how would a collection of workers owning businesses work? If I started a new business do I automatically have to give away 50% to my first employee? The current incentive for people to innovate, invent things, and create businesses is to gain wealth. If you take that incentive away why would anyone have a new idea or invent something or cure something? The main issue with the current system is that there aren't enough protections for employees.

The point of the CEO is to have a "leader" who makes the ultimate decisions and is held liable for the actions of the company as a whole. But nobody is there regulating how much they pay the workers, that's regulated by the market, and normal people severely undervalue their own time. Unfortunately people can't do much about it because there will always be another person who willingly wants to work for less money than you do. This is why illegal immigration is even an issue in the first place, because it floods the market with dirt cheap labor. This is why we need better protections as employees.

Your ideas sound great on paper, but they fall apart the second you take a closer look. They run on the idea that every human is a good person who has everyone but themselves in mind at all times, and that's simply not how it works.
You're right in that I might seem defeatist after writing my comment. Black boxes can be unraveled with enough efforts. I'm not defeatist but the idea that roots go very deep will always be a bit ominous to me. So I try to unravel the black box at the one end but at the other end at least show my concerns about Blizzard and their most recent PR disaster. 

And btw, your comment I went into so aggressively was one of the most visible comments on the most recent big post on the subreddit. That carries a lot of effect but I might have overreacted a bit though.
They could have simply said, "Blitzchung has violated our professional contract and due to this we are officially warning him and banning him from the next event". 

No one would have had a problem with that, Blitzchung knowingly broke a rule and people understand blizzard had to do something. What people are concerned about is how over the top blizzard went to ensure that China wasn't offended in any way. They made it very obvious that they support their Chinese market rather than free speech and human rights.
That's why it's our duty to protest Blizzard. The alternative is 'damned if you offend China, no consequences for offending the west'. In that world all international companies are only incentivized to appease China. Appeasing the censorship of a dictatorial country is rightfully offensive to the west.  We like our western media to not be controlled by the whims of authoritarian regimes. Sure maybe it's unfair that Blizzard can't appease China and the west, but the west would actually like to see China not having control over global media. The fact that they 'have to make a choice in the first place' is China's fault and we don't have to take that sitting down.
Lol of course it would be a chinese proverb.  Yes Blizzard can choose to make these rules, and of course they can choose to enforce them.  Your original point was that they had no choice.  Of course they had a choice.  And choices have consequences that they are experiencing now
For what?  Why do we need make believe comparisons?  Just look at the actual situation for what it is.  Game company chooses to punish a player and employees for voicing their political opinions, to please their chinese overlords.  Nobody forced them to do anything
Blizzard’s disciplinary measures inflated the situation and made it an international headline. 

When all is said and done though, Blitzchung knew the consequences of his actions. Another card game company offered to pay him for his lost winnings. His message has been spread further because of the situation.

Its just unforunate to see censorship this extreme in Esports. I grew up hating televised sporting events because players/teams felt like walking billboards with no personality or opinions.  Platforms like YouTube and Twitch have given professional gamers an individual identity among the mass. 

I’m just sad 😞
Mario is more a metaphorical political message, but you probably don't believe in metaphors anyway. Most old games are the same way.
I haven’t seen a Disney movie in a while. The marvel movies suck, I’d never pay to watch them. I’ll admit I probably will have to keep my clothes because it’s near impossible to find clothes that aren’t made in China so you got me there.

Just because you’re too addicted to WoW to quit doesn’t mean everyone else is. The very least you could do is not flame people for standing up for that because it just makes you as bad as the Chinese government. At a certain point people’s  lives mean more than a game.

Btw I played on Blameux, would rather delete my account than give my gold to you :)
I honestly can't name the last Spiderman movie I've seen. I've never owned something about Marvel in my life. Anyway, that's besides the point. 

The manufacturer of my light bulbs isn't publicly stating their support for organ-harvesting Commies like your beloved Blizzard is doing.
I'm literally some black dude with blue eyes. But ok.
Emoluments clause?  Heard of it ? It’s also illegal to ask a foreign government to interfere with our democracy. He’s lied to the American public in general and has arguably sold out the highest office in America.  He calls for better infrastructure spending ?  That’s the best you could come up with after his four year term comes to a close?  Sounds like a real hero ...don’t waste too much time reading this....Fox and friends awaits you ....
Take that statement and apply it directly to original comment lol
There are what?
A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G ^^unzips...
The interviewers is leading Blitzchung to say those eight words which is the ongoing political issue in Hong Kong. If Blitzchung is saying those words on his own accord which is fine, but the interviewers is leading Blitzchung to bring up a political statement which has nothing to today in a video game industry.

I don't think Blitzchung should be banned, however the interviewers should definitely get fired.
At our current level of development, yes. It probably works better once we automate away all the jobs humans don't want to do. And it's not like capitalism doesn't kill millions, it's just less obvious when it does.
I completely agree we should be divesting ourselves from this evil regime. I'm just explaining why this evil should be called fascist, rather than communist.
They moved the world's biggest e-sports tournament to China this year. 2 months ago.

Gaben LOVES the taste of Jinping's boots.
Why is it safe to assume that any corporation would bow down to communist fascism unless they've already pointedly done so? I understand corporations exist to make money, but why is everyone suddenly acting as if one has never hurt their bottom line for a matter of morality, even if it was public facing for maximum PR?
>No one is saying Valve pushing into the Chinese market makes them pro CCP

I sure as fuck am.

If you are outside China, and you want to do business inside china, you **have** to go through the chinese government. That is the way their government demands business in China be done.

And I don't mean you have to pay taxes, I mean you have to do ALL your business through a chinese company, directly controlled by their government.

That means, you are ACTIVELY doing business with a government that is committing a genocide on it's own people and harvesting their organs for profit.
I doubt we see anything. Things will go on as usual. The issue here is that Blizzard acted out in favor of China. Doubt we see this happen much more.
Big if true
Part of the agreement is that anyone on blizzard related reports team cant have *im paraphrasing here* opinions that negatively impact blizzard
It really terrifies me that people as clueless and passionate as you exist.  The casters were fired because they literally told him to do the thing that is explicitly against the terms and rules of the show.  Namely, this: “engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.”

As they literally said, right before cutting the stream "say the 8 words and we'll end after."

Honestly I hate that I have to argue with people who don't bother learning the facts and use their emotions to argue, while citing completely irrelevant laws and thinking they know wtf they are talking about.
No
Don't you think there's a problem with an economic system that rewards companies that make decisions that are morally wrong, so long as they stand to make money? There's no law of nature that exists that says blizzard had to do what they did. They did it because they wanted the money.
How can it be fixed? Why haven't we fixed it?

And yes I know. Any attempt to threaten capital power will be met with brutal violence from the ruling class as it always has been.
[deleted]
How could you setup a communist regime without an authoritarian government?

Communism requires absolute commitment from all of it's citizens.

That's why I personally view communism and authoritarianism as two sides of the same coin.

I get that communism has nothing to do with it on its own, but in reality, the two go hand in hand.
That's actually a surprisingly difficult question, but https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5rloof/what_is_fascism_what_beliefs_does_it_entail/ is a good explanation.
The term "socialist" was added as lip service to appeal the party to workers.
They called themselves socialist to appeal to the socialists, then murdered all the socialists.
They didn't make all industry public, and they literally killed all the socialists. 

What the fuck do you think "First they came for the socialists," means?
The Nazis who murdered all the socialists and communists?

"First they came for the socialists" not bringing any bells?

Kinda sad that you have already forgotten the victims of the holocaust.
They didn't make industry public, where the shit did you get that idea?
you're despicable, anyone who defends Nazis should go have a closer look at themselves, troll or not
Funny how no one but fascists say that when one points out Nazis weren't socialists hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
Is it really the no true Scotsman fallacy? According to the above commenter it's by definition not communism.
Yes it can. 

If you reallocate all shares of a corporation to the workers or local community or municipiality, it doesn't suddenly mean you end market economics. 

It would just mean some things such as Property cease to be commodified. Not everything in market economy has to be a commodity. I mean, I think we decided that humans are commodities a while ago.

Yes, under communism market economics would not work because there is no money and the unions and communities would theoretically work together to determine what is needed and how and blah blah blah who cares. But there are more systems than just full on communism and capitalism now are there?
There was no research at all. A bit of nuance in that he presented the historic progression of the CCP but his conclusion is faulty because he falsely claims that market economics is distinct from private ownership.
It is a good example of state capitalism because that’s what it was and as I said they had no idea qualms about killing socialists and communists. If you want a more recent example the military industrial complex is another state capitalist venture since it is government contracts that are exempt from typical regulations and competition of the market.
They have a [higher life expectancy](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-is-us-life-expectancy-so-low) than the US despite being under an economic siege state for over 50 years.

They provide more medical workers the developing world than [all G8 countries combined](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_medical_internationalism). Compared to capitalist countries in the same region like Haiti, the Dominican Republic, and Belize that’s really impressive.
Your question is vague. Mind elaborating on what exactly you're trying to determine?
And?  That’s still capitalism, regardless of what they say.  That they make demands of companies that otherwise in a capitalist manner doesn’t make them not capitalist.
If people can control means of production and can acquire and keep self-made wealth, what system IS that?
You’re confusing [Authoritarianism ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarianism) with [Communism](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism)

Those aren’t synonymous, despite what American propaganda tells you

China is [Authoritarian Capitalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authoritarian_capitalism) (well, more [State Capitalist](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_capitalism) really)

Don’t get me wrong I’m a social democrat. Capitalism needs to work for the people rather than just a few.
ImAgInE bEiNg So InSaNe ThAt YoU tHiNk CaPiTaLiSm Is A gOoD tHiNg. MaN tHaT’s aLwAyS wHaT gEtD.

This is how you read. Also you apparently had a stroke at the end there.
Oh so standing up against China's behavior is now just a "political statement"? Doesn't Blizzards decision affirm and give even more power to China's censorship? I thought you hated that? 

Also, companies can make plenty of money outside of China. You honestly think they'd go bankrupt? The fact is, they can make MORE money in China, so they'll do China's bidding in order to have access to that.
Why should a very small amount of people control the fates of so many others? Is that your ideal society?
No, he's saying the problem is inherent to the machine (capitalism) because even if it seems possible to have a "moral" company when you look at the company level, a finer grain analysis reveals that such a situation is not stable.

Take the nice little happy company that was exampled. It looks nice and a way to solve the moral issues of capitalism, but then you look at it and realize that they will be unable to pay their workers as much as a competitor who **is** aggressively pursuing growth.

I'm not saying that every worker will quit and join the competitor. It's enough for there to merely exist an incentive for the workers to quit.
I'm not sure how you took away that nugget of wisdom from what I said, but alrighty. I was just answering the previous person's comment of them asking if it is a bad thing to not have growth in the company. 

&#x200B;

If you think that this is a part of the problem your probably right. In a sense, we're all a part of the problem :o
Who knows what they were talking about. A they could be a communist shill. Or not. We have to be careful about the assumptions we make online. Perhaps we could be having a productive discussion instead of this one.
Are you sure? Autumn mentioned the shareholder system and constant economic growth, to which you replied "then I guess it's not a capitalism problem" (paraphrased). 

Or did I not read that correctly?

Did you not mean to imply that those were not critical aspects of capitalism?
Right, it's much easier to do when you're wealthy, and that wealth translates into power. Which economic system makes it very easy for people to do that?
Do you understand the science of climate change? Or more plainly, do you believe in climate change caused by human activity?
There are tons of companies headquartered in the US that manufacture or distribute their products from China because they didn’t care about their workers enough to pay them living wages to the point that they’d rather pay pennies for foreign labor. The CCP sold out their own labor force to foreign capital in order to build their own manufacturing and to spite the Soviets.
Bruh you think China is communist in 2019? Please read a book
I disagree, I think that any action taken would have been met with a public response; and i'm confident that even if they only merely banned the player, the public would say they were going to far; granted I will give you that I think fewer players would have been as outspoken; but what of the Chinese market? What if Blizzard games were banned in china, and people lost their jobs as a result? At the end of the day, I think Blizzard did the right thing.
Your duty? Seems a bit delusional, but w/e. Have fun; i'm gonna go play overwatch.
My original point was that Blizzard shouldn't have had to make a choice in the first place. None of this would have happened if the player had not wrongly used their game as his vehicle for political expression. For that, he got what he deserved.
Chinese overlords... This guy....

The reason i'm making a comparison is to show you a different perspective. Its easy for you to say that what Blizz did was wrong, having no stake in the company one way or another. Its easy to make broad statements like "Blizz is trying to please their chinese overlords" because thats what the small minded do. Its much more difficult to actually view things from two sides and actually make an informed opinion. 

TL:DR; If Blizz is trying to appease the 'chinese overlord', you're trying to fit in with the sheep.
Despite the fury that comes from debates and arguments; I want you to know that im sad that you are sad. I get where you are coming from; and I understand why you want people who are an inspiration to others to have their own thoughts and opinions. The thing that makes that tricky is the platform that gives them a voice comes under scrutiny when they do. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few. In this case, there are many players, many employees, all of which come under fire when the thoughts and opinions of one person influence all.
I don't believe in metaphors? The hell is that supposed to mean?
I'm not addicted to WoW. I enjoy the game lol
Care to link were blizzard say the support that. Because I know you can't lol
[deleted]
Don't watch fox. Didn't just bring up one thing, although one of those things I did bring up (ending endless wars of 20 years) is kinda a big deal and has saved likely hundreds of thousands of lives but yeah, NBD right? And I could bring up a lot more but that's not really the point of the conversation is it? 

Also just saying that he asked a foreign government to interfere with an election repeatedly doesn't make it true. Joe Biden was selling influence and his son Hunter was definitely under investigation by the Ukrainian Government and The Vice President at the time without question used his power and tax payer money to extort the Ukrainian Government to force them to fire that prosecutor and drop the investigation into Burisma. None of these facts are in dispute. The only one is whether Joe was actually selling influence but I defy anyone to come up with a reason why a completely inexperienced person with no background in oil and natural gas who doesn't speak the Ukrainian language who just so happened to be the son of the vice president was the best person for the job outside of influence peddling.

Asking for that to be looked into without the slightest hint of pressure from Trump isn't election interference, it is just common sense. Especially when Joe Biden straight up says this: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UXA--dj2-CY

(addendum: Don't use Google, they bury this simple link to a direct quote and delete the video whenever they find it apparently, I had to repeatedly look it up with direct keywords a few times and mostly got News organizations telling me this never happened but here it is. Foreign interference my ass, Corporate interference seems the most malicious.
What does that mean
People that believe hongkong is not a part of China
He said Hong Kong does not have anything to do with China anymore, how do I supposed to know what he meant lmao
Not my worst fap
> bring up a political statement which has nothing to today in a video game industry.

Except clearly China's attempts to dictate any and all content with threats of financial destruction demonstrates that it is a political statement relevant to today in the video game industry.
>but the interviewers is leading Blitzchung to bring up a political statement which has nothing to today in a video game industry.

Day to day politics ? Sure, probably nothing to do in a video game industry, at least not in a tournament. But we are talking about human rights, here. I would say, any media can be used to fight for your rights and freedom, and the video game industry is one of them.
Can you show me exactly where they did that? Or provide transcripts. Seeing their reaction to what blitzchung said I don't believe you
Nice mental gymnastics
How can you be killed by the ability to own property and do as you wish with it?
They already booked Stockholm for their next. This also was the first TI in China, a country from where 1/3 of TI winners come from, and have a massive playerbase. China doesn't seem like a hill Valve wants to die on, if they can avoid it.
What? First off this is a hypothetical situation I commented on, Blizzard haven't fired anyone related to Mei lol. All I was saying is, if Valve were going to stand in solidarity with the HK protests this wouldn't be their move, they would have announced an indefinite freeze of their servers and services in the Chinese market and issued a statement saying they have no interest in doing business with the Chinese government, which they currently do. 

All I was saying is them wanting to do business in China doesn't inherently make them pro CCP, but being realistic Valve would likely try to avoid getting mixed into this. Radio silence is kinda a classic Valve move
I live in America and pay taxes to the government but I am not a pro-Trump Administration citizen. Valve sought to expand their business, and wanted to reach the Chinese markets. So yes, they had to deal with the Chinese government, and they did. That does not make Valve inherently pro CCP, it at worst makes them pro business over human rights. Not a good thing, sure, but that doesn't mean they support the CCP politics, actions, and gross violations. Not to mention, cancelled relations with the CCP wouldn't really do much except cut Valve's services off from the Chinese population. 

I am not suggesting any of this is okay. In a perfect world yes, Valve would issue a statement condemning the CCP and declaring an indefinite freeze of their business relations in solidarity with the HK protests. They would partner with various development studios for some sort of sale where % of profits go to support groups aiding the HK situation. It would be awesome, and a huge PR boost for Valve, globally. 

But it would also mean unless the entire structure over there changes and foreign businesses become able to do business without going through a governing body, Valve would very likely be forever barred from operating in China, which would be a huge blow. Especially as their competition such as Epic would surely step in and fill the void, actually shaking Valve's iron grip on the PC video game marketplace. Again, it would be awesome if Valve did it, but the reality is you are looking at it in a very black and white lens when it is all a very messy and far less straight forward situation.
a pro player was banned in china because of racial slur. Valve didn't lay a hand on the player but let the org to punish their own player. As mostly valve is hands off on everything as long as they can avoid any.
Voluminous if veracious.

You really should.
The economic system isn't coercing them, how does that even make sense? Instead of dealing with the real problem, you seem to be content chasing ghosts that you'll never catch. Once again, I would like to be clear in saying, had it not been for the authoritarian Chinese government, not only would Blizzard be able to make a morally sound decision, but, THERE WOULDN'T EVEN BE A DECISION. This all started because Blitzchung wanted to speak out about the HK protests and the violence being perpetrated by the government. If China was not so obsessed with absolute control over the citizens, to the point that they are brutalizing citizens en masse, then Blitzchung would've just played, he would've won, done a normal interview, and gone home. The problem starts with China.
Or we pressure Blizzard into reversing their stance on political speech via publicity, boycotts, etc? Good gracious, you just can't see a solution to ANY problem that does not include ending capitalism, can you?
Catalonia in the '30s, the Rojava territories, and the Zapatista controlled territory aren't very authoritarian. At least to my understanding of them.
I try to steer clear of talking in absolutes.

There have been democratic communist governments, not of entire countries but certainly cities.
There have been communist communes that existed free of any larger national control, just not really in the modern era.
>*Capitalism* requires absolute commitment from all of it's citizens.

It doesn't, and nor does communism.
Thank you for that!

Ah right, despite me being anti-authoritarian in all its forms I *MUST* be a fascist because I *disagree with you*. The beef I have with communism is that it inevitably leads down the road of totalitarianism. We've done this experiment over and over again, the results always come out the same.
You can't define a movement out of responsibility. If every movement that calls itself communist ends up (when it finally accrues the power to do so) creating a totalitarian system where the government owns the means of production, then that's what communism is *in reality*, rather than what they prefer to define themselves as.
Shares are reallocated to the workers, ok, that’s just wealth redistribution. Not public ownership. The capital will flow and eventually reconcentrate as workers sell shares to buy houses, cars, pay for kids, etc 

I suppose you could theoretically have a market economy where profit is taxed 100% and redistributed back to everyone. I suspect this would not be a very efficient economy however as productivity would surely suffer with no reward for labor. 

It’s true that there are more systems than just communism and capitalism. They’re both ideal economic systems, neither exists in a pure form anywhere. I’d say China falls more closely under “communism” than “capitalism” however because even though there is the impression of a “free market” it’s really just a “state-sponsored market” with the dressings of freedom. 

Many of the dominant companies in China are state-sponsored. Even though their share of overall GDP has declined, the effect is such that even the new private companies would still be somewhat beholden to the state as they are competing with state-sponsored companies and their investment money comes from people and organizations with state ties.
Except the US military industrial complex isn't state capitalism. To expand on your example Lockheed Martin still competes with Boeing who still compete with McDonnell Douglas to sell the US government military planes. The state buys from whichever company provides the best bid but the state doesn't own the companies and all of them are subject to competition from each other.
Did I miss the part in your link where they actually provide the life expectancy of Cubans? I'm not seeing in the article or the pdf linked in it. A quick search has Cuba at [78.7 years](https://www.bing.com/search?q=Cuba+life+expectancy&qs=n&form=QBLH&sp=-1&pq=cuba+life+expectancy&sc=5-20&sk=&cvid=74A629DA5D7542C082CA5C2C25D441EF), so would be 0.1 years more than your article's value for Americans. So pretty much no benefit seen

What's more, obesity and healthcare in general in the US is known to be total dogshit compared to many other western nations, so comparing to them is pretty disingenuous, when you have most other locations between 81 and 83 years, per your article's pdf
They're not capitalist tho, they own and indirectly own almost all the major industries in China. That's communism. Additionally, they call themselves communist. 

This is a classic example of "This country makes my political idealogy look bad so it is actually capitalism".

Before it was Venezuela, now it's China
No I'm on mobile and clicked the post button before I was done, I've edited it. You're surely a stable person. Seek help.
A communist dictatorship forces a company to censor its audience and your thought process is "evil capitalists"? Brilliant analysis dude, well done. /golfclap

And I didn't say they would go bankrupt but people would absolutely lose their jobs, Blizzard's leaders have more responsibility to their employees than they do a political movement, even if I agree with said movement.
Right because that's not the end result in every country where communism has been tried and failed miserably?

The thing is is that that money always goes to the bosses and higher ups and never to the people who are causing the company to grow.
Just slipping back in to the say the business is over 50 years old. Maybe we are an anomaly... but more likely I think people hear about and focus on the excesses of capitalism, rather than the stable workhorses.

You go ahead and have your deep conversation with a communist that only sees the faults in capitalism and not in humanity itself. I’ll go ahead and not waste my time.

Democratic socialism is capitalism, not communism. At least learn your terminology if you want to act like you care about discussing the issue.
Scroll up in the comment chain dude. The structure of capitalism isn't relevant to my point.
I have not done any research into that particular topic and cannot say with certainty whether or not I believe in man-made climate change.
I believe in climate changed caused by China, India, and the majority of South East Asia because they're the ones doing the most damage to the planet by far. I hate this idea that all countries should be held equally accountable when it's very clearly not true.

Think for yourself, BRUH
> I disagree, I think that any action taken would have been met with a public response

Not to this extent though, and that is the point.
Yes it's our duty to tell people in power in the media that we don't want them taking orders from the CCP because if we don't, they have no reason not to and the CCP gets control over all media worldwide. CCP's power lies in the government. In the west we have to rely on the power of the people. If we abandon that we have nothing.
As did Blizzard.
Yeah thats what im doing.  Anyone who has a common opinion is one of the ShEePLe.  If you want to tell yourself they didnt have a choice, you keep defending blizzard with make believe comparisons and keep playing world of warcraft or whatever.  They obviously had a choice. Blizzard chose to side with an oppressive goverment over a gamer's free speech, and theyre experiencing the backlash for it.  Thats literally all there is to it.
Bet.

Calm down there incel. Your names Disney. A company who bows to china and you call me a troll lol
Mei is a video game character and her lore doesn’t apply irl. Only what she stands for. “Our world is worth fighting for”
But their reactions only support this point of view. They knew what he is going to say and hid behind the monitors like idiots. Moreover, they could know it only because they just said "say 8 words"
When resources are distributed so people don't have what they need to live, the ideology at fault is capitalism. Every single American who died as a result of lack of access to healthcare was killed by capitalism. Every American killed by smog or poor air quality because companies would lose profits for cleaning their own messes was killed by capitalism. Every person killed in a conflict sparked by a capitalist country because its corporations wanted some resource in that country (banana republics) was killed by capitalism.

Capitalism doesn't know what externalities are. It doesn't account for damage caused secondarily to the operation of a business, and it is uniquely prone to regulatory capture and corruption of higher government functions. Socialized democracies don't have those problems because a strong central government regulates away capitalist excesses and forces capitalists to care about externalities.
I didn't say it was actually happening, I just don't get why the general idea is that any other company would have bitten the pillow too. We're seeing the opposite with EPIC and etc vocally coming out now, it seems exculpatory to suggest that because it's a region of growth that it would inhibit companies from doing the right thing - especially since we are seeing them literally come out to do the right thing. It's more of a general question to an opinion a lot of people hold instead of a direct expectation for you to explain yourself.
Trying to appeal to Valve's profit margins ain't going anywhere with me. It's not like they're spending the ludicrous amount they make anyway, all they sell is other people's games and hats for games they made 5+ years ago.

If your business requires you to work directly with genocidal dictatorships to stay afloat, your business is bad for humanity, and doesn't deserve defending.
So your argument is that before they ducked their heads to hide and told him to say the 8 words that they would not talk about after and would immediately cut the stream, that they were unaware of what was about to happen, oh ok
Literally in your link -  'Though Blizzard has deleted the stream, a clip of the exchange is being shared online. Moments before Chung speaks, Virtual confirmed to me that he said something along the lines of, "OK, so after you've said your eight words, we'll end our conversation with that. We won't discuss anything more after that. You can start whenever. First, let's bow our heads." '

The only thing he was 'unaware' of was that he was going to be doing the interview in the gas mask and goggles. Once they saw him with that on, they knew what was going to happen and told him to say the words and they would cut the stream. You can be accused of ignorance if you wont even read your own article that you link as a source for your argument.
I’m not saying they’re not bending a knee to the central government in China. I’m saying they shouldn’t. Clearly they want money more than they care about anything else.
> “engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.”
You do realize political affiliation is NOT a protected class, right?  You keep saying "you're not allowed" and that's empirically false, you most certainly are (depending on state).  It's not a federal law.
No.
Yeah and if atoms never condensed into planets and stars we wouldn't be here. You're acting like blizzard had no choice. They made their choice on purpose. Corporations constantly choose profit over people and over morality. 

Why do you refuse to acknowledge that Blizzard has any responsibility for its own decision making?
Sure I can. Just not problems that have pursuit of profit at their core. Why would I not address the root issue?
Only a sith deals in absolutes
You can’t choose not to interact with capitalism and stay alive in modern America. Capitalism isn’t voluntary
Just because thats what they called themselves, doesnt make it an accurate term.
Ah yes, just as the Democratic Republic of Korea is a model country for all democracies to follow.
You're wrong.

The fact is they mislabeled themselves, on purpose, because the moniker of socialist was attractive to people. They were lying.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_Nazi_Germany#Privatization_and_business_ties
Not sure what you mean by "nationalized all industry".  Got a source?
I never accused you, calm down. Just pointing out a stupid thing I noticed. Hell, I could expand it to include more groups.

I'm also not a communist and I agree that it so easily turns into an authoritarian nightmare.

I'm just annoyed with the whole "no true communism" thing because it kinda ignores what communism is supposed to be. You cant just call yourself communist and then go and do things that aren't communist.

Yes, it does turn authoritarian. It is at its core a revolutionary ideology that considers anyone who disagrees an enemy and that rarely attracts people who are good at knowing when to stop or goes very well.
This is the best and most concise answer I have heard for the whole "no true communism" argument. This exactly, if every single country that has tried it has ended up the same way, maybe the problem is the system not the people.
Never thought about it like that. However would that mean that communism itself is a totalitarian system or just that it is completely impossible to implement 'true' communism without creating such a system, rendering 'true' communism something that just can't exist?
> Shares are reallocated to the workers, ok, that’s just wealth redistribution. Not public ownership. The capital will flow and eventually reconcentrate as workers sell shares to buy houses, cars, pay for kids, etc

That is if you commodify it.

Again, market economics does not mean every little thing is a commodity that can be bought or sold. Being a worker means you have ownership. You didn't buy it, you got it by being a worker.

> I suppose you could theoretically have a market economy where profit is taxed 100% and redistributed back to everyone. I suspect this would not be a very efficient economy however as productivity would surely suffer with no reward for labor.

That isn't anything like what I have said. Also did you forget wages exist?

> It’s true that there are more systems than just communism and capitalism. They’re both ideal economic systems, neither exists in a pure form anywhere. I’d say China falls more closely under “communism” than “capitalism” however because even though there is the impression of a “free market” it’s really just a “state-sponsored market” with the dressings of freedom.

Capitalism != market economics

Nor is communism the lack of it.

Market economics just means that value of goods and services is based on supply and demand for that good or service, not some central authority (such as the state).

And its state capitalism because the state owns the Property and Means of production (though its more of a hybrid now, as they allow private ownership in some regions with state approval).
That just further proves my point, Cuba, a Caribbean island nation that has been subjugated to embargos, sanctions, coup attempts, assassination and [terrorist](https://owlcation.com/humanities/Operation-Northwoods-US-False-Flag-Attacks-to-Invade-Cuba-in-1962) plots by the most powerful government on Earth, STILL can pull off a better healthcare program for itself and export it to poor countries, than the US. 

Compared to their Latin American neighbors they are anywhere between 4-10 years higher in life expectancy. You’re trying to compare them to countries who are allowed to freely trade with the rest of the world and have guarantees by the US that they won’t invade them.
You clearly didn’t read the State Capitalist link and then made bad statements with nothing backing them up.

I guess you would also argue that North Korea is Democratic because the official name of the country is the “Democratic People’s Republic of Korea”

I also suggest you read into the interactions between Venezuela and the US since the 1970s before using them in any argument.
>You can't define a movement out of responsibility.

You gotta take your own advice before telling others what to do there bruh

Maybe also read a book or two to get those reading comprehension and critical thinking skills up too while you’re getting help.
How did China force Blizzard? Can you please explain?
This is not always the case. It does happen alot, but that doesn't mean it happens everywhere. People like to focus on the negatives, but they don't talk about the positives as much. A company that gives them amazing benefits or vacation time, like MongoDB or Rubicon, doesn't get as much publicity as the company that is known for poor work conditions (ie. Walmart). 

&#x200B;

There is always the option of starting your own business as well. Not always the first choice for people, but it is an option!
Okay let's break it down further. Sometimes companies pollute the land or water with waste. Even though they're fully aware that it will negatively affect the environment, and the people surrounding it, they do it. 

Why do you think that is?
Facts dont care about your ignorance
"It's totally okay that "western" societies spent the last two hundred years destroying the planet in a race to industrialize, but if anyone else wants to do it, they are specifically bad and evil."

Did I get that right? 

Why do you let some people off the hook just because you happen to live on the same continent has them?
Sadly its not quite as easy to point fingers as that, climate change is (as far as science is convinced) caused by greenhouse gas emissions, and [this graph](https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/images/2019/09/2016%20Country%20Emissions%20Percentages%20GTC02_0.jpg) shows the 2016 (most recent that I could find) data for greenhouse gas emissions per country, the graph was sourced from [this website.](https://www.ucsusa.org/global-warming/science-and-impacts/science/each-countrys-share-of-co2.html)

The graph lists the US as the second largest producer of greenhouse gases, with India coming in 3rd.

Even if you go by per capita, (located in the lower portion of the same website) the US is 3rd.

Climate change is a problem as you've said, but the facts indicate that its being caused by China, America, and India in that order. The "Majority of South East Asia" (Here I'm excluding India and China as they're listed above) comes in at under 8%, similar to the US.

Honestly China is the one that needs to change the most, that much is clear, but the US needs to accept it could stand to clean up its act too.
We need to set an example prior to policing them.
1.	It’s not the case that all movements that self describe as socialist or communist become totalitarian. You just uncritically believe vestigial Cold War propaganda apparently.
2.	China is simply not communist under anybody’s definition of the word. You could debate about their adherence to communist principles under Mao, but after Deng Xiaoping there is no case whatsoever to be made that China is communist.

Stop talking about things you have precisely zero understanding of and do some reading.
There are so many sides to look at this though. Maybe they could have dealt a lighter sentence, but that raises other questions:

- Would a lighter sentence deter future pro players from doing the same?
- Would a lighter sentence have garnered a different reaction from other markets (obviously) most notably the Chinese market?

At the end of the day they made an example of this guy so this thing wouldn't happen again on their platform, or during related events. Americans are opinionated, but very lazy, its doubtful that the negative press they are receiving now will matter in the long run. That was likely their primary motivating factor for making the decision they made.
I believe in capitalism, so yes, if you don't want to purchase blizzard products because of some misguided ideology, hey; more power to you.

But I think this is much bigger than that. This is a bunch of virtue signaling SJW's band-wagon'ing and witch hunting a company in order to feel more holier than thou art.
Where does blizzard say they support it. Not blizzard protecting their product.

> Every single American who died as a result of lack of access to healthcare was killed by capitalism.

No, they were killed by whatever condition they had.  Healthcare in America is extremely regulated and heavily subsidized, and when that centrally-planned system fails, you go around and blame capitalism?

>Every American killed by smog or poor air quality because companies would lose profits for cleaning their own messes was killed by capitalism.

Collectively-owned factories don’t pollute? TIL

> Every person killed in a conflict sparked by a capitalist country because its corporations wanted some resource in that country (banana republics) was killed by capitalism.

And here is where you lost me? How are actions of the State, the sole largest violator of private property, in any way shape or form “capitalism”? The government sustains itself through violence and theft, not voluntary transactions respecting private property. And any collectivization of the means of production will only give these bastards MORE power,  not less.

> Capitalism doesn't know what externalities are.

Only people can know things.

> it is uniquely prone to regulatory capture

Are you arguing that regulations of the market are a bad thing? Congratulations, you are a capitalist. Or are you iust arguing against democracy?

> Socialized democracies don't have those problems because a strong central government regulates away capitalist excesses and forces capitalists to care about externalities.

If laws exist that affect the economy, it becomes a viable strategy to pay regulators to enact them in a way so as to stop your competitors. If you can’t invest resources to do that, you are forced to just make better products instead. But as long as there is democracy, campaigns will need to be financed and companies WILL find a way to meddle.

What is a socialized democracy anyway? Socialism is the collective ownership of the means of production. That can only be attained through violence and slavery, so you don’t really have ANY examples of a socialist country that is a democracy. You don’t mean the nordic countries, do you? Cause they are [NOT socialist](https://www.google.com.br/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreydorfman/2018/07/08/sorry-bernie-bros-but-nordic-countries-are-not-socialist/amp/). Also, being heavily regulated will make an area good, huh? Ask the American Healthcare system.
Well I was specifically commenting on Valve due to their situation. This thread was started because someone made a joke about how Valve would hire people Blizzard fires in relation to this, and someone replied suggesting they would probable cave just like Blizzard is, which was then contested. 

Valve specifically have a *lot* of investments into the Chinese market now, mostly in relation to Perfect World a Chinese company. Valve has sunk a ton of time and money into expanding into China, same with Blizzard, so it makes sense from a business standpoint that these companies wouldn't want to rock the bed so to speak. Blizzard more so, with direct ownership ties to Tencent. But Valve would certainly not try to stand out in solidarity with the protests unless they were sure it would not harm their business ventures in China. 

Epic on the other hand doesn't have nearly as much invested in China. Valve sort of muscled them out in a way, so it makes sense they feel free to stand out against the CCP as they have far less to lose. Sometimes a company will act on the side of morality even if it means a blow to their business. All I was commenting on is that Valve is very likely not one of those companies, at least not in this situation.
Valve already banned a player from attending a dota major in China, because the government of the city it was held in didn't want him there.

Granted the player most likely wouldn't have even been given a visa.
Lol okay. I really don't think there's anything left to be said here. You are reading my words in your own voice and misconstruing what I say.

I said very very clearly the fact that Valve does business with the CCP and is not cutting it off in light of the HK protests is not okay. I am simply explaining to you why it makes sense from a critical standpoint. 

I can understand perfectly why someone does something even if I disagree with it wholeheartedly. And I don't think anyone has tried defending Valve or any company for that matter who have acted, or rather not acted, during all of this. 

Also to be clear Valve in no way needs the China market to stay afloat lmfao. They are simply expanding there for the sake of continuous growth and to avoid stagnation as they already dominate the western markets. **Again, I am not defending it, I am simply explaining it.**
I think you should take advice from your own Username bud
Thank you for this lovely false dichotomy, strawman argument. 

While it would be nice to believe that Valve could just ignore China, they have to respond to China's heavy investment in the industry, including significant investment into the Epic launcher, which is the first real competition Steam has had since its inception. The current market presence will only insulate them and keep them afloat so long if their direct competition has an extra billion potential customers. Either they comply with the requirements to sell in China, or they eventually lose money. There might be ways around it, if you look hard enough, but that requires lots of other things to work out ok. No matter how big they look, there is only so much they can take and stay afloat

Then let's see how much a bunch of Republicans bitch when they get fired.
More demonstration of your emanant cleverness?
Way to strawman my argument instead of acknowledging any of the various truths i stated about China. You seem to be so against Blizzards choice of profit over human rights, but what about China? They don't even choose profit, they choose power over human rights. Fundamentally worse because they're trying to control the people directly rather than the peoples money, do you get it? Censorship on the scale that China perpetrates it is no longer what i would consider censorship. It's thought policing. 

Why do you refuse to acknowledge that China is the perpetrator of one of the largest humanitarian crises in recent history. I mean come on, they're hiring triad gangs in HK to attack the protesters, this is actual evil you're defending just so you can take a stab at capitalism, but it isn't even remotely justified.
The profit motive isn't necessarily bad. It's a powerful motive. We just need to make sure that we reign it in, for example when it's used to silence political speech.

If we lived in an older house, and every time there was a problem with the plumbing or something, you suggest fixing the problem and I suggest tearing down the entire house and starting over, who would have the more reasonable response in that situation?
"Interacting" and "absolute commitment" are not the same.

I interact with capitalism but I'm not remotely committed to it.
> You cant just call yourself communist and then go and do things that aren't communist.

I would agree, considering a similar thing happens with the word "liberal" and I can go into great detail as to how that term is being misused. But unlike communism liberalism has a long history of proper use, whereas communism always seems to turn to authoritarianism as soon as it acquires the power to do so.

Edit: I would liken it to "dictator", it didn't originally have the negative connotations it does now, it's the history of the abuse of the position that put those connotations there.
"True" communism can exist (after a fashion) on very small scales (small enough that the majority of people know the majority of other people). It is the inherent anonymity that comes with large populations that causes communism to crumble (people are less willing to work for the benefit of people they don't know, and those who cheat the system are more likely to get away with it).

The only method yet devised to compensate for this is a central authoritarian government, without which the system collapses.
>That isn't anything like what I have said. Also did you forget wages exist?

I was trying to come up with something like what you were imagining: a market economy with "means of production" owned by the public

Yes, I know of wages. That is exactly what is mentioned in what you quoted from me. A wage, distributed via profit taxation from the state. This would allow for private enterprise to run, but all profit would be redistributed. This is effectively a market economy, but public owned "means of production".

>That is if you commodify it.
>Again, market economics does not mean every little thing is a commodity that can be bought or sold. Being a worker means you have ownership. You didn't buy it, you got it by being a worker.

Now you're just using words with no substance. "Commodify"? It's a share of a company. It has value. That is the only reason it exists, is as proxy for value of a company. If you can't sell a share, it is literally a meaningless proposition. If workers receive "shares" for working, they better be able to sell them or you're giving them a useless piece of paper. "Shares" don't entitle you to profits through ownership, but through speculative appreciation in the value of the company.

>Nor is communism the lack of it.
>Market economics just means that value of goods and services is based on supply and demand for that good or service, not some central authority (such as the state).

Communism is **defined** by central authority. "Public ownership" is tantamount to "state ownership".
You are truly brainwashed if you think that Cuba is providing more medical services to 3rd world countries than the US, there may be a  larger # of private citizens involved but being from Cuba and working in the medical industry in another country is nowhere in the same ballpark as the medical relief that the US provides free of charge to other countries.
Okay so they are state capitalist in terms of their economy, but more communist in their "social scores", dictatorship, censorship etc.


With venezuela, their relatively thriving economy very quickly went to shit after electing their socialist dictator. Are you really going to blame the US? Can you be a more stereotypical "fuck america, communism is actually not that bad" lefty.
Unironically condemns capitalism and defends communism, accuses another person of being poorly educated.

Man I'll give you this, haven't laughed this hard in a while. Now go tell mommy you need the newest iPhone and 30 bucks to go to Starbucks while you stick it to us capitalist swine.
In the only way that a government can with a foreign company, disallow them to operate in their market.

Doesn't matter, you're not going to win with this line of logic because the only institution with the power to coerce the other is the COMMUNIST CHINESE PARTY you CANNOT spin this to be the fault of capitalism.
Dude, they're a T_D user.

What you're doing is like trying to talk to a deaf person over the phone.
This is what regulations are supposed to be for. Unfortunately, nothing is perfect and it takes time (and usually public outcry following an event that brings it to attention, which is then followed by extensive studies to conclusively prove the problem needs regulating) to recognize problems in need of regulation and then to implement said regulations.
Nobody is being let off the hook but when those areas he named are creating 75% of the pollution and you look at a country that is creating 5% and tell them they are the main source of the problem, you look like an idiot.
Well considering we can't change the past two hundred years without a time machine, why should we dwell on it instead of trying to change the present and the future? Maybe you need to work on your obsession with the past and focus more on who's doing what *today.*
China is actually one of the countries that put the most effort into reducing their emissions. Especially in the big cities where they heavily limit people's ability to drive cars. They rank as the 12th largest emitter by capita (when only counting the 20 most emitting countries) (3 times lower than the US, Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia) despite being the manufacturing capital of the world and their emission rates are constantly dropping since 2013.

They only rank that high because of their insanely large population and manufacturing industry. In particular the emissions caused by manufacturing should be spread across all countries importing goods from them, because if they weren't manufactured in China, they would still be manufactured. Just somewhere else.
> At the end of the day they made an example of this guy so this thing wouldn't happen again on their platform, or during related events.

Yes, and in doing so they have basically made a political statement.
This doesn't have anything to do with social justice or left-right ideology. It's about westerners not wanting western media companies to be controlled by the CCP.
Right, your IQ is probably not enough to read properly, my apologies.
"Meanwhile, we will, as always, be determined to defend the pride of the country (China)". Y'know. The same country governed by, ah, say, a communist regime who made organ harvesting legal.
Translation:

"My translation: *we would like to* ***express our ‘strong anger and condemnation’*** *at what happened at the Hearthstone Asia Tournament last weekend. We also* ***strongly object to the spreading of personal political beliefs*** *during any contests. The c****ontestant involved (Blitzchung) will be banned*** *from participating in any contests, and the* ***broadcasters involved will also be immediately stopped from working*** *(under Blizzard). Meanwhile, we will, as always, be determined to* ***defend the pride of the country (China)****.*"
You are confusing me. Do you support china? Lol Blizzard bad disney ok lol. Seriously lol
Communism is the collective ownership of the means of production. Socialism is varying degrees of government provision of goods and services. American healthcare outcomes are demonstrably the worst in the developed world in every category except 5-year survival for a few types of cancer, while also being 40% more expensive per person per year than Norway's. Every other developed country in the world has some kind of mass taxpayer-funded healthcare system which covers every citizen, even more heavily regulated private insurance than the US, or both. Locally collectively owned factories don't pollute as much because the stakeholders care about the area being polluted. Because they live there.

Capitalism, by concentrating capital with a small group of people, also concentrates power with that group. The means of production ARE the power of the state, as the state cannot exist without systems to provide goods and services. The people who hold the means of production therefore hold the power of the state. Therefore, in capitalist countries, the actions of the state are the actions of the capitalists. In social democracies, like those which exist over all of Western Europe, the power of the capitalist is tempered through taxation and the legally-enshrined right of the worker to unionize without fear of corporate retribution. This allows the economy to grow while also making sure the rest of society benefits from that growth.

You're right that the state can, and often does, use its tools to oppress and subdue. What you're wrong about is why it does so. The state cannot exist without an economic system to back it. Therefore, the state is dependent upon the economy it exists in. If the economic system it exists in is oppressive and concentrates wealth and power with very few, the state will do so as well. If it does not, it will not.

That is ultimately what happened every time communism has been tried. Not only is communism impossible at our current level of development, it is also impossible in anything less than a hyperindustrial economy. If the means of production do not exist to be siezed, the proletariat cannot sieze them. The revolutions of the 20th century were peasant revolts, and they went about as well. No matter the pretty words charismatic madmen said to bring the peasants under their banner, words don't uplift a nation.
Tencent owns 40% of Epic, but mostly I agree. I should have made a top level comment instead of responding to you, since it was a pretty general thing I was bringing up in response to something very focused.
And I'm explaining to you, that Valve's profit margins can fuck right off in the face human rights.

I understand how cancer works. Does that mean I go into every thread about cancer, and explain how cancer works to people who say "I lost my brother to cancer"? Of fucking course not.

Because *why* it killed them isn't relevant to this issue at hand. The issue is *that* it killed them.

Why Valve kisses the Chinese government's ass isn't the issue, the issue is that they're doing it at all.

And your 3 paragraph "explanation" could have been replaced with a 4 words: "Valve wants chinese money."
Thanks for letting me know you're incapable of saying anything of value.
> Either they comply with the requirements to sell in China, or they eventually lose money.

Fine.

If your business model requires you to do business with a genocidal government, your business should not exist.
I don't know what to tell you, other than that there are probably better ways to get information than to just read articles.  

Generally, I find checking the comments of Reddit helpful, and actually reading/skimming top to bottom to find the translation that you "couldn't understand", and then follow up on them.  For instance, here's [literally the most highly upvoted thread from this week](https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/devia0/blizzard_ruling_on_hk_interview_blitzchung/?st=k1jp0vcb&sh=093c0542).  You can find that tidbit of information in...... the highest comment on the page.  Perhaps you missed it.

Maybe it's an age difference, but knowing how to ask the right questions and find information is a really important skill in this day and age.  I also can't understand the language of the stream, that doesn't mean it's acceptable for me to not try to determine what was said, or why a company may have acted in a way that I would imagine is obviously wrong.

I'm sorry, but you can't make up your own reasons, and claim they are true, without evidence other than "well, it COULD be true.  That's stupid.  Very stupid.

> “engaging in any act that, in Blizzard’s sole discretion, brings you into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public, or otherwise damages Blizzard image.”

Read that again, then ask yourself, did the player commit that offense?  Did the casters assist the player and allow him to commit the offense by saying: 

"Casters: ok so if you just say the 8 words we'll stop here, enough chit Chatting for now.  Don't forget to put your head down"
Yuh
I literally agree with every criticism against China that you laid out. When did I ever say anything to the contrary? Why would you assume I support any of that? 

The topic at hand is Blizzard's decision to do what they did. You said I'm "criticizing the consequence of the issue". That's wrong. Blizzards decision is the issue we are talking about. Or at least the one I've been attempting to discuss this entire time. Blizzard made a decision. Influenced by number of factors, sure. 

What I'm asking is, why did blizzard do that? China is doing bad things. I agree. So why did blizzard do what they did?
Bad analogy. The fact is, as long as capital can be accumulated and horded, and as long as that capital correlates to power, we'll never be free of the tyranny of the few ruling the many.
well, you'll be kicked out of your house and starve if you don't, so...
Very interesting and convincing points, thanks for engaging me. What did you mean by "you can't define a movement out of responsibility"?
> Now you're just using words with no substance. "Commodify"? It's a share of a company. It has value. That is the only reason it exists, is as proxy for value of a company. If you can't sell a share, it is literally a meaningless proposition. 

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/commodify

People who own shares have voting power and are owed dividends. Its not "meaningless".

> If workers receive "shares" for working, they better be able to sell them or you're giving them a useless piece of paper.

They aren't paid in shares, they just have them. Much like how you can't sell your citizenship. You just have it when you are born in America. You can give it up if you want to be a citizen of another country, sure, but you can't sell it. And yet, despite not having a monetary value, it still has other value to having it. It allows you to work anywhere in the 50 states, it allows you to vote in national and state elections, and you get to freely use the roads, have the rights, privileges, and entitlements. But by your statement, the fact you can't sell it to someone else makes it "meaningless".

> "Shares" don't entitle you to profits through ownership, but through speculative appreciation in the value of the company.

> Communism is defined by central authority. "Public ownership" is tantamount to "state ownership".

Except, not? Have you literally not read ANYthing on communism?

And just, no, public ownership does not mean state ownership. Did you never hear about, idk, *anarchy*?
Free of charge is a good one. They should remember that when a US trained soldier fires live ammo at their next protest.

No shit that the Caribbean island country that’s been embargoed for half a century can’t compare technology wise to the world’s largest economic and military power.
You’re attributing Authoritarianism to Communism again. Both already have well established theoretical definitions and you saying one thing is “communist” does not make it so. 

Read up on [US-Venezuela relations](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States%E2%80%93Venezuela_relations) it went to shit after Madduro was democratically elected because he was socialist. Given [the extensive history of US backed regime change is South America](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change_in_Latin_America) it’s basically guaranteed that the US had a direct role in the problems in Venezuela that lead to the contemporary authoritarian (!) regime (which is indefensible). 

So the US did what China is doing to US companies but worse to Venezuela, because Venezuela had the audacity to elect a dissident to US influence in the region.

The problem here is people using Venezuela in an argument without any of the historical reasons for why it’s lead to this authoritarian regime. It’s disingenuous.
You gotta start reading those books dude. Your errant inferences of my motivations just demonstrate your poor reading comprehension skills. 

Gotta level it past 1 bruh.
But why would a company do something bad for money? Are you okay with that? Are you okay with us corporations being used as tools for authoritarian governments?
I've got time to kill.
And then those regulations are disregarded or destroyed by the next administration. Capitalism is a destructive machine, and we can't just put foam covers over the blades.
You know who those countries export to? The United States, the largest consumers on the planet. They run their businesses based on the luxurious wants of the American people, maybe if you stopped purchasing products made in China, or India they wouldn’t be polluting so hard. But wait! That means boycotting nearly every corporation in America that’s impossible to do! Wow it’s almost as if capitalism has high jacked democracy for the ultra rich.
The US is 2nd in the world for CO2 emissions
Most of the companies causing that pollution are headquartered and incorporated in the US and Europe. If those countries tried to stop them from polluting, they’d be sanctioned, smeared as needing a regime change, then would be subjected to a US backed Civil War or decades of crippling sanctions.

You mentioned accountability. So you're saying that no one should ever be held accountable for what they did in the past? Why is that?
They basically didn't have a choice. The situation demanded a response, so they responded.
But Blizzard isn't really a western company; maybe it was at one point; but given that it operates in many markets the world over, it is no longer a western company. It is a global company, and sometimes its difficult to appease everyone; something they wouldn't have had to do had the player in question, abided by the rules.
Anyone who brings up IQ isn't very smart...
That's blizzard saying keep politics out of our game. Not we support murder. So if I support american country's I'm supporting breeding terrorism by that logic lol
Yeah, I’m out. No point arguing with someone who didn’t even bother to google what Socialism means.

> 1 : any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods
>2a : a system of society or group living in which there is no private property
b : a system or condition of society in which the means of production are owned and controlled by the state
>3 : a stage of society in Marxist theory transitional between capitalism and communism and distinguished by unequal distribution of goods and pay according to work done

Socialism IS the collective ownership of the means of production. It is NOT capitalism + welfare state, or regulated capitalism, or any of that nonsense. Capitalism is the recognition of private property, socialism is its abolition (inevitably by force).

Communism, on the other hand, is the utopic end result of Socialism, when the State is no longer necessary as a manager of the means of production, and society is classless, stateless and moneyless.

Also, you downvoting me before even responding is pathetic and petty.

Good day.
I think the difference between the 5% of Blizzard owned by Tencent and the 40% of Epic is the value of those stocks. 

Epic exploded without the Chinese market, and losing it means pretty little to them. Not to mention their main element of business over there is in licensing out Unreal Engine, which afaik is something Chinese businesses need licenses for, not the other way around, so all the CCP could do in retaliation is bar those companies from doing that, which really only harms their own economy because most of Epic's profits currently are on the heels of Fortnite and the Epic Store developer contracts.

In contrast, Blizzard really struggled in the Western Market with WoW for a long time and it was the access to the Chinese Market through Tencent that gave them an insane boost, so while the 5% stake is less than the 40% of Epic, neither are majorities so end of the day it's about the pressure that can be applied. Blizzard losing the China markets is far worse for them than Epic losing it.

Also yea, I gotcha haha. I like discussing this stuff tho :p so ima keep replying to you anyways
You are very caught up in this lol, it's a hypothetical. Valve have not done anything to kiss the CCP's ass, they just having done anything to declare against it. It's an important distinction. It is still the wrong choice in the question of morality, but it's not in the same vein as Blizzard actively punishing people even just in the same interview as someone who speaks out against the CCP.
Hey, I am just pointing out your own advice. You're upset about a hypothetical situation involving a company that has nothing to do with the company that actually did this.
Ok. Then Epic wins, and majority of our gaming is controlled by China, instead of just a small portion of it. That's a nice idealistic opinion, but the consequences are worse, not better. Unless you can convince the US or EU government that the people can take the economy hit that banning Chinese corporations from operating or investing in companies (which we really should do until China provides reciprocity in allowing buisness) that approach just allows the Chinese governments effectively infinity money to automatically win.
Ahh, a refreshing voice of reason. Few and far between on reddit. Have an upvote.
The casters didn’t directly say anything unless you speak Taiwanese and would like to translate.
Edit:

The US based articles I’ve been reading make it out that Blizzard terminated their employment.
I didn't realize that *international politics* and the interests of a *hostile foreign power* as declared by the idiot in the Oval Office were included.

 Well I've already established that I'm not defending them. I think they are morally in the wrong, however I disagree with the suggestion that they're immoral because of Capitalism. They're immoral because they're human, and humans have greed. It's the same reason Communism has failed historically multiple times. Once the "Provisional Leader" is appointed, the greed of the individual takes over and the final stages never come to fruition. I think that the people behind the decisions at Blizzard are blinded by the Chinese Governments Wallet. Their options are either to lose a HUGE amount of revenue, and subsequently have all of their products banned in China, or they can do what they did. I DO NOT agree with what they did, however, greed is a powerful thing and I do not think greed is exclusive to Capitalism.
It's only a bad analogy if you think capitalism is a worse system than the alternatives. Most people disagree.
Just that. Just because a movement defines itself as [feel-good rhetoric] doesn't mean you get to ignore it when more often than not members of said group do exactly the opposite. 


This is doubly the case where motte and bailey tactics are used in defense of an ideology. For example, where the offenders are usually defended (bailey) by those who claim to be defenders of [feel-good rhetoric] until the actual topic of the inconsistency comes up, upon which they are rejected (motte) only until the topic is dropped again (return to bailey).
Dividends are not an obligation. Most companies you might invest in today do NOT pay a dividend. 

I’ll grant you that they give voting power, so maybe the workers would “elect” the leaders of their company? That could prove good, I’ll give you that. 

Anarchy is like the opposite of communism, or any system really. It is the absence of rule. Public ownership cannot exist in an anarchic society. It would be null ownership.
> Free of charge is a good one. They should remember that when a US trained soldier fires live ammo at their next protest.

great gravy that was completely unintelligible garbage, what a weak ass cheap shot lmao
So you're finally admitting that communism's false promises are the tool that enabled the authoritarian government to exist in China?
If the next administration is able to destroy regulations of importance, it is a failure of democracy, not capitalism.
You were so close to having a coherent thought!
Why are you more concerned with accountability for things we can't change than accountability for what's going on right now?
> Game Studios make games, not political statements.

They were forced to respond. They were not forced with the severity of their response. They made their choice to respond harshly to what was said, and in doing so, made a political statement.
Meanwhile, we will, as always, be determined to* ***defend the pride of the country (China)****.*


This doesn't mean "keep politics out of our game". You wrong.
Valve fired a caster, in the middle of a dota 2 tournament, at the chinese's request, 2 years ago.

They're literally the pioneers of that behavior.
Do you really not understand that Epic, Valve, Riot and all these companies doing business with genocidal governments, need to fix their shit or die?

Go away until you understand what principles are.
Thanks man.  Researching is hard work, I literally had to type my exact question in Google and not click the Ads that popped up.  Then I had to read shit :(
>The casters didn’t directly say anything unless you speak Taiwanese and would like to translate.

Lol holy shit your logic is killing me dude.  "The caster's didn't say anything!!  I mean, unless you speak Taiwanese... then I suppose they could have said something.... but I don't speak Taiwanese, so I'll just fucking assume that literally nothing of value or context could possibly be said.  I mean, who the fuck speaks Taiwanese?  Irrelevant, they must have said nothing because I didn't read anything about it and I don't know how to check the most highly upvoted thread about it from a few days ago and check the literally top comment."
"If it would have been a completely different situation, the outcome would have been different too."

Get this man a fucking Nobel Prize for his astonishing discovery.  Bravo, lad.  Bravo.  It's almost like... the severity of the action determined the consequence.  Weiiiird.  I mean, it's not like we can look to another incident like the NBA drama and figure out that pro-HK comments/statements cause potentially millions of dollars of damages and controversy from pro-China customers.  No wayyyyyyyyyyyy
Exclusive? No. But greed is absolutely encouraged and fostered and rewarded under capitalism. It sounds like you've never really read much about the rise and fall of communist societies outside of generalities and memes. I don't mean that as a dig, we live in a capitalist society so obviously that information isn't in the forefront of everyday life. 

But the simple fact is that when profit is threatened by morality, capitalism by design will choose profit. Thanks for the conversation but I'm done with this thread.

China’s has had authoritarian governments since the Han dynasty. The CCP is authoritarian because they originated as a guérilla army fighting against the dictatorship of Chiang Kai-shek and Imperial Japan. After they won they were perpetually were at risk of being invaded by the US and never completely demobilized.
Oh so you don't think that private interests and multibillion-dollar corporations have any influence on politics?
This would have been a response no matter what they did. People just need a cause to bitch about
There’s literally only a clip that has NO context left.  That’s all that exists.
Paying dividends is an option, not an obligation. 

Anarchy:
>	a state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority.

Public ownership requires recognition of authority in enforcing that ownership, even if the public itself *is* the authority.
Put down the crack pipe and back away slowly
LMAO yeah it's all the evil US's fault that China is a dictatorship rofl keep drinking that koolaide buddy
First, yes, some people complain no matter what. That doesn't take away from people making valid complaints  about a company's actions.

Also, that isnt relevant to the point you were making. Companies shouldn't be making political statements. Blizzard has, and is facing the justified consequences.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism

> even if the public itself is the authority.

Yes, that is anarchism.

Have you not heard of it before?
It’s not entirely the US’s fault but it definitely isn’t helping every time their politicians scream “regime change” start a war that kills and displaces millions of people, set up a dictatorship loyal to them then complain that the people there don’t like you. Yeah it makes some countries a little militaristic so that they can avoid turning into Iraq or Guatemala.
Free association and public ownership do not go hand in hand dude
