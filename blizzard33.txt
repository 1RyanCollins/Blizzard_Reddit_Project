I forget if it’s in the original comic, but the halo getting removed in the fourth panel is a nice touch.
No king rules forever.
Should have been OW reaper taking it away.
They sorta went full Arthas.
Metzen be like Imma dip out before this China thing blows up.
Overwatch was one of my favourite games. But the time has come until blizzard sort shit out...
Was my favorite dev when i was young. Now theyre dead to me. Rip Blizzard 1991-2008.
Even after this fiasco blizzard wasn't a good company,This time they just showed their true face when they we're pushed too far.
Tell me “friend”, when was it that Blizzard the Wise abandoned reason for madness?
If we want to really hurt blizzard, Sony and Microsoft need to join in the boycott, not allowing them to connect to their platforms.  Literally force blizzards hand in making a statement.

Edit: grammar
It’s almost 2020, what blizzard needs to realize is that consumers aren’t morons are we do care what happens with other humans

Equation equals: play another game that isn’t aligned with giving a bj to China
Good company

Chinese Government and Money ruined
Oook, but, Activision-Blizzard’s stock has dropped exactly zero points since this controversy began.


Not that the outrage isn’t meaningful; I think generating awareness, shaping public sentiment and issuing a warning cry for the inevitable future wherein we contend with this again are valuable.

But.

Activision has walked away from this essentially unscathed.

Edit: that’s it children, downvote things you dislike hearing independent of whether or not they’re on-topic contributions. No chance at all your petulance is also why Activision is going to ignore you for a week and then keep spending your wow fees.
25 years of being the best of the best, wiped away in just one year

That IS impressive
Good-bye blizzard. You have your head up your money. Pathetic.
How to win us back:

1. Reinstate Blitzchung and casters.
2. Take the financial hit with China.
3. Apologize to literally everyone and tell China to eat a dick.

Sad that probably none of these things will happen
I grow up with blizzard and it’s really sad to them go out like this. This company has no chance of redemption in my eyes.
We can't let this die. This is so much bigger. America should not bend the knee to anyone for the alrighty dollar. These corporations forgot where they came from. They have lost their way. It's up to us to regain the morals they have lost. 

Keep it up.

This is just sad.
Nice death note reference
They were good for a good while.
Twice as funny because reddit is so much better!
Blizzard, you guys can’t type tweet out an apology? Ya’ll got phones right?!??
Blizzard hasn't been a good company since they sold out to Activision.

Selling out further to China just sealed it.
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
"It's not an extradition to mainland China, it's a surprise vacation!"
Starcraft 2 is one of my favorite games I've ever played, damn shame blizzard has went this way
Damn, dude.

But at least he got his chance to wear the crown.
“You lied to your employees and betrayed the customers who paid for your products, What is happening to you, Blizzard? Is China all that’s important to you?”

Yeah, full Arthas.
"I'll take any risk to protect my investors"
I was having a similar thought the other day.  The game company that loves making good characters go bad or have tragic endings seems to be following suit.
"This entire fan base must be purged"
"You have crossed a terrible threshold, Blizzard."
"This company shall fall. And from the ashes shall arise a new greed, that will suck the very cock of China."
I had the same thoughts, that's why i made an Arthas drawing, quoting Terenas Menethil

Same here. I took a little break from it and was seriously itching to come back, ready to drop money on some fresh loot boxes. I reinstalled it the night before this started going down.

I re-uninstalled it the following morning.

I feel ya. Even though I don't spend any new money on it, I got to the title screen the other day and I just couldn't...  Going to need to find a new hero shooter
What happened in 2008?
I feel the last panel was unnecessary.
Blizzard aren’t going to make a statement. They picked their side, they’re going to stick with it. Imagine if they changed their mind and lost the Chinese market, they’d have to come back to their Western market which is currently in an uproar
I'm convinced they will never make a statement because they're so freaking arrogant and convinced they're in the right.  Look at how they defended their design decisions of the past:  no backtracking unless forced by dropping numbers and a flat, "No, you're wrong," style response.  If people aren't excited about a new thing at Blizzcon, it's because the player base is too damned stupid to know they're supposed to have phones and get behind Blizzard's vision no matter what.  It's not because they took a bad read of what the players wanted and made a mistake in pursuing it.  Of course their approach is the right one.

They're not making a statement because they're convinced their playerbase is a bunch of whiny, entitled idiots who will never leave for good, and they're able to hold up all the people still populating their servers as "proof" that they're right.  The only way Blizzard will ever backtrack from that arrogance of believing they're always right is if their games completely tank and stay empty.

And unfortunately, there are still a number of people who have so little else going on in their lives that they can't (or won't) disconnect from the game.  Each one who logs in boosts Blizzard's hubris a little bit more.

We're making a moral stand, and I think we're making a difference, but we've got years of Blizzard having an insultingly low opinion of us as disposable addicts to overcome with this before they consider us worth the effort of a press release.
Eh, I don't think unrelated corporations will get involved, nor should they.
Stocks don't move that fast....  Nothing short of an Enron scandal or global recession will cause a stock to crater within one week.

Stocks represent the best guess of the value today for all future income.

Is destiny being boycotted?  Is call of duty of being boycotted?  No?  Just the blizzard properties that are already mature and have limited room for growth?  What evidence do you have that sales are changing?

These are all things that financial pros care about, since their job is mostly math and a little bit of emotion.

Give it some time, and be sure to compare them to their competitors (if EA gains 15% and Activision gains 2%...)
You're right, a week long protest does nothing.  But if people actually stick to their guns and boycott for even 2 or 3 months, we will see some changes.  Everything is monitored, so if there is a big drop off in active players, stockholders will notice when those numbers release
This isn't even true, they are down 3.2% this week and are down 27% for the year...

What is most disheartening about all of this to me is the fact that Blizzard honestly had no say in this. Everybody has completely glossed over the fact that Blizzard literally doesn't have a CEO, as Activision did not replace Mark Morheim when he stepped down last year or so. Quite literally Activision is calling all of the shots, and they are letting the Blizzard name be tarnished while also simultaneously placing pressure on Blizzard to turn it around. It's honestly disgusting.

I've been wondering if this is a case of chinese buying up the stocks they are happy with what happened, while everyone else is upset.
It is actually up 2,72% today. So no it won't affect blizzard at all.
Too soon to say, if people actually are following through with canceling subs, it likely won't hit stocks till the next quarterly earnings report.
A lot of people probably have standing buy orders they haven't deleted, or Chinese investors could even be buying up the flagging stock to make it look like a profitable decision for Blizzard to have made.

You're right, it isn't the immediate landslide victory everyone was hoping for, but a plummet in subscriptions should still make a difference at the next annual or quarterly meeting.
Their stock wont really change until the next game comes out.
Why would their stocks drop? It's obvious to investors they are prioritizing China's market. This means, more money...
Stocks ebb and flow constantly. You won’t see any changes til the next fiscal quarter if it shows a large decrease in customers and revenue. Til then it’ll be business as usual for them.
unscathed so far...we want to hurt them we need to not buy their next game in several months or years  


this is the start, not the end
>Do you want to know why Blizzard's stock hasn't gone down like EA's did?

>Because EA actually launched a game that crashed and made a ton less money than it was supposed to. Blizzard hasn't done anything that the boycott could be felt with, and the only thing that Blizzard has coming up to show it is Blizzcon.

>If you look at the Stocks for EA back in July of last year, they were at a massive $148 per share. Then Battlefront 2 came out in August and did abysmally, causing it to lower to $76 by December.

>The only thing that pulled EA's stock out of its slump was a very successful game coming out, which was Apex Legends, and if you look at their stocks, they still aren't above $100 again (They did peak into $101 twice, but that was because of Anthem).

>Blizzcon and the next Blizzard and/or activision game will show massive damage to their stocks, if the boycott holds until them.
I'm gonna make an educated guess and say that China is buying their stock in the same amount as the sales, so the price keeps being stable. I'd have to check their market volume and activities but too lazy right now as I'm off to bed. if someone wants to have a go perhaps we could find rough numbers of short hands that left the sinking ship in these last few days.
You havnt even said a thing of substance. Why shouldnt we do what we can? Even though it may be small.
They're a company. If they weren't concerned with money they wouldn't still exist.
or make Diablo 4 a good game.

Lets be honest here, gamers have a very short memory and gaming is an addiction. So when they need their next fix they will take it. As much as I want them to crash and burn I doubt it will make a difference in the long run. If gamers had some conscience and self respect EA wouldn't exist.
I for one am not interested in being "won back". All I actually needed to know about Blizzard is the fact that they are associated with Activision...that's more than enough for me. This whole debacle is just icing, and a cherry.
Same here brother. I will always remember and cherish my memories of the Blizzard of old. It's important to understand this is not the same company. They only share a name. All of the greats that made old blizzard what it was are long gone.
Protesting at Blizzcon is all well and good, but you're basically paying them to protest. Why not just not even go?
Nope. If they change their ways the boycott ends.
Blizzard was going to shit long before activision bought them.
Blizzard knew what they were getting into, its not like Activision bad rep wasn't popular knowledge back ten.
No, not these days. Blizzard is far from a good company, even without Activision. Time and time again they keep proving their target audience isn't the people that carried them to fame anymore. They couldn't care less about those who have played their games since childhood. 

They've alienated those who care about their games in favour of the mouth breathers from twitter. The same type of people they've steadily been hiring to replace those that they fire.
Like "most people" don't even know what Diablo: Immortal is?
Silly me for forgetting how the fourth panel went. Seen this comic used as a template so many times, it just gets fuzzy when I tried to recall how it looks.

acquisition
Blizzard depends on corporations like Sony and Microsoft to disseminate their games, potentially eliminating a platform would be detrimental to sales figures.  But neither would do it because they need China too.
You mean how blizzard was involved in an unrelated event? They really should drop the title of game publisher and just get into politics since that’s what they are known for now
Point of order, Bungie have since separated from Acti. Destiny 2 is no longer on the Bnet launcher but on Steam.
Just FYI, stocks can move pretty quickly- Roku dropped close to 30 percent in a single day off of a single analyst changin their rating and Comcast announcing a giveaway of a single product.

But ATVI won't move a whole lot, because, as you said, there are many more products that aren't really associated with Blizzard that still provide significant value to the company.
people think googling NYSE or NASDAQ makes them economist. The real effect of this fiasco will be shown at the end of Q4 in december. That's when you know if people are really into it or just virtue-signaling for fake internet updoots.
“Stocks don't move that fast....  Nothing short of an Enron scandal or global recession will cause a stock to crater within one week.”

*laughs in biotech and pharma*
I very sincerely hope you are correct, but, I think in this case (and I think the temporary freeze on deleting accounts supports this) that Activision is expecting sentiment to fizzle in the face of consumers having to actually forgo the use of their favourite addiction software. I fear they’ve made the right prediction here.
Yep, agree. It’s on us.
I don't know where you get your figures from, but their stock price was $47.03 jan 1 and it's $55.03 now, a 17% increase, just today it is up $1.34 (2.5%)

https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=blizzard+stock+price

The only metrics by which they are down are the 1 year, 5 day or 1 month prices, if you look at 5 years, YTD or 6 months they are all positive
J. Allen Brack is literally the CEO so I'm not sure where you're hearing these things
Sure, I’m just taking issue with these celebratory posts, suggesting that actiblizzard has somehow been punished. they haven’t. the outrage is valuable but if you want them to listen a great deal more is necessary. *I’m* not buying anything from the company for now, either. But no one’s been vanquished, here, no victories have been won, and Activision is most certainly not “on fire”.
I really, really doubt it.

The thing is, we’re in a unique time for consumer relations. In the past, if you were unhappy with a company you bought from the competitor.

But there *isn’t* really a competitor for, say, Azeroth; if you have played WoW for years, there’s no where else to go. If you’ve dumped hundreds of dollars into your HS collection, you can’t take it to MtG or whatever, and neither are those experiences *really* direct replacements (compared with, say, switching from Nike to Rebok). Additionally, games are addictiion software, they’re engineered to be emotionally difficult to stop using, let alone abandon.

I think, honestly, what’s really happening is that Activision-Blizzard have the data, run the numbers, and accurately concluded that this will, in fact, blowover, insofar as we’ll hate them more but not significantly pay them less.

And if data-driven analytics all indicate that their profitability won’t be impacted, shareholders have no reason to pull out. The tl;dr is, the outrage doesn’t actually reflect consumer activity in this case.
Very well could be exactly what's happening. If that's the case I expect them to leave the country, either willingly or by economic force if necessary.
I've wondered that, too, but it could also be lingering buy orders for when the stock dips below a certain price being triggered, too.

It would definitely fit the government's M.O. to throw some cash at the stock to make it look like falling in line and toeing the party line is profitable, though.
A voice of reason.
I sincerely hope you’re right. If the number of people reporting their departure from blizz products is real, we’ll see soon enough. I’d like it if my “realism” turns out to be cynicism. Good chat, ntmy.
In the normal course of events, yes; but (actual) trauma to a business usually results in reactive selling; hence my position that Activision is doing fine.
I’m not remotely versed in market economics, but I saves your reply because I’m curious about that too, now.
>	Not that the outrage isn’t meaningful; I think generating awareness, shaping public sentiment and issuing a warning cry for the inevitable future wherein we contend with this again are valuable.
In a strict sense yes, but they made a choice of money over good will. Not everything a corporation does has to be about money.
They would much rather you didn't go than you go and embarrass them there :)
Becuase it's already sold out and the tickets are nonrefundable. The people who bought tickets to blizzcon months ago already gave them money. Not going would be a wasted opportunity to spread awareness. Also, a waste of money.
Well, I meant that.

>You have gone to a place I cannot follow. I hope you find reason.

I feel like thats familiar but cant place it...
Correct, and I don't want Sony, Microsoft, or Nintendo to be in charge of what games should be available on their platforms based on politics. It's a slippery slope. 

Having other companies censor in the opposite direction is not a solution. It's up to consumers to decide who to support or not.
Blizzard made a political call about one of its pro players and streamers at one of its gaming events. People now don't want to pay them money. Not sure how its "unrelated" or what you're on about.
Oh boy am I glad they skedaddled soon enough to avoid this shit.
Also in part that ATVI lost nearly 30% last year over two months.

It could very well be near a technical resistance point.
Aren't they down, like, 30-ish% compared to "just before Blizzcon 2018"-time? I seem to remember the stock fiddling about at almost 80 or so same time last year.
Always happy to share sources! Glad we can compile to see what's really going on here.

Positive over the last few years seems to make sense, considering how well the last WoW expansion did as well as the release and thriving of Overwatch. To me, it looks like since last Blizzcon they took a big hit (Diablo Immortal?). BFA probably started to suffer from sub-loss around that time as well, as it dropped about 2 months prior. I would also assume that the 6-month positives you see are directly tied to in-game store purchases within BFA. Store mounts and other items you can buy in-game with real money have been releasing at a much higher rate than ever before. In my head, the only logical reason for this is to buff those numbers up that they lost from the underwhelming reception of BFA and Diablo Immortal in the eyes of their investors... I am personally worries that this will continue once Diablo Immortal is inveitably dropped/re-mentioned during this year's con. It would make sense that Activision would want to protect their ability to monetize the Chinese market given that is where they make the majority of their mobile game profits. It just is sad that Blizzard games are being used to seemingly fill the pockets of Activision corporate overhead...
That dude is a lot of things, but not a CEO.
True, but I think this will have an effect over all, there is also the truth about when your hot your hot, when your not your not.  There is often  a delay in these things that take a few years, after diablo immortal and this, people are going to be more critical about what blizzard does, and question it more.  Look at fallout 76, it hasn't killed bethesda, BUT the problems people ignored in skyrim, morrowind, and oblivion are going to be FAR less likly to be ignored in elderscrolls 6.  

Same here, mistakes and problems that blizzard makes form this point on arn't going to be given as much of a benefit of the doubt.

AKA when your hot, people ignore the problems and praise the good stuff, when your not, people focus on the problems and the good things just don't get the same traction.

EA's starting to go through this, as they are both pushing fans too far, and fans have less tolerance for things.
Yeah, it's a fear of mine that this will all just wash away with people going back to the game because of shiny events and loot boxes, too.  I'm sure some of that fear is because of how tempting I find them personally, despite being searingly angry and feeling betrayed.  My hope is that if I can stay strong, other people will at least be as dedicated as I am, if not more, if for no other reason than gamers do really like being angry at stuff, so this is our skill.

But really we'll just have to wait and see.
it's much more effective to simply speak out about them and never touch any of their products ever again. they'd pocket the cash and not give a damn about whatever it is you do from there.
from what i've seen, it looks like they care more about money than their reputation
Ah, then agreed with what you meant, just not with what you wrote, lol.
A lot of shitty decisions in their games and PR has been on their own.
Seeing that Activision Blizzards stock market value this day is exactly 66.9% of the value one year ago, I'd venture a guess that some people still remember something. And no, this current debacle didn't dent it enough to account for that drop. It was still around the current level a month ago.

Unless you would suggest that it's purely coincidental that their stocks plummeted in the weeks right after Blizzcon 2018 and have remained at that level up until today?
They got tired of Acti like 6 months ago
Absolutely, good point.
I'd be really surprised if they tried to push diablo immortal after it's reception last year.

As far as the stock price goes, it looks like it hit an all time peak in september 18 (around $80) was on a downward trend until about June and has been on the upswing since. Looking at the numbers overall it doesn't seem like it has immediately effected the stock price but then again we are only a few days into this situation and stocks take some time to respond to stuff like this, while the investors bide their time and wait to see how the whole thing shakes out.
Idk if you're being metaphorical or not but he literally is, that's his title
Well said; I utterly agree with you that subsequent disappointment in product quality (mobile diablo lololol) are probably going to have more dramatic impacts than they might have done after this much damage to the loyalty blizz once enjoyed. I do, however, think that making bad products will also be necessary; sentiment alone is more likely to be a catalyst than a cause.
This is beautifully honest my dude.

We definitely don’t have to stop playing blizz games, just funding them. This has to move slowly, and it’s waaaaay bigger than any one company besides. In my original post i meant what I said; the outrage does *something*. I personally think the reasonable commitment is to stay informed and vigilant fornthe moment when more than conversation is due. And I write my MPs (governers, in the US, I think).
True, but the money is already lost, so they might as well make sure Blizzard can't use press photos from their expensive event.
I really hope your right, although my gut tells me that they will want to monetize this as soon as possible. They had a playable demo at Blizzcon last year, so I am assuming that they will make an actual announcement with a date this con. Considering how they protected their hand in the that market, would they not want to monetize it as soon as possible?

Peaking in September sounds right on the money as that was not too long after the release of BFA. On a downward trend until June makes sense as that was when they dropped another store mount as well as that was when they did their last pre-planned Beta for classic (Although they did one right before release (late July/early August?), it wasn't announced that it would happen until is basically happened).

You are right though as only time will tell. Investors I am sure are playing the field here carefully. Blizzcon will be Paramount this year for Blizzard, I just hope they get it right.
He is the President, not the CEO.
as people said last year and I agree, diablo immortal would have been fine if it was along side diablo 4 announcement or even a diablo 1 or 2 remake, least something to give us hope.
I could be wrong but I have a feeling they are going to minimize the Diablo Immortal exposure here and really push it in the Chinese gaming market, which was their target for it anyways.
