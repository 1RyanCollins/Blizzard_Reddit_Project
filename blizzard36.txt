I’m glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family’s organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).
I hope Blizzcon gets rekted by protest.
#FireBobbyKotick
Oh! *That's* who Sseth's, avatar is of.
They really gonna have to think their way our of this one. Popcorn ready.
They are trying ride this one out, hoping it dies down. Please don't let them go that easily
[removed]
Right, when do we get a response? Today I hope.
Hey hey people
He's always been horrid and this proves it further.
Whelp, the Markets are about to open, and this will determin if ActiBlizz responds, if it drops though the floor they will have to give a statement to appease their shareholders.  If it doesn't then they will ignore it and pretend it never happened by sacking everyone that was near to the 'event' in question.
Fuck them all pieces of shit

I’ll probably get downvoted, but at least to me it seems they were just trying to not be political
Should change it's name to Bobby Bootlick
Capitalism at its finest boys
He's a spineless greed infested piece of shit.
Hey hey people
The same pattern as last year's Diablo:Immoral shitstorm. 

They will first wait for the rage to settle by not saying anything to further fuel it, then run a vague statement through several departments and law firms, and in about a week from now they will come up with some empty PR blurb statement with some fake "understanding" about people's reaction but without committing to changing a single thing.
The mana cost should be a dollar sign
I get it 0 health because by banning the tournament winner he destroyed himself
Bobby Kotick supports Nazism
I see Blizzard's Wikipedia page was already updated, but I'm surprised no one has updated Kotick's.
 You gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China
Link to the original artist at least.

He should be 10 or 25 mana. Because this POS is super expensive and you get very little value for your investment.
I know this is Bobby but I'm seeing an African warlord as well...
Jeff Kaplan I trusted you 😭😭😭😭😭
i like how his card is litereally 0 everywhere. hahhaahaha
Don't forget how a few months ago Blizzard fired 800 of their employees for NO FUCKING REASON.
*inhale*  
  
# HEY HEY PEOPLE, MAO ZEDONG HERE
*Definitely* a circle, amirite?
I think it's very telling that Kotick, as a Jewish man, has not addressed the decision made by his company regarding the HK humanitarian crisis.
The tribe should be scum bag and the mana cost 11, the only way to discount it, is with China’s mobile market
They should give that kid his prize money back for starters.
Hey it's the guy from moneyball
#boycottblizzard
Bobby Kotick was in Jeffrey Epstein's little black book.
We haven't heard anything yet but they have let the Chinese hear something and that is they support China.

this picture offends me, the Devil is much nicer then Bobby Kotick...
i thought i'm gonna see the joker movie, fuck it, this is more important. fucking blizzard.
Edgelord takes photo from reddit and reposts
Well, it will be like the usuals. Do nothing, let the things cool down and people will forget it and move on.
So basically you guys want to trash a game for not letting you hijack their platform for your political movement knowing that it will get them in trouble.

This is why nobody fucking wants politics in gaming.
If you’re posting this against your will, blink twice
1 they are evil crop

2 they learn from china, just dont reply to make it a cold action

they just want the discussion go down when days has gone
Just storm blizzcon with Hong Kong posters, even if security starts kicking out attendees cuz of that
Imagine planning what is perhaps the most exciting Blizzcon they've ever had. Diablo 4 will be announced, the next WoW expansion will be announced, hell, they might even announce whatever Overwatch related product they've been working on.

And then their stupid asses do something like this and everything is ruined. If videogame developers/publishers had feet.. well, they wouldn't have feet. Because those feet would have been shot so many times that they'd be gone.

So few companies seem to be able to just bring us some good news. They always need to do something to cast a pall over everything they do, and in this case, Blizzard went for one of the worst PR blunders ever. This shit is so bad that even my lazy and usually apathetic friends have expressed their disapproval towards this, and one of them is considering canceling his sub to WoW Classic.
I'm so excited to see it go down. They deserve it and any employee who hasn't put in their notice by then deserves to deal with the difficulties.
I hope people go there, but stay at the door, protesting for the whole duration, not one individual going inm kae their own party outside, celebrating freedom with each other.
I dunno if peoples fury will be as strong as it is now, in 3,5 weeks time. Had this all happened a few days before, good lord it would be glorious, but I suspect it'll blow a bit over by then =(
Hey hey, people...
I always thought it was Joel Osteen.
There's a company-wide shortest straw drawing for who is gonna do the press release.
Weird ass crypto shit though. No one wants to touch that.
It's still only 9am on the West Coast.  Imagine being a fly on the wall of those offices!
Wait... a repost? On Reddit?? That certainly can't be true. That's never happened before. Ever!
yeah that was the initial statement they made before the large backlash and before the news got wind of it.
Not being political would be taking no action.  Banning the player and casters and taking his winnings is an extremely political thing to do.
The act of banning the player and confiscating all his earnings is in itself a political act
the world is political, money is political. You can't be in bed with other governments and avoid politics.
They were just trying to make as much money as possible and fuck whoever gets hurt by it.
yeah seems like it. but then again they could have just quickly gone back and let the guy have his prize once there was a backlash. seems like the best way to end this
Commenting on Reddit is? I'm sure the people would be ok with you seeing a movie and say #firebobby later
They already removed his eyes for donation.
They can't stop them all. People just need to Naruto run to evade the security guards.
this whole thing will blow over by then. internet social justice crusaders are pathetic, all of these people "boycotting" blizzard will buy diablo 4 and then post on reddit how amazing it is.
Don't get upset with developers. They have families and need to take care of them. They may not agree but they aren't going to lose their jobs just to make a statement.
Guess what. It won't. Even their stock slightly recovered today. And i wouldn't wonder if not even 1000 people that claimed to boycott them quitted everything.
No. I'm pissed at blizzard as well, but no. It's the ceo, not the employees who are at fault. Don't make the workers suffer.
Yeah how about you start the charge by quitting  your job. See how much you'll do punish China for being shit.  Don't use anything made that was made in China.  Quit your job in protest. See how much of a difference you'll make.  Chances are you'll just be replaced by someone willing to work.
Not that weird. You just actually own the cards you open in game.

You can trade them to other players, or just outright sell them.
Nothing weird about ethereum.
They are probably in complete melt down, between people canceling their pre orders, wow subs or deleting their battlenet altogether on one side, and blizzard/Hong Kong memes getting upvoted to the front page and likely creeping up where China will take notice on another.
Actually, I'm sure it's completely and utterly silent. The only thing you'll hear there today is the nervous shuffling of people living in fear. Because everyone with principles has already left.
It's a pretty severe punishment. Could have suspended him for a week, could have issued a warning.
He doesn't need eyes to sing praises.
Also use kagebunshin jutsu to overwhelm the guards
Your pessimism is not unfounded, but personally I am more optimistic about things like this. I'd rather hope for the best than expect the worst. And calling people who are willing to show their disapproval pathetic isn't helping anyone.
Just doing your job isnt a valid excuse for human rights violations.
Of course none of this is their direct fault but let's not act like this wouldn't be highly educated and talented people working for an industry leader. 

Everyone with Blizzard in their CV will be fine. Even when the ship's finally sinking, they'll float.
Well then they are shitheads just like the nazis who weren't about to lose their jobs just to make a statement.
That just means they made the same decision blizzard did. That money is more important than human rights. They don't get a pass.
developers do ok in the labor market these days, perhaps you're unaware
Don't get upset with organ harvesters. They have families and need to take care of them.
Fuck that mentality. It is the people working for them that make everything they do possible. If you know your employer is evil and you keep workin g for them, ***you are evil***. It’s ***literally*** the same thing Blizzard is doing... willingly doing unethical things in exchange for money. You’re a hoe just like Blizzard, you’re just a much cheaper hoe.
Wow. As someome that quit hearthstone because p2w and lack of trading in a TRADING CARD GAME this actually seems like a good alternative outside of the political motivation
Putting everything on a blockchain was dumb in 2017 and it didnt age well. Its stupid and the creepy factor of being associated with the crime laden scams and ponzis etc that anything crypto is mired in doesnt help. Also the crypto cultists on reddit is extremely offputting.
Except the games extremely hard to actually start playing if you have no experience with block chain stuff
Well we already saw that crowd of Blizzard employees out front by the statue with umbrellas in solidarity
well im sure u wouldnt like to be homeless just cus u support something, right? Boycott Blizzard, do not hurt the workers that have no other choices.
Doing your job as a game developer or support staff does *not* mean you are violating human rights. That is a massive mental leap that cannot be made reasonably.
Survival is more of a priority than big world issues... If ppl were well fed and less anxious about their personal finances, they would focus on bigger issues like human rights and global warming.
Everyone? You must not work in the industry. If you're a "rockstar" dev in your 20s/30s you might easily get a job outside of the gaming industry, but to stay in the gaming industry is ultra competitive, overworked and underpaid for their talent levels.
Well i guess you're about to destroy everything you own that has contributed money into the Chinese economy? Blizzard is a big company with thousands of employees that does not have the luxury of getting by while finding another job because of bad decisions their employer made.   


This have absolutely nothing to do with nazis, but if we are being frank most "Nazis" during ww2 were just regular germans trying to survive (and thus not prosecuted after the war). 

Idiot.
You’re differently takening it too far
Not that I support people continuing to work for blizzard but this is idneed true, most have a family to maintain at home. Would you leave your job and put your family in a potential crisisfor this? If yes then I assume you do not have a family yet.

And no, Blizzard workers are not to be compared to the nazis, I don't see how the developers are in anyway behaving like nazis at this point, there are many signs that most of them do **not** support this decision.
The devs are not the higher ups, THEY HAVE NO SAY IN THIS. You wouldn't quit your job and put your family at risk just because the higher ups did something you don't agree with.

This is as game development job, these thing aren't easy to find.
This *just* happened.  How do you, and everyone else dumping on Blizzard devs, know that at least some of them aren't looking for new employment right now?  These things take time, even for experienced devs (I'm one), and are not always a slam-dunk.
What a shitty fucking take. Also a completely false equivalence. Don't blame this on the employees, they are regular human beings trying to get by. They have no control over what bad decisions the management do and often not the luxury of just finding another job.
Tumblr is leaking I see.
Some people are getting mad about the selling aspect.

But name a card game you can’t do that for irl
You okay?

I just like their marketing.
They never advertised it as an easy game to get into?

Sounds like you’re comparing apples to oranges.
Actually I haven't - was that in this sub?  

And, of course, I comment with hyperbole. I honestly do not expect employees to leave en masse. After all, if they have a chance to fix things, that is, by far, the better option.   

But there is some truth... it was only a few months ago that everyone who fought against the removal of the "bonus" system wound up retiring or moving on.
Fuck them for supporting a communist state's will with their labor. Find a new job.
You dont seem to get it.

Companies are not people. Everyone involved is to and has to be held accountable. By being afraid of losing their jobs, they're, quite simply, enabling the process.

Just like we, as consumers,  can do our part by not giving Blizzard money. Unless you're afraid of losing the 10+ years you put into WoW, then you're just another cog in the problem machine.

The developers will get hurt if we dont pay their company, and they'd be out of a job anyways when they start downsizing. Again.

And for all the 'fine' folks who responded to me, who're willing to put up with this sort of bullshit and tyranny for the sake of 'fuck muh freedoms, I need muh job'  


[Crossposting from r/news](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/dfn3yi/blizzard_employees_staged_a_walkout_after_the/)  


There are Blizzard employees that have more spine than you.  Good on them.  Fuck Blizzard.
Ah yes, these talented people in their well paying jobs have no savings to fall back on or any skills in demand in the industry.

Fuck the workers, they are supporting this shit just as much as anyone else in the company.
I'd love to see how many of these armchair warriors playing the blame game would take a leaf out of their own book and do what they are expecting of the Blizzard staff (most of whom have very fucking little to do with this decision). My guess approximates to roughly *zero*.
These developers won't go hungry. These are high demand skill sets, and unless they are entirely incompetent when it comes to money then they should have at least several months worth of savings and thats plenty of time to find new work at a place with less human rights violations as part of their day to day operations.
> but to stay in the gaming industry is ultra competitive, overworked and underpaid for their talent levels.

And? Should I feel sorry now for the people who hypothetically couldn't work in the most greedy and manipulative industry anymore if they wanted to take a stand against human rights vioations? 

Sorry, I don't.
That's such an invalid argument that's being thrown around.  How does destroying a product that has already been fully paid for do anything?

Refusing to **continue** to support and pay for products does make a difference.
No, I am not a racist. I don’t have anything against Chinese people or Chinese companies. It’s utterly astounding how difficult that seems to be for people to understand. You are a racist bigot.
> Blizzard is a big company with thousands of employees that does not have the luxury of getting by while finding another job because of bad decisions their employer made.

Blizzard is an industry leader and only hires highly educated or talented people. They are working in a booming industry, in one of the richest countries in the world. 

Noone currently working at Blizzard will have a problem finding another job somewhere else in case shit will hit the fan (if it hasn't already).
He's not though.
Yeah this sub is just a big joke.
Yes I would quit my job if I worked for Blizzard right now. No question. My money is absolutely where my mouth is. Fuck any employee who keeps working for Blizzard. They are knowingly doing evil things for an evil company just for a bit of money.
Just doing your job isnt an excuse to commit human rights violations.
Yea some of these comments are bad jokes and you can tell they are made from people living in their mother's basement. Having people quit their careers that they spent decades building over a player suspension is a bad joke. If China literally oozied this player into the ground then sure, but he just got suspended.The playerbase needs to respond to this act. The developers are professionals, I'm pretty sure they are making their voice heard privately but aren't going to destroy their lives over something like this.
I mean a Blizzard employee covered the "every voice matters" carving that is a part of the statue located in front of Blizzard HQ.

So I guess not all of them are bad.
I'm just saying it's overly complicated just to try to play it which is saddening
Just curious, what exactly do you do for a living?
You never were in vidya game industry, were you? If u get a job, you've won in life. its not like corpo work or anything else
Such an easy sentiment to have when it's not your livelihood on the line. I'm willing to bet a year's paycheck that 90% of people demanding the employees do something would bitch out if they were in that situation.
So what you're implying is that because somebody who has a wife/husband, children, a house, a car, bills.. A LIFE! That they should just up and quit their job and leave a company because a group of shareholders made horrible choices? That they should uproot everything they've worked for because of other peoples decisions? That they should jeopardize their lives to make a statement to a company that PROBABLY doesn't give a shit that they're resigning anyways because, let's face it, they can hire a new employee to fill their shoes in a heartbeat?

&#x200B;

Stop white knighting dude when YOU clearly don't get it.
Human lives seem to lose value among the most ardent idealists.
If every good person quit, what would be left? What possibility for change would there be at that point?
Out of curiosity, what car are u driving if u have one and what phone do u have?
Guilty by association? That's a bit ridiculous. I can say with certainty that most of the employees at Blizzard had no say, or no pull, when it came to the decisions made regarding this issue. 

&#x200B;

As somebody who works in network security for a large company, my company has made many decisions that resulted in people being fired or  sued that had left me completely baffled that I also had absolutely no say in. So judging by your example I'm just as guilty as those people? That's fucking ignorant lmfao.
Wow. What fantasy world do you live in? I work for a company I fundamentally disagree with as do many people because job transitions are not as easy as you make it out to be. Holy shit. I cannot stand idealistic assholes willing to shatter the livelihoods of real ppl. This goes for movement purists who think rioters should be sinless saints and for the other side of the spectrum where ppl should give up their cashflows and means of living for their families over something like this. This is up to the individual. And families will always come first.
Those developers dont have any say in these political games. They are where they are because they have a love and passion for video games and are striving to make the games the best they can be. Why else are they wasting their time in an ultra competitive field with poor job security, inconsistent pay and insane hours?

Fuck China but dont let your hatred blind you to the fact that these are people too.
I know this many be difficult to understand, but blizzard is not run by 1 guy. There are thousands of employee's who have no effect on the political agenda of the company. Many are just there to get a pay check to feed families. 

So for you to automatically assume that everybody who works there is some how apart of this "Greedy and Manipulative Industry" is a little ignorant. Not everybody is just going to drop what they're doing and risk their livelihood for other people. It would be silly to ask them to do so. It's a nice thought to idealize towards, but it doesn't work in reality. 

Also, you do realize that almost every industry in one way or another has violated human rights in one way or another?  I highly doubt your'e boycotting your soap distributor because they used it on animals first, or boycotting your local McDonalds because it takes 660 gallons of water to make a single hamburger. 

and,

Generally the main goal of any business is to acquire as much money as possisble, as fast as possible. So in a sense, the majority of all businesses are greedy. Blizzard is no less greedy than any other company. They just got caught selling their virtues out in the open, usually companies do that stuff in private, so they don't get as much negative press.
While i agree that the argument itself is shit, it's about as stupid as putting the blame on the employees. We as customers have the luxury of voting with our wallets, and so we should. Cancel your Blizzard subscriptions, spread the memes, I'm all for it. 

But an employee may not have the benefit of being able to survive by quitting their jobs to make a moral statement though. It is not their battle to take.
That is crazy ignorant and not how the world works. First of all, your assessment is not true. Blizzard is not made up of developers (who may and not may not be highly educated), but also customers service reps, sales people, office clerks, pr reps, designers, tech supporters etc. etc. There are lots of employees going paycheck to paycheck who's life would literally fall apart having to switch jobs on a moments notice.

Secondly, even a "highly educated" person may find themselves having difficulties finding a new job quick. I'm what you would call "highly educated" in one of the richest Scandinavian counties in the world, but it would be very, very inconvenient for me if i were to quit my job today. And then I'm one of the lucky ones  because i actually have some savings.

Once again, it's not up to the employees to fight the battles of their employers.
Working on a game is a lot different to " committing human rights violations " brother. Like what, should the entirety of Germany have just laid down to die in WWII? You know, because working in a bakery in germany is committing human rights violations because of the nazis. While we're at it I guess all of the inhabitants in the countries that supported Germany should've done the same according to your logic /shrug
Well, as of now while the game is still in Beta
Another thing is that working for Blizzard is likely a dream job for a large majority of the employees there. Many people have struggled really hard to land a job in that company and will likely never leave unless forced. Also, is just plainly really hard to get a job in the video game industry. A lot of people might be holding out hope that the company will come to its senses and go back to how it used to be, even though that will probably never happen.
Anybody that thinks Blizzard employees should quit their jobs over this probably live with their parents and never had to work for a living. Don't mind them. They are probably kids. At least I hope so.
Shitty games made by Blizzard, which is where things are going anyways.  The developers will go to other companies, or start their own and return to making good games by gamers, rather than for corporate interests (I.E. Lootboxes, Microtransactions, etc).

Some companies are beyond change, you can see it in how they act.  Blizzard stepped over that line finally and joined the ranks of EA.  Unlike EA, they don't have a monopoly on any type of game.
Got em
Ah great to hear your family's comfort matters more than the struggle of an entire population. You dont have to work where you do, you chose that. You choose to support shitty companys that dont give a fuck about human rights as they bleed the working class dry.
> Why else are they wasting their time in an ultra competitive field with poor job security, inconsistent pay and insane hours

Blizzard pays above industry average and has no crazy crunch culture going on. 

If your passion is with video games you should maybe try to work for a company with a matching passion. 

Blizzard hasn't released a new game since 2016, and their most successful game is a relaunch of a 15 year old game. Blizzard doesn't care about games, they care about monetization.
> So for you to automatically assume that everybody who works there is some how apart of this "Greedy and Manipulative Industry" is a little ignorant.

How so? They are quite literally part of it. Nobody in the history of modern western societies was ever forced to work for a corporation they deemed immoral or unethical. Yet, a lot of people do it voluntarily.

> Not everybody is just going to drop what they're doing and risk their livelihood for other people.

Nobody working for an industry leading company in a booming industry in one of the richest countries on earth is risking their "livelihood".

The people in Hong Kong though, they do. Quite literally, and almost daily.
I agree that the dude you were replying to is stupid to equate Blizzard employees to Nazis. 

I personally have uninstalled all Blizzard games and ended my sub to wow. I will be making informed decisions on my purchases here on out. 

I have also emailed my state representatives in the hopes that they will voice their concerns and act upon it.
> but it would be very, very inconvenient for me if i were to quit my job today.

Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that you would be inconvenienced. 

I think the people being imprisoned in Chinese concentration camps because of nothing but their religion, or slaves who have their organs harvested for the Chinese elite class, or citizens thrown in prison for life for speaking their minds, could also be mildly inconvenienced by their situations. 

But you're right, let's protect a corporation bending the knee to an inhumane regime, so noone gets accidentally inconvenienced. 

Thank you for your perspective and compassion, you're making the first world a better place!
No one says they have to work there making games. Hell these people could quit their jobs today and not be working for a company that has china way of thinking. Oh no your family might go through a bit of a hard time, but if youre not incompetent you have a few months worth of savings and will find new work. But no wouldnt want anyone to be uncomfortable with the new Chinese overlords, best to just keep working it doesnt matter that youre sucking china dick.
So that's the reason I can't login?
Canceled all my accounts today. Uninstalling the blizzard app. Fuck that behavior. If Blizzard wants to suck Chinese dick for money, they better get comfortable for the long haul, because they're not getting more of my money.

 Id definitely quit my job if my employer pulled this shit, btw. And I work in the labs are a major pharmaceutical manufacturer.... Jobs are easy to replace. Human lives are not.
Lmao. You sound like an entitled brat tbh.
My point is, you're dragging low level developers into this who dont really deserve the hate. You sound like it's so easy to just switch jobs at a whim when the studio you work for makes unfavorable decisions. I don't doubt that blizzard employees right now are beginning to look for a different job. It's been 1 fucking day, do you seriously think they'll just find another job immediately?

Speaking as someone who works in the fucking industry, calm the fuck down. Theres literally no reason to get upset over lower level developers who just want to make video games. Criticize blizzard, cancel your subs and stop playing their games, but why would you waste your time trying to bash on the developers? Like I said. It's been a single day, do you seriously expect any blizzard employee to already have a new job?
How many games should company release every 3 years? 10? 20? For example, GTA5 was released in 2013, whilst RDR2 was released in 2018. That\`s 5 years total. Is it a bad company?
Being apart of something doesn't make you automatically held responsible for the whole thing.

Do you blame the soldier who is apart of the war? No, you blame the person giving him the commands, the general or authority figure. Blaming the solider is pointless because they have no say over their situation.

This is very similar, the employee's had no input on the actions that took place, so to hold them responsible for the actions that their superior's made is unfair for the employee's. Nothing they could have done would have changed the outcome that happened. This is why they are innocent.

These employee's cannot also be asked to quit their jobs on the spot because you feel it to be right. Many have mortgages, bills, and daily living expenses. Not everybody has the luxury of quitting their job on the spot. Just because they're in the richest countries in the world, doesn't automatically make them rich people. 

What you should be suggesting be done is the person who was in charge of the decision gets fired. There is no reason for more people to get hurt. Only those who deserve it. 

In an ideal world, it would be nice if everybody grouped up against injustice, but in reality it doesn't always play out that way.
Wow, talk about citing things out of context to win an argument. I am not advocating for the horrific crimes against humanity made by the Chinese government, but i think you know that by arguing in bad faith.

I'm saying that battle is not the responsibility of the employees of Blizzard. If they have the ability to quit to make a statement and find new job, thats great! But if they're not able to, it's not fair to berate them for it.
It's really easy to say that when it's not your family.
> Oh no your family might go through a bit of a hard time

"Sorry you can't eat today. Daddy needs to take a political stand even though I'm a tech support rep and not a high level decision maker."
All talk. And  a big pharma job? LOL Do you even know what you represent since you're all high and mighty about what people do with their jobs? Start packing up now.
Lol I see youve run out of arguments so youre just attacking me directly. Good debate, seems we are done here.
> I don't doubt that blizzard employees right now are beginning to look for a different job. It's been 1 fucking day, do you seriously think they'll just find another job immediately?

It's not been one day. Blizzard shitting on the western market to cater to the Chinese mobile crap market is a trend that's been visible for the public for exactly one year, probably even longer internally. 

I've never said that they should or need to find another job right away, my point is more that most people, including those virtue signaling umbrella peeps on social media, won't even look for a new job out of sheer convenience or indifference. 

> Like I said. It's been a single day, do you seriously expect any blizzard employee to already have a new job?

No, and I've never said anything like that. But I guarantee you that in 3 months from now the people in this *"Hey let's cover up the statue for social media points!"* picture will most likely all still be working at Blizzard.

> Speaking as someone who works in the fucking industry, calm the fuck down.

Speaking as someone who has worked in this industry for 7 years, I am perfectly calm.
How many IPs does Rockstar actively maintain compared to Blizzard? Yeah, that's exactly where your argument falls apart.
> Do you blame the soldier who is apart of the war?

Of course I do, lol. You can't just apply for a position as soldier, even sign up for deployment abroad, and then you're automatically freed from any and all moral responsibility just because someone is giving you orders. 

Are you seriously believing what you're writing there? I mean how gullible are people in your eyes? Do we even have free will or smth like that?

> These employee's cannot also be asked to quit their jobs on the spot because you feel it to be right.

Which is why I've never did anything like that. Like who are you even talking to, you're apparently speaking with someone I can't see or hear. 

> Just because they're in the richest countries in the world, doesn't automatically make them rich people.

Again, a total straw man that noone ever said. It does however make them privileged enough to be in the position to apply for new jobs.

> What you should be suggesting be done is the person who was in charge of the decision gets fired. There is no reason for more people to get hurt. Only those who deserve it.

I'm not asking anyone to get hurt so please cut back on the dramatization in your rhetoric a little. 

> In an ideal world, it would be nice if everybody grouped up against injustice, but in reality it doesn't always play out that way.

Of course not because most people value convenience, money, and security higher than integrity or human rights violations at the other end of the world.
Yes though, you ***are*** advocating for those things. You are *clearly* advocating that the people responsible for it just keep doing it.

That’s what it means when the company you work for is doing evil. Companies aren’t independent entities, they are made up of individuals that actually carry out the actions without whom there is no evil. That’s it. A bunch of individuals making individual decisions to continue helping evil.

Which you are clearly here advocating they continue doing in order to avoid inconvenience.

I guess it’s hard for a collectivist racist such as yourself to grasp the concept, but companies are just a bunch of individuals doing individual things and nothing stops until the individuals stop.
Nothing's taken out of context. If your employer supports a regime like this by catering to them to the point of firing unpleasant casters, you indirectly support these actions. 

Covering a statue is a nice act of virtue signaling but if you still offer your labor force to this corporation you are complicit in supporting the regime, whether you want to or not. 

> But if they're not it aint fair to berate them for it.

We all have different standards for integrity it seems.
So its fine to support human rights violations as long as your family is comfortable?
Bullshit dishonest argument. It’s obviously possible to get a new job without your kids going hungry.
If your job youre at is the only job you think you can get youre not qualified to be leading a family. Youre not even willing to think of slightly lowering your luxury bubble to think about the world around you.
Enjoy your job at blizzard. Hope you enjoy all those yen.
You have to be even more deluded than I thought of you assumed this was ever a ”debate.” Spoken like a fresh college grad who never held a job or doesn’t understand what responsibility looks like. Honestly am embarrassed for you. ✌️
Based off of your original comment, you're not very calm. Doesnt seem like anything I say makes sense to you, and all you're doing is for some reason getting upset at the wrong people. Your hatred for blizzard and its employees runs deep for whatever reason so I'm just gonna let you sit in it. 

>wont even look for a job out of sheer convenience or indifference

How about you and I actually do something about this issue rather than comment on the internet? Oh wait, you wont out of sheer convenience or indifference.

Have a nice day friend.
I don't know. How many?
You do realize that not everybody is a volunteer for war right? Many people are forced into war due to their circumstances, and no not everybody has free will to make all the free choices they want. 

I'm also not saying your completely free from moral responsibilities if you go to war. If you commit atrocities, like murder or rape then your guilty of these crimes, but trying to hold men morally responsible who were simply following orders is not accurately allocating the blame on those who actually deserve it. You would put this burden on the one's giving the orders, not the one's receiving them. 

You gave the implication of those who are working under the "Greedy and Manipulative" Gaming industry are some how doing something wrong when it couldn't be further from the truth. 

And I agree with you, most people do value convenience, money, and security higher than integrity or human rights violations on the other side of the world. It's a shame, but a lot of us are ethnocentric and the majority do not have the means to be otherwise.
I think you are just trolling at this point, but that is a very simplified view of how a corporation work. Decision making isn't made by some 20 year old tech support rep, it's made by the management. Calling everyone racist is not really helping your case, and honestly - i don't see the racism in here. No one is hating on Chinese people, they are hating on the Chinese government.
Erm, your whole reply was citing of context, but sure.

I am very happy that you're so privileged that you're able to make a moral statement by quitting your job. I have friends and co-workers that would end up homeless if they made such an action.

But i guess you're right in that fuck all the people trying to provide for their families, they should absolutely put their kids on the street by prioritizing the moral high ground.
I get what your saying, I do agree that continuing to work somewhere that has horrible values, you are contributing. However, I can understand if someone is living paycheck to paycheck, they can't just quit right away.. But it's time for them to find new jobs and get out.
Just curious, do you apply your tegridy standarts to citizenship as well or only to occupation?

As in, if your country commits atrocities and you still live and pay taxes there although you can leave, do you share the responcibility to the same degree as with job?
My family > People a million miles away I don't know and will never know. So yes.
Get another job lined up before you quit. To just quit and not have things like a paycheck and health insurance (one of the reasons having insurance tied to your employer in this country is bullshit) lined up is irresponsible if you have a family. I am not saying they shouldn't quit if they feel the company's principles and their own don't line up, but there are not many safety nets for people living paycheck to paycheck.  What about people that have a dependent with a pre-existing medical condition? Are they supposed to just up and quit without health insurance? It's easy to virtue signal and tell people what to do if you're not the person in the situation.
> Based off of your original comment, you're not very calm. Doesnt seem like anything I say makes sense to you, and all you're doing is for some reason getting upset at the wrong people. Your hatred for blizzard and its employees runs deep for whatever reason so I'm just gonna let you sit in it.

Ah, the good old mind reader argument of *"No, I know better what you actually are!"* - quite impressive.

> Your hatred for blizzard and its employees runs deep for whatever reason so I'm just gonna let you sit in it.

I don't hate their employees, I just think they're hypocrites if they plan to keep working there. 

> How about you and I actually do something about this issue rather than comment on the internet? Oh wait, you wont out of sheer convenience or indifference.

I pass the Chinese embassy daily on my work to work here, and I took part in 2 protests already. 

Your contribution so far? 

Have a nice day as well, and we're not friends.
Then educate yourself and come back later. See you around.
> You do realize that not everybody is a volunteer for war right? Many people are forced into war due to their circumstances, and no not everybody has free will to make all the free choices they want.

Most western countries have moved away from a conscription model, so yes, by the very definition it is completely voluntary to sign up for military and combat.

And I highly doubt that there are scenarios where someone could not find ANY other job than joining the army etc. That's nonsense. 

> but trying to hold men morally responsible who were simply following orders is not accurately allocating the blame on those who actually deserve it

Of course the people calling the shots are also morally responsible, to a much bigger extent even. But if you pull the trigger you're making a conscious decision to take someone's life. Of course we created laws to avoid soldiers being legally accountable for every kill, but morally speaking you are absolutely responsible for pulling that trigger and ending a life.

> You gave the implication of those who are working under the "Greedy and Manipulative" Gaming industry are some how doing something wrong when it couldn't be further from the truth.

I'm not saying anything like that, I'm just saying you can't have your cake and eat it too. If you're working for Blizzard with all the benefits coming with it, you can't just post a picture on Twitter and pretend to stand with Hong Kong. Or at least I won't buy into it because I think it's as hypocritical as it gets.

Side note, here's the official apology from Blizzard to China, as posted on Weibo (basically Chinese Twitter) and translated: https://imgur.com/a/OGyZvO4

If you're not appalled by that as a Blizzard employee, then you've truly lost any integrity.
lol put their kids on the street ...sry, I can't really take you serious anymore with all that hyperbole. 

Have a great first world life.
I’m not priveleged at all, but the fact that you use that term suggests to me that you have never seen a bit of adversity in your life. Which goes a long way to why you think a couple weeks of ramen is worse than directly materially supporting an outright and openly evil regime.
I've actually never said that anyone should quit right away, that would be overly dramatic nonsense. 

But yeah, if you want change, then try to find a new job. Covering a statue won't do much beyond social media points.
> As in, if your country commits atrocities and you still live and pay taxes there although you can leave, do you share the responcibility to the same degree as with job?

No, because a western country is usually a democracy that you can change from within by either becoming active yourself or simply with your vote. 

Companies aren't democratic which is why integrity doesn't leave you with many choices. 

Nice try though, 3/10.
Good to know you have no savings and no skills that you can use to find a new job. Maybe now is a good time for some self reflection?
You actually have no idea what my situation is and are speaking out your ass when you claim I am virtue signalling. I assure you my money is where my mouth is.
>Ah, the good old mind reader argument of "No, I know better what you actually are!" - quite impressive.

Sorry don't understand this, english not good enough but not really sure what your point is here.

>I don't hate their employees, I just think they're hypocrites if they plan to keep working there.

yes of course, it's easy to just switch jobs on a whim. Blizzard is damn good for your resume and I'm sure plenty of talented programmers can easily move along just fine, but what about everyone else in more volatile positions? I don't know, you tell me.

>I pass the Chinese embassy daily on my work to work here, and I took part in 2 protests already.

Good for you, I retract my previous statement. Of course I'm assuming you also don't use apple products, only eat locally grown non-imported produce and work for a studio that has no market in China whatsoever? Surely you aren't a hypocrite either.

>Your contribution so far?

Talking to you apparently

>Have a nice day as well, and we're not friends.

Yes we are.

Anyways, doesn't seem like I'm getting through to you so I guess there's no point in going further with this. I won't bother wasting time reading your responses, I think we're both just better off going about our days. :)
So, you don't know that as well. And, I suppose, you don't know what IPs are. But that doesn't matter, because your initial point was about number of games per years
I mean, honestly - I don't get why it's so fucking hard to understand why everybody at blizzard is not "highly educated skilled people" and why they can't just "quit their jobs". 

You're trying to make me the privileged one, but if you think it's that easy the only one with such values are you.

But i wish you a great life as well!
I grew up with lots of love, but we couldn't afford to two slices of ham on our sandwiches. I know about being poor. What the fuck do you know about me?

Your post history suggests you own pretty recent apple products if you use IOS 13 btw, so i guess you know something about directly supporting china.
Thinking average citizen has more potential influence over the country than an average employer over a company is on negatives out of 10 but ok.
One day I'll take advice from Galaxy Brains on Reddit possibly. But that day is not today.
What money?
> I think we're both just better off going about our days. :)

absolutely. Cheers
> because your initial point was about number of games per years

Yes, at Blizzard. Your whataboutism bores me by the way, have a good one.
> I don't get why it's so fucking hard to understand why everybody at blizzard is not "highly educated skilled people" and why they can't just "quit their jobs".

Everybody can, all of the time. It's a choice, and sometimes an inconvenient one by your own words.

You are valuing jobs in the tech industry higher than human rights, that's the very simple explanation and demonstration of your first world privilege.
> What the fuck do you know about me?

Just that you think it's appropriate for employees of evil to continue doing evil because it brings the paycheck in.

How can you even claim to be against what Blizzard is doing? You realize it's THE SAME FUCKING THING right? You are excusing the employees for doing THE SAME THING but for a much lower price.
>  i guess you know something about directly supporting china.

You're clearly a fucking racist piece of shit. Just get out of my sight.
*employee
Ah yes, having a savings of 6 months worth of bills and teaching yourself a new skill, sounds like terrible advice to me.

Dont crush yourself under that heavy brain buddy.
No. I just said that 1 game in 3 years is pretty average result for gaming industry for a new AAA game. That's not slow at all. Rockstar games was just an example. And you're trying to reduce merit of blizzard development team for no reason.
ah yes, another day, another sub, another one-sided argument by you. i'm almost impressed at this point how you seem to just constantly be in an argumentative state with anyone over anything, each day, with almost every thing you comment on.. idk if that takes skill, or you're just a really terrible person and everyone in your life must just tolerate you whenever you're around.
You are constantly argumenting on the premise that everybody at Blizzard will easily be able to find a new job due to being in the "tech industry" and being "highly educated". That is just factually not true. Blizzard has lots and lots of employees doing "non-skilled" jobs. 

Second of all, you're really clinging to the word "inconvenience". I was not using that word in the context you're implying, i was wording it in a way that i am aware that i am privileged actually being able to survive a few months by having savings. That is not true for most people, especially when working in a field where the pay just covers rent and necessities (which is the case for most tech-support/sales/customer service reps). 

It's not a choice if you have to choose between rent and moral integrity in matters such as this .
> And you're trying to reduce merit of blizzard development team for no reason.

I told you the reason: They're not releasing new games anymore. 

When is the next game scheduled for release? Oh right, they haven't even announced a goddamn thing, so probably another 2-3 years away. At least.
> Blizzard has lots and lots of employees doing "non-skilled" jobs.

And those non skilled jobs also exist in other companies, even in the same industry sector. And then it's still a solid foundation to have worked for an industry leading company. 

> It's not a choice if you have to choose between rent and moral integrity in matters such as this .

Actually it is, it's only difficult if you desperately want to live in California or some other metropolitan area with insane rents. 

So yeah, sunshine state vs. human rights and integrity....tough call indeed.
Boiling down your arguments to "sunshine state vs human rights" is so disingenuous i don't even know where to start. It's much more complicated than that which shouldn't be to difficult to understand. You can't afford to have integrity if you have to choose between life necessities and your job. If you're poor it doesn't matter if you're living in the "sunshine state" or Beijing. You have a solid chance of ending up homeless nonetheless. Furthermore, if you already made a life in a meteropolitan area it's not a matter of just pack up your shit and leave. Try to put yourself in other peoples shoes. It's tough shit for the people of Hong Kong and the citizens of China but in a world where practically everything is contributing to china in one way or another you are not able to make such a choice unless you really have to means to. It's blatantly obvious you're either trolling or to privileged to understand.
> If you're poor it doesn't matter if you're living in the "sunshine state" or Beijing

Nobody working for an industry leading company in California is poor, period.

> but in a world where practically everything is contributing to china in one way or another you are not able to make such a choice unless you really have to means to.

Solid whataboutism mixed with a vague claim, I like it. 

Everybody can get a new job. Maybe not today, not tomorrow, but everybody can work towards that. 

My point is: Most people won't even try because integrity is something that you only display in facebook posts or on Twitter... or Reddit. 

And before you ask, yes, I have walked away from 2 well paid jobs in my life for ethical reasons, and I'm doing absolutely fine.
>Nobody working for an industry leading company in California is poor, period.

This is just not true. You know nothing of customer rep #42:s economic horse powers.

>Everybody can get a new job. Maybe not today, not tomorrow, but everybody can work towards that.

This i agree with, but now you're moving goal posts. 

>And before you ask, yes, I have walked away from 2 well paid jobs in my life for ethical reasons, and I'm doing absolutely fine.

Thats great man, but thats not an option for everybody.

It's just very ignorant to assume that everybody have the means to walk away from a job for ethical reasons. That is just not the case. I mean, if you can, once again - good.

But If you can't, thats fine to as long as you're aware of it and do your best to change your life situation.
> This is just not true. You know nothing of customer rep #42:s economic horse powers.

I do know that Blizzard's customer support is located in Ireland and France, not in California. 

> Thats great man, but thats not an option for everybody.

It is, it's just more difficult, let's say if you have children for example. But you absolutely can write applications and at least give it a shot. But most people won't, and that's my whole point.
I have absolutely no doubt in my mind you would’ve made excuses for nazis in WW2. It’s just clear as day, this is literally the *exact* same situation.

You disgust me.
Jesus christ, i’m not making excuses for Blizzard you dense motherfucker. A goddamn service rep in Paris is not responsible for Winnie the Poo suppressing the people of Hong Kong. If they can switch jobs then thats great but they are slaves under the hamster wheel as much as the rest of us.

Get a reality check, fucking hell.
> A goddamn service rep in Paris is not responsible for Winnie the Poo suppressing the people of Hong Kong.

Yeah, they are. You're living in an alternate fucking universe. If everyone stopped working for Blizzard, THERE WOULD BE NO MORE BLIZZARD.

> they are slaves

Not even remotely close. You obviously have a really poor grasp of history if you think modern employment in a first world country is comparable to slavery. Sit down and shut up.
Yeah, okay dude now i'm sure you're trolling. Your entire post history is "shithead, fuckhead, racist that". If not, you seem like a very ignorant angry man. How am i the racist one if you clearly supports the same regime by using apple products and playing Wow? Erasing your account today doesn't absolve you of liabilty, the Chinese government were doing crimes against humanity a long time ago and suppressing the people of Hong Kong months ago.

And i didn't call them slaves, i called them slaves under the hamster wheel, don't make arguments in bad faith.
> How am i the racist one if you clearly supports the same regime by using apple products and playing Wow?

I'm inclined to think you are the one who is trolling here.

Do you *seriously* have difficulty seeing the difference between the evil, anti-human actions of the Chinese Government and simply being a company that happens to be Chinese? If you can't see that difference, it means you're a racist. An ***extreme*** one.

There is nothing wrong with something just because it was made in China! That is not a thing! Your assumption that it is a thing is what makes you a racist.

> slaves, i called them slaves under the hamster wheel, don't make arguments in bad faith.

You've *got* to be kidding me. Buy a fucking mirror, asshole.
>Do you *seriously* have difficulty seeing the difference between the evil, anti-human actions of the Chinese Government and simply being a company that happens to be Chinese? If you can't see that difference, it means you're a racist. An ***extreme*** one. 

But apple is not a Chinese company. They are an American company who just today got backslash for removing the Taiwanese flag, therefore directly supporing the anti-human actions of the government the exakt same way Blizzard did today.

&#x200B;

And yes, you're the one putting words in my mouth.
No, the words came out of your mouth.

I'm done with this tried conversation. You are an intellectually dishonest racist. Your opinion doesn't matter anyway.

Blocked.
Not even bothering to enforce your assertion? You didn't know that apple wasnt a Chinese company right?

Haha, but yes it's easier to silence opponents then actually replaying to their arguments. Hm, it sounds exactly like something else...
