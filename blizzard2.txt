Wow, Classic.
OMFG this is the best one.
Finally, some good fucking post.
I saw the news earlier today and knew this subreddit would be on fire. I love this and support it.
This should be common
I feel like this would be even better as a 4 mana cast. 

FYI, the Chinese HATE 4. Like as much as people who build tall buildings hate 13.
Guys this was my first post on reddit am I doing it right
Ooof understatement, my lord, the great internet troll lord is PROUD of you SON.

A powerful photo. This snowball will be bigger and bigger for blizzcon.
Honestly could be a neat card idea (and 'thematic' as well). I've seen the version with mass Silence and add 5 coins to your hand. I forgot how much it cost, but it could enable crazy one-turn plays
sounds like someone doesn't want their game banned in china. might cost them a lot of money
The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: 六四事件, liùsì shìjiàn), were student-led demonstrations in Beijing (the capital of the People's Republic of China) for the establishment of basic human and press rights and against the Communist-led Chinese government in mid-1989. More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.

I used to play a lot of hearthstone back in 2016 and dumped a shit ton of money into it. It haven’t been a fan of their other games. I know everyone’s up in arms about the whole blitzchung thing and I’ve seen a ton of pole saying they are uninstalling the game. For those who play blizzard games daily have you seen any kind of significant player count loss?
It failed to upvote 3 times BTW.

Sounds legit badass tbh
what really sucks about all this is that almost non of the Chinese people, the ones that can do something about this will not see any of it.
There really aughta be a timer posted for how long it's been that only stops when blizzard reverses it all, apologizes, AND takes the side of the protesters.
 \#FreeHongKong
Lol. Americans making fun of the Chinese government for being corrupt.
I dunno. Seems like power creep. For 4 mana you get the silence all minions so we have to debate prize money vs draw a card. Obviously prize money is worth 6 mana and a card is worth 1.5 so this should be a 10 mana card.
Make the last sentence „Add one coin for each silenced minion to you hand“ and we have a valid card.
Wait, /r/Blizzard is open? Bold move.
It has to be zero mana, basically effortless

Love it. People are only pointing at Hong Kong and not realizing this is still the same government that has killed literally tens of millions of its own citizens with everything from mass starvation to running them over with tanks. The only thing that changed is the faces in government. Any company that bows to Maoist China supports a complete lack of human rights in a pattern that has existed for decades.

Nicely done\~
as a hongkonger, i'd just like to say a big thank you to all of you, especially the poster.
Shouldve made it a common card.
What a value at only 8 mana. Broken card Blizz plz fix.
 Blizzcon is in 23 days. There is no turning back, the backlash will hit them in the face if they stay silent until then.
Oh geez, it’s epic?! I thought it was a common card...
Storm BlizzCon 2019, They Can’t Stop All Of Us
This should be a common card, not epic.
I have enough karma, I can spare some of it with the downvotes I'll get.

***I 100% agree with HK and am pretty anti-China in general***, but Blizz was well within their bounds to do this. They booted the Hearthstone player because he made political statements during a grandmaster tournament interview. One of the code of conduct TOS that all the grandmasters have to abide by is basically "no political statements during the tourney".

As reddit was quick to remind us when YouTube started deplatforming people, "Companies aren't subject to 1st amendment laws". They don't want their tournament streams to turn into post-match megaphones for whatever cause the player wants to champion. Would you guys care if they banned someone for putting on a MAGA hat and saying "TRUMP 2020!" during a post match interview?

And this drama proves that they were right to have that rule in place, because none of this would be happening if people had adhered to the rules. The player could have said all of those things at pretty much any other place or time and would have no punishments from Blizzard at all, but he chose to deliberately break the terms of the agreement he had with Blizzard. 

I don't know about you, but I don't want my Twitch hearthstone tourneys to turn into post match "Vote Bernie!" "Ban China!!" "Fuck Trump!" "Boycot Nestlé!" or whatever else megaphone. There are plenty of other places that you can champion your cause(s), you don't need to hold private companies hostage so you can use their platform as your platform.

In Hong Kong, gamers are deleting the games and account. not only that, but also asking to take back their personal data for their own safety. this should add more work to their admins. according to EU law, if the data isn't processed within 30 days, Blizzard is liable for a heavy penalty too.

Hey, you mind your own business..... nothing to see here, nothing censored, perfect forum, perfect company...
exactly, mate
You're using Reddit, so it's -1000 for you!
No one is arguing that Blizzard isn't within it's rights to do this. They absolutely are.

However, due to freedom of speech, we have every right to call them out on this. And why shouldn't we if we all support the cause?

> I don't want my Twitch hearthstone tourneys to turn into post match "Vote Bernie!" "Ban China!!" "Fuck Trump!" "Boycot Nestlé!" or whatever else megaphone.

Please don't try to equate this to regular politics. You do realise China is more or less Nazi Germany right now and that HK is fighting for it's rights? Don't make this seem like someone is just throwing out a random political opinion, this is a moral issue that people around the world are standing up for. 

Saying that voicing support for HK is equal to "vote Bernie" is dumb. It's like saying "stop slavery in Africa" is equivalent to "vote ____"
I agree, but that does not make blizzards decision any less scummy or cowardly. All they're doing is watching their own ass and bottom line.

They would have suspend him for a month that would have been enough. Taking the money, firing the caster and stopping the player to play in any tournaments for a year just because the man care about his city and want to talk about it is insane.

I always hate that whole shut up and play hearstone mentality, same shit happen to Lebron James in Nba few years ago ... People in sport or e-sport are human being first and not some entertainement machine; they shall have the right to talk when a topic matter to them.

Just a few thousand ground into meatmush, no big deal. When the Chinese really get going, millions die.
This whole event will be causing board and C-level con calls and meetings all week at Blizzard as they attempt to muddle through the mess they’ve created.
I'm equating it to using the grandmaster tournament platform to megaphone whatever cause you're trying to champion. You either have to try and decide what counts as a "worthy" cause you can allow people to talk about, or you blanket ban it. Blanket ban is the right choice, since it's impossible to come to any sort of concensus that would make any sort of overwhelming majority of people happy.
That's exactly the point for shareholders and employees. It's their business to stay in business, just like every business ever incorporated.
Those are just pictures of dead bodies without context. There is no evidence that these killings were unprovoked. The Chinese government acknowledges that about 300 people died in the RIOTS, including soldiers/police. Notice the picture of the burned, naked corpse of the soldier CRUCIFIED in the streets by the rioters. Notice the picture of the army tank in flames. Try that in America and see how far you get. Sit down, chile.

100 points AND my organs?! 好的！
Ok, message is sarcasm, but is it really so needed to put politics in gaming society? The guy who wanted just to get attention to the political problems in HK by breaking the game society is banned is good, isn't it? I support the protesters, but I fucking hate the politics. Democracy? Is it that funny game you play every four years, being a false dilemma itself, where you in 2016 chose between person, who promised to build a wall across the border and person, who wanted to drone assault Assange? Politic is always equals to a fucking hypocrite and lying human being, who will say what he thinks will be better for him. And you started to put this garbage to gaming society.

P.S. I'm probably wrong. If that, please explain why. I'm from Russia myself, and probably that is the reason, why I lost belief in politics.

For an average internet user in China, this text will trigger the Great Firewall and their connection to the internet will be severed.
0/1 Chinese Prisoner you mean. It's not like they'll have the strength to fight back even if you silence them.
Ok that was good lol
Again, from a business perspective Blizzard is entirely within it's rights and it makes sense from their side of things.

My point was just that it wasn't some random political opinion that's being censored. It's a serious issue and that's why people are criticizing Blizzard on it.
>These are just pictures of dead bodies without context. There is no evidence that these deaths were unprovoked.

Yes, because there are actions that *provoke* running dozens of people over with tanks.   You're not serious. 

>Notice the picture of the army tank in flames. Try that in America and see how far you get. Sit down, chile.

In America we have this thing where we (normally) arrest people who are violent unless they're armed with guns.    When that's not what happens, it makes national news. 

What news did this make in China? Oh.  Right.  [Censored.]  Got it.  

>The Chinese government acknowledges that about 300 people died in the RIOTS, including soldiers/police.

Cables from the State Council place it closer to 10,000 actually.  But of course, if China says it was only 200 and some soldiers on top of that, you should believe them.   After all, it's not like they have ever lied before! ... Oh wait. 

You're unbelievable.

In democracy, politics overflow into popular media when the situation becomes serious. This is why freedom of speech works - the government can't completely tamp down on political activism without also shooting their own economy in the foot.

Believe in your friends, family, and yourself. Never give up! The moment you do, the enemy wins.

Its words and phases that China has censored
**Chinese national anthem intensifies**
Well not this block of text since reddit is blocked in China anyway.
Well, if you cast Submit to Communism, you can buff your prisoners +1/+1 this turn.
And again, it keeps blizzard from having to decide what counts as a "serious issue" when they just blanket ban it. It solves the problem before there's even a problem.

The guy could have said the same thing on Twitter, his own twitch stream while playing hearthstone, on reddit, on Facebook, on hundreds of other platforms and times. It is just one small space on the internet where Blizz wants to keep it "Hearthstone only, please".
I can see you think it's cool to have a villain in your world view. But I'm a "critical thinking" kind of guy. You seem to think that the tanks ran over people for fun. Let's forget the incident where a man stupidly stood in front of moving tanks to make a statement (and climbed on top of the tank and yelled something before being arrested). Bear with me - what if some of the rioters provoked the police and soldiers? You already showed me a picture of a soldier who was grabbed by rioters, burned, murdered, stripped naked and crucified in the streets. What if those that were killed were shot and subsequently run over while the tanks were trying to avoid the Molotov cocktails wielded by the rioters?  

By the way, there is literally no evidence that more than 300 people in total were killed. An anti-China organization called the "Tianamen mothers" stated that, in over 20 years of research, they couldn't identify more than 219 people killed.

You have been had, good sir.
Would forever remind the company of what has been done. I'd say one there and mayboe one somewhere more of significance to the freedom of speech to find a good compromise.
so you're expecting the chinese government to come out and admit they're doing that?

or are you expecting to read uncensored official material from a country with no freedom of press?

because i don't think anything outside the two above could convince you.

either way, it's wishful thinking....
I've seen that waiting times to get a transplant are abnormally short.

Here an article talking about it

>Members said they had heard clear evidence forced organ harvesting had taken place over at least 20 years in a final judgement from the China Tribunal, an independent panel set up to examine the issue.

>"I was a prosecutor for 10 years. The evidence is overwhelming," he said. 

>The seven-member panel found it was "beyond doubt" that forced organ harvesting from prisoners has taken place "on a substantial scale by state-supported or approved organisations and individuals", in an interim judgement released in December.

its not hard to find and both left and right leaning news sources agree
Fuck China then, what dos the rest say?
Name checks out. Fuck outta here troll
You have downs syndrome! There are videos of police acting like protesters on a train just to attack them. There is a video of a group of police stomping a man's head while he lay motionless on the ground.

Get off Reddit and put on a goddamn helmet before you hurt yourself.

Jesus. Fuck.
>I can see you think it's cool to have a villain in your world view. But

More like I refuse to believe you are actually this stupid, and I believe you're a shill or troll whose primary objective is to just shit on the west.  Noone with your command of *any* language thinks China is the least genocidal nation on Earth.

>But I'm a "critical thinking" kind of guy. 

Best laugh I've gotten all week.
Thanks for sharing. The number quoted in the article, 60,000-100,000 transplants a year, sounds about right, considering a population of more than 1.4 billion and assuming 1% death rate a year and 0.1% of that giving consent to transplant. But I’m interested in the tribunal’s filed report and I will look for it to see what is written in it.
No idea. I can't read Mandarin
Pink Floyd lyrics make you a troll? Ooor maybe you're just paranoid and xenophobic.
Where? And are you talking about TS or HK?
It took you 2 days to come up with that?
The problem is China claims only 300,000 people are registered donors.

Do you think a third of the registered donors died last year?
God dammit
Ah yes paranoid an xenopbobic. Anything else doc?
jesus the blatant Ignorance on this guy.
Sorry, I honestly forgot you existed until another user reminded me.
The whole point of that text is to try and trigger government censorship automatically since it's basically composed of banned/blocked words and events.
The butthurt equivalent of a wake-up call?
I find it ironic that to those who can't read simplified, the only uncensored words are the "forbidden" phrases.
and that, ladies and gentlemen, is the current state of china. a joke of a nation.
