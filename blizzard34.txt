I just want to say the atrocities to HK protesters won’t go unvoiced and blizzard trying to hide these atrocities will never be accepted. This is a crime to all of humanity to us as a species. It doesn’t matter the nationality or creed.
While we are at it let’s not forget about Mulan and Disney. They support the HK police.
This has already been pushed by the wayside.  Blizzard released a statement, they aren’t going to do another.  

Personally I’m done with the company, I hope others follow suit but I doubt they will comment further or make any changes to what’s been said/done.  The damage has happened and there isn’t going back, it’s pretty clear where they stand and what they value.  It’s a shame, a company I’ve always respected and grown up with has changed for the worst.
Blizzard needs to go back to the good old days...90's and early 20's
3.6 social Credit. Not great, Not terrible.

"Mei with Hong Kong" by JohArts
No worries! look on the bright side, Social Credit means nothing when you in jail or concentration camp.
Mei is BB_ category...
Gotta get all those posts in before Reddit starts being forced to hand over every scrap of our data to some Chinese 'security expert'
Boycott China any way you can.
Woooh! Let's crash their social point system!
Blizzard must be so proud!
You people are embarrassing.  No wonder why I stopped playing Overwatch.  You seem to create conspiracy theories and continue to make memes regardless of Blizzard disproving your claims entirely.  Others who reply in anger clearly didn't do research at all.

(the Chinese pride tweet was mistranslated and doesn't represent Blizzard, in case you were going to use that)
Blizzcon is gonna be a great show in a few weeks.
This overused Political Trending is getting cringy. Stop pretending to care about HK, you didn't 10 years ago, and you spamming chats and comments about how great of a human being you are toward these people wont change anything. This is the new Israel vs Palestine, and if you don't wanna follow it, you're out of the picture, pretty much.

Now look, i will only agree that to me such ban is against Free Speech. Maybe both sides are silenced in order to avoid controvercy, but in this case either you let people talk about it, or you just don't let people talk about it but don't favor one side over the other.
you're about 4 days late to the party to karma farm.

It's done now, you've missed your chance. good luck next time.
does hong kong have the dirty slave internet? Im guesing not but i honestly dont know
Sometimes that kind of thing gives the best results  


Like Civ's nuke-happy Gandhi happens because of that kind of thing, right?
DW_IM_HERE would be jealous!
Fight against China in general. The moment the world looks away, even for a moment, China’s gonna role over HK with every tank and steam roller they can manage to muster. Even if they somehow get their true independence, China’s gonna do everything in its power to undermine HK it can. So basically what it already does it it’s own people but a little bit worse.
Organ harvesting at -100 points
Yeah it was their relationship with money that has influence
Even r/emojipolice gives you a free pass on that...  Unless they too are into 🇨🇳💰
[removed]
How. What exactly did they do? Enforce rules? People seriously need to stop with the false equivalency thinking that the punishment was because of the content of what the guy said. It's because exactly what blizzard president said but people want to just make blizzard out to be a company that loves China's humanitarian abuses
Help us out, give us the correct translation.
I mean nothing was dis proven and the tweet has been translated by multiple parties to the same effective message but you do you.
r/gatekeeping
Oh you support Hong Kong? Please list the name of every person who lives there or you’re just jumping on a trend dum dum. Fake supporter.
Yeah but one side is an authoritarian dictatorship and the one isn’t, so it’s pretty easy to favour one side over the other.

Also this is in no way similar to the Palestine vs Israel situation, because whilst this is a pretty complex situation. That one is a whole other ballgame of complexity
The top page of this subreddit says otherwise. Nice try.
[deleted]
Yes.

He was at 1 or 0. But becoming a democracy gives -1 to the nuke score. And they had no negative numbers in the coding. So that 1 necomes 255. And the rest is irradiated history.
Money is a hell of a drug.... Eheehee
I gotta say r/emojipolice might just be the worst subreddit ever
Glad to know that the emoji police can overlook this one. For a good cause
Good job
Use different related languages
You don't think it's at all suspicious that Blizzard reacted so quickly and harshly with his punishment then?

Even then, if Blizzard doesn't want political/social issues on their streams or competitions, then they should be consistent with that. Giving a quick and overly harsh ban/prize removal over a Hong Kong support statement should be an equal punishment to voicing LGBT rights and support on their streams, but there are no issues with those social issues being broadcast. All in all, it's the hypocrisy while trying to defend their actions that is so disappointing.

In the Chinese weibo response from someone who translated on Twitter, the post did not specifically state that China was being defended. 

"A better translation would be -pride and dignity of Countries-"

This is reinforced by how "我国 means our country. 国家 means countries."

Source:  https://twitter.com/HrTobi/status/1182948745643606016?s=20

Lastly, the Chinese weibo has no affiliation with Blizzard as a whole.  The official word in response that's being meme'd is the correct answer.  There is no affiliation with China.
Nothing was proven to "disprove" in the first place.  Everyone that's claiming Blizzard is directly influenced by China is a blatant lie.
Most people just jumped on this trend, that's my whole point. There are fine people in this movement, but most of them wouldn't have cared less if we told them about HK 10 years ago. Documents were signed a long time ago and HK has a reputation of protesting a lot, they did so even under British Reign.

Now if you refuse to be part of the HK Train you end up being called a troll or a Chinese Agent..
I compared it to the Palestine/Israeli situation not for the situation itself, but for social reactions that i have found very similar.
Only because it's the latest outrage circle jerk. Look at EA and loot boxes making children addicted to gambling. Boycott Battlefront 2!

Yeah they are still going strong.
In which civ this bug was?
Agreed, more annoying than punpolice even
Well blizzard themselves weren't the ones to react honestly it was netease as they run everything over there for blizzard but since they give them authority to run everything for them it still falls on them. I'm pretty sure that any but decisions like this will now go through blizzard hq from now on. Regardless i don't think the punishment was harsh really it was using their platform for something that have taken no stance on and will never take a public one because businesses shouldn't. They shouldn't be looked at as a moral compass or to what to support. They're there for only money at the end of the day. The people that originally made Warcraft didn't make the game out of the kindness of their hearts. They made it for passion and money.

Now yes the LGBT thing is a bit hypocritical by the difference there is that they took a stance on that due to business trends not to really have a stance at all
Exactly. If they can't defend their basic rights, I shouldn't be able to defend me liking dudes.
that wasnt a blizzard run event thats why
Well i am not going to argue which country is Blizzard China trying to refer to, but i have to say as a native chinese speaker, your translation is wrong.

We have no plurals in Chinese, Normally if we are talking about a single country, we would use the word "国家" or "国".  if we want to say countries. We would use the word "各国",  The Word "各" means All in this case.

When we really want to use the word "国家" to refer Countries, We need to add words before it,  for example  We would say 很多 国家 or  所有 国家. 很多 means A lot. 所有 means ALL.

So Blizzard clearly meant one single 国家 Country ONLY.

> "我国" means our country.

This is incorrect as well, That Twitter dude should really stop pretending he knows chinese.

 The word 我 means "my" or " I ". Its a singular word refers to one person ONLY,  "我国" means my country, and there is difference between saying my and our.

If we want to say Our Country. We would say 我們的国家,  我們 means our here.
It's okay. I'm sure you're social score is secure by now, you can quit trying to pretend it wasn't very obvious.
Listen, this situation has blown up the last couple of months because of the massive demonstrations. That’s when most people became aware of the issue. People are not jumping on this because of blizzard, and I really do believe people would have cared if they’d been made aware of it 10 years ago. Being mad that people are aware now is really stupid, you should be happy the situation is gaining the traction it deserves worldwide. You should be happy more and more people are siding with HK and demanding China be held responsible for all the terrible things they’ve done both to their own people and to other groups of people within their country.
all youve been doing for the past month is repeating the same shit.

We get it, you're a paid chinese agent, shut up.
You mean the game that they completely changed because of the outrage and that's actually really good now?
feature\*
The very first one.

Since then they've always given him something to reference that as a feature.
You're right when you say that Blizzard will be keeping a much closer eye on these things, they should have recognized anything affiliated with Blizzard still impacts them. 

The recent alteration in the punishment is reasonable and much more so considering the original. A 12 month ban and $3,000 in prize money stripped away because of a vague, catch-all rule is extremely harsh especially if you compare it to a punishment like the one Dallas Fuel's XQC received (4 game ban and $2,000 fine for making a single "homophobic" remark). Of course, you can argue that XQC's blunder was on a private stream, opposed to the primary Hearthstone stream, but both would still affect Blizzard and the actions taken are quite disproportionate to each other.

I agree that a company should not be scorned for wanting to do business with China. They need to make money and people who are angry at them just for making a market in China are as foolish as those who complain about cosmetic lootboxes being a cashgrab. Regardless, I disagree and feel that companies should still be held at a moral standard. For instance, it would similarly be foolish to say that it's alright for major corporations to not be conscious of negatively impacting the environment because altenate methods are cheaper and their primary goal is to save money anyway. Above all, companies (and people) should stand for what is right instead of what jingles, and there is nothing wrong with holding them to that standard especially when the opportunity presents itself (such as with this situation).

Finally (sorry this post got a bit long), the LGBT factor brings up an interesting issue, doesn't it? Since a majority of the western audience shares that same belief, you're saying Blizzard made a business decision to promote it. Though you would think Hong Kong's independence is also a popular, shared Western viewpoint, so why would they not choose to support that if their decision was not somehow affected by the China (which they explicitly opposed in their statement). It's that hypocrisy and sneaky behavior that I, and probably many others, want addressed. Blizzard should be more transparent, more consistent, and be held at a moral standpoint, whether they conduct business with China or not.
Oh, huh...

Yeah sure enough, I could have sworn I saw it was Blizz official, but it's an outside company that partners with them. That's a stickier situation then, good to know.

Thank you.
Even if that's true, the weibo account is not associated with the main branch of Blizzard.  Their opinions do not reflect the company as a whole.  The issue is that by saying this, people won't want to listen because it is their only leverage in the argument.
I don't care about my social score. I speak my mind instead of following the rest of the horde.
Of course they are. But that isn't the first time HK is protesting, they have been doing that even during British Colonization.

I am not saying they are jumping in this train because of Blizzard, but many, many people seem to jump because it is a popular thing to do. I am not "mad", but i sure think many people are hypocrites and don't actually care. You don't hear them talking about the dozens of other terrible situations in this world either.. Then again i respect other people's opinion, but i can feel many folks are following this trending because... it is the big current thing and everybody's following it.
Yeah i'm definetly paid for holding criticism. No. For the past month i've been in university. You repeat the same shit in that movement and that's fine, i express skepticism and i'm a ChINEsE aGEnT. lmao.
And the company that continues raking in profits that weren't even impacted in the slightest
no problem, if people are going to raise pitchforks lets at least do this with the correct info lol thats all im doing mostly lol
I don't get your point, if that is the official Weibo account of Blizzard in China, how can you say the opinions do not reflect their company? How can you say Blizzard China is not associated with the main branch of Blizzard? You are talking like Blizzard China and Blizzard Entertainment are two independent companies.

If that's true, don't you think that's pretty easy to solve this PR mess, Blizzard should just make another statement to declare that they have nothing to deal with Blizzard China, might as well sue Blizzard China or whoever in charge of that Weibo account for damaging their reputation?
So what you’re saying is that a company changing course and making a more satisfying product doesn’t matter because it doesn’t afffect their profit margins?

Because if that’s the case, all you’re saying to me is that loot boxes are pointless and have no place in video games
The Weibo account is run by Netease which likely knows that Blizzard can’t really do anything to fight at the moment. So technically the guy is right in the fact that it doesn’t really represent Blizzard. It wears its name but overall it is run by Netease which opens a whole new can of worms. Anyways hope ya all are having a good day :)
No, I'm just saying that all of this "effort" against Blizzard is hilarious, and I'd be willing to bet that in a month or two, they'll barely have noticed it.

Granted my point hasn't been made in the best way, but that's ok.

Also, I'm not sure what more people want after the latest press release, anyway.
>The Weibo account is run by Netease which likely knows that Blizzard can’t really do anything to fight at the moment.

I think you actually gave the point, this is exactly why people are so angry. 

The point is not who runs that account. Doesn't matter that Netease or whoever runs that Weibo account, The thing dose matter is they knew exactly that Blizzard could do nothing to fight against them at this moment, because the potential risk of losing the whole China's Market, because they knew Blizzard would value Money more than ideologies, which is rightfully so as a company, just too ugly to be openly displayed.
They can say they disagree.
Fair enough point and to be honest that makes more sense :)
And you know this how? Do you work for the company? Btw this is an honest question as if I am given actual proof showing the opposite of my statements I will fully back off and change my statements to reflect my mistakes :)
I have not seen any proof or reason why Blizzard couldn't say "Netease made a statement, we however disagree with it because etcetc". That is if they don't actually agree with that statement of course.

I detest the "Blizzard may want to disagree, but they can't say it" narrative. Although it has a certain irony considering how the chinese feel about free speech.
