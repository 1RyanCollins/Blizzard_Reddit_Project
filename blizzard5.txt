Employees covered that this morning in protest from what I saw on Twitter earlier.

The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, commonly known in mainland China as the June Fourth Incident (Chinese: 六四事件, liùsì shìjiàn), were student-led demonstrations in Beijing (the capital of the People's Republic of China) for the establishment of basic human and press rights and against the Communist-led Chinese government in mid-1989. More broadly, it refers to the popular national movement inspired by the Beijing protests during that period, sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement (Chinese: 八九民运, bājiǔ mínyùn). The protests were forcibly suppressed after Chinese Premier Li Pengdeclared martial law. In what became known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre, troops with assault rifles and tanks fired at the demonstrators trying to block the military's advance towards Tiananmen Square. The number of civilian deaths was internally estimated by the Chinese government to be near or above 10,000.

5 of the 8 core values permanently broken. No wonder Blizzard dosent feel the same anymore
Some animals are more equal than others. Blizzard made clear that Chinese government animals are more equal than Hong Kong protestors
Oh the ironing.

But only if you have money.  
If you're poor, shut the fuck up.
Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age.

光復香港 時代革命.
I don't come here, I don't play WoW, I played Overwatch for a few months but went back to TF2 fairly quickly.  Blizzard has always meant simple but well produced and fun games to me.  

I love seeing you guys stick it to them.  I'm hoping you are doing it on their forums too.  Keep it up, meme the way to a better future.

Hey Blizzard, take a jackhammer to this. And while you're at it move your headquarters to Beijing.

They should change the quote to "Every Penny Counts" Seems more fitting to their ethics, no?
For the (Chinese) horde?

Every voice matters? I always thought it said every dollar matters.
Alright I found a link of blizzard [“apologizing”](https://www.reddit.com/r/YouFellForItFool/comments/cjlngm/you_fell_for_it_fool/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) for what they did

Unless you are chinese
Gaming isn’t what it used to be. This is what happened when games became billion dollar enterprises; Utter ruthlessness, in the endless pursuit of profits. Squeezing every single cent, at the expense of morals and good ethics.
Oh no, take it down! This is a very provocative message!
Unless its pissing off China..then you get gagged by Kotick.

Except for the voices of those in Hong Kong, of course.
Aparantly not
The funny thing is the Orc statue was made in China.

First Thing’s First: Modeling
A team in New Zealand scanned the original 12-inch tall statuette and created a virtual 3D model

Up Next: Details, Details, Details
The 3D model was then sent to a manufacturing center in China, where the artists sculpted, molded, cast, waxed, bronzed, welded, and buffed to turn the virtual presentation into a 12 foot tall statue.

Last, but Not Least: Delivery
The massive sculpture was transported from China to Irvine using a custom-built steel dolly and shipping container, and set into place with a crane.

Wait, Blizzard's symbol for freedom of speech and equality is an Orc Warrior whose Horde time and time again have been the primary oppressors and aggressors in their own setting against a defensive alliance? Seriously?

This was before blizzard wants china's big Dollar in them.
What ever happened?
I find HILARIOUS that everyone is now acting all shocked at blizzard, pointing out that kind of shit, while ignoring the fact that they have been working overtime to ban and mute people not being ultra PC in their games.

I guess the freedom of speech only matter when you agree with what's being said, amirit?

...for the horde.
Paper ain’t gonna cut it, someone go shit on it or pour cement on it
Someone needs to get a big truck, put a hook around that statue and Saddam topple it down
Not even the same placard though? Even the backgrounds are different colors.
Disclaimer, I by no means support Blizzard's response. The way they responded to a rule infraction was terrible and underscores how the company is continuing to change for the worse.

With regards to the plaque however, if trying to be objective, you can rationalize the phrase "every voice matters"  is centered on developing a video game. Meaning, anyone at Blizzard is welcome to provide input, regardless of his or her role in the company.

Regardless of the above logic, I still can't support Blizzard. Valuing money over wanting to help the greater good is not for me.
Wait so even Blizz employees are pissed?
Fuel to the fire, classic blizzard.
I’m glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family’s organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting).

Could we all agree to say fuck CCP instead of fuck China? I agree with sentiment, and fuck Xi for sure, I just think saying China sends the wrong message. Fuck the oppressive government, not neccesarilly the people or the culture.

Haha I will post this every anti China thread. Even though I asked the question after the AMA ended.
The US govt has no business telling private corporations how to run their business when they're not breaking any state or federal laws.

The corporations need to be kept in check by the consumers. Don't like their business model? Stop supporting them. Vote with your wallet.

The US govt can support Hong Kong by putting economic sanctions on China, but the last time that was done, /r/politics and other leftist subs freaked out about how bad that'd be for our economy. Well, we can't have the cake and eat it too. 

The same goes for gamers and private corporations. Don't want Blizzard to take these shitty stances? Stop buying their shit!
Trump reportedly promised to Xi Jinping that he would remain quiet about the Hong Kong protests in return for a more favourable trade deal.
I laughed.Then felt bad for laughing.
I'm unironically glad that he got banned because it kickstarted a huge blowback and made who knows how many more thousand people aware of what is happening in Hong Kong. It was a heroic act!

Nah. Most Chinese immigrants immigrate because they don't want that sort of life and government. Most overseas ethnic chinese (or at least i can say for the younger generation ones) dont identify with the country's politics and policy these days either. Dont mix the government with the people. The loudest voice in China are supportive if their government because ... U either keep silent or u will be silenced.

i was going to start playing overwatch.. thank god i didn't buy the game yet. Fuk blizzard
If only this actually worked. Companies like Blizzard are so damn massive that it's nearly impossible to screw something up bad enough to cause the neccessary levels of participation for wallet voting to have an effect.
Yeah the only problem is China has A LOT more wallets.
Captialism: Endgame.  
Luckily there are many small gaming companies that make great games, even bigger ones like R\*. The passion for "clean" gaming hasn't died, it's just the big companies that got off "the human track" in their search for endless expansion...
Fuckin good on them if true
EVERY VOICE MATTERS. (unless it affects my pocketbook)
I agree. I am angry at and afraid of the chinese influence on this world, but it astounds me how many people are suprised. China literally has a billion more people than the US, of course a company in its search for endless expansion will look there. It also isn't something new that certain global players don't want any kind of political messages in their official media publishings, especially not if it is that controversial. As if blizzard has ever really cared for human rights? Why do people expect the epiphany of capitalistic companies to care about this kind of morals and ethics? Yeah "every voice matters" coming from a bloodthirsty autocrat ( also looking at you, Sylvanas). The horde keeps slaves and tortures their enemies. Oh the irony...

Blizzard is doing a good job of it themselves.
No need to give blizzard a reason to look anything but morally reprehensible which is how they look currently.
If you look around the base of the statue about a foot out or so it has 1 of the 8 "core values" etched into the cement it looks like.  Assuming that's what the top picture is.
Someone in the company is at least.
Former employees now probably.

At least they can't be extradited to China.
Fuck yeah they are. Most of my friends who've left the company did so because of how shitty the job has become due to new "chinese market focused" oversight. My bud who worked their for 5 years put in more overtime work than anyone on his WoW team, didn't see his family for like...3 months at the beginning of last year due to pre expansion work. He couldn't get a promotion even though he's well overdue. Moved to Hearthstone team, supposed to have a much clearer path, hardest worker and they wanted to promote him. Activision only allowed for 2 promotions within that branch this year, instead of the 5 Blizzard used to use. He left for Epic and is now out of state.

Very few employees feel like Blizzard has been living up to their values in the past few years, and the lines are split among those who are being paid serious bucks and those who are still scraping out a living.
Yes.
I’d imagine plenty are pissed, there’s tons of people that work at Blizzard Irvine it’s essentially a campus.
Why would you assume every Blizzard employee shares the same values and has the same reactions? Of course some of them are pissed, I'd assume a large majority are outraged and resentful of Blizzard for this move. This was a decision made in a boardroom, not by a company-wide vote.
Certainly, you've gotta keep in mind most of them are us, it's the higher-ups that pull bullshit like this.
Someone needs to saw that orcs head off, or harvest it’s kidneys.
Of course employees are pissed when their corporate overlords publicly break with the company's values for a quick buck.
Blizz employees are treated like garbage so they've probably been pissed for a while. Some live in their cars in the parking lot since the wages are barely enough to cover the cost of life around their headquarters. Contract terminations without warnings, poor work conditions in general... (Chinese?) stockholders have taken over Blizzard and made it a milk farm.
My brother's friend works at blizzard. He said basically everyone he knows there is not happy about it.
This is how google backed out of China. Internal pressure. Not external.
The only people you should be upset with in Blizzard are the head honchos. The normal devs aren't calling the shots in any way, shape, or form.
Of course they are. You really think that Blizzard employees support this shit? Most of them are just as pissed as we are.
Just because you work for a company doesnt mean you immediately agree with everything said Company does.
Of course. This decision wasn't made democratically, from the lower-level animators/developers.
Blizz employees are shit on nowadays just like the customers.
Why wouldnt they be? This is a "reasonable human" sort of thing
Why wouldn’t they be? Not everyone working for a company supports said companies ideology especially when its not known beforehand.
If we had classic blizzard we wouldn't be having these problems, post Activision it's been a god damned shit show.
Dumb comrade you copied the whole thing!  
  
-50 social points.   
Privilege to use bus and train for your family has been removed.    

( afaik this shit is real... you cant use public transit if your score is low )
I'm pretty sure those were separate plaques, you can see the "voice" one was embedded in the ground, not up like the one below the statue. The voice one is on the ground on the ring around the statue.

It's about the message dipshit
Shut the fuck up, idiot.
lol they downvote and dont get sarcasme gg hahah
More than you've done.
Xinnie the Wu
No man, fuck *CHINA*, I know that as a westerner it's hard to believe, but the majority of their nation is just as primitive as the government - and they're OK with it.

Just go watch any of the "gwailo" Chinese youtubers who archived their journeys and experiences (prime being laowhy/Winston) for over a decade, it really is illuminating and explains so much as to why they act so primitive and disgusting.

The government is only a symptom.
I'm going to kneel for Hong Kong
I agree wholeheartedly, people need to understand that the CCP and China in regards to her people and culture are different. Saying "fuck China" only hurts any progression to removing the CCP's control, Chinese citizens will see "fuck China" and see it as an attack on theirselves. We need the people of China to win this fight, we need them for the hopeful revolt to come in the future against the CCP. Yes there will be bigots who follow and support the CCP's rule, but understand that many Chinese citizens are being oppressed, their knowledge and critical abilities are hindered by just being born and brought up in China.

&#x200B;

Understand the true fight, don't let the CCP blindside who the real problem is like what they're doing in Hong Kong by trying to pit the Hong Kong demonstrators vs the HK Police, Government and Chinese people rather than the CCP itself.
Chinese people aren't stupid, they get the idea. If someone says "Fuck the US" I don't treat it as a personal attack.
Yeah, I 100% agree
Should be "Think GLobally' minus china.
you mean, Activison-Blizzard 

There is no just blizzard, they are one now.
that explain why they become so greedy.
Dollars aren't cool anymore, it's all about the yuan now.
Fuck trade with China. Any trade with China is a bad deal and we've had about 2 decades to see what happens when you give the totalitarian fascist regime of China access to Western markets.
If he hadn’t been banned, I doubt his statement would’ve rallied many more people to the cause. But silencing him? That’s a hell of a shit storm, and goddamn did they get more people onto the independence train
Why would you use your freedom of speech if later your government got you arrested?
If the consequences of free speech is getting arrested for protesting the government it's not free speech. The HK protests started peacefully. The police state that China is implementing escalated the situation. This is 8946 all over again.
[Yup](https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/21349313/the-orc-statue), with [eight core values](https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/company/about/mission.html?blzcmp=blizzard-news)
Exactly.
Yes, like that. I wonder how widespread the account removals will really be.
Ohhhhh! Thanks man!
I messaged my friend who works there today. He’s more angry than I am. He says unless “they rectify their embarrassment of a business plan” he’s going to resign.

He works in OW QC, so it’s not just hearthstone feeling heat internally. He said he’d tell me how others are in a bit.

**EDIT UPDATE BECAUSE YOU ALL WANTED IT:**

My friend talked to his manager about it and got told “it’s a developing situation not too relevant to Overwatch, so we don’t know anything more than you” (they segregate the shit out of their different teams based on tours I took). His two good friends are just as pissed off. Not nearly as exciting as it all sounds, but that’s usually reality; a boring dystopia.
Don't jinx them.
They can be sent on a business trip to China.

Then fired.
CS employees are protesting in Irvine.

 On another point, people sending death threats to CS employees are fucking  knee jerk assholes who don't understand the person making barely above minimum wage answering tickets has no say in what happens in tournaments
You have been banned from r/Beijing
Lol blizzard would probably swing that if China gave them even a shy smile.
You didnt read the fine print in the hiring package did you?
worth it
Former employees with an awesome potential for lawsuit $$. Heh.
Yet.
So from one chinese overlord to another or am i misunderstanding who Epic is?
>Activision only allowed for 2 promotions within that branch this year

As a business owner, this is bizarrely triggering. As if a promotion is purely an incentive to be sprinkled delicately, and not a better utilization of a person that may require more facilitation from the business. If you can spend more to optimize the effectiveness of someone in a better position with a positive cost/benefit, you do it. Limiting your business in that capacity for any reason other than budget would be absurd.

I'm also implying that they have the resource to absorb investment cost in themselves, but i wager that's a safe call, even though I'd be talking out of my ass to assume that.
Also, I just got word that Blizzard is planning on setting up extended barriers for protesters at the convention center for Blizzcon. They are expecting protests, they don't plan on doing anything to curb the issues, it seems.
>left for Epic  

Talk about moving sideways.
It's showing in their games, WoW is fucking trash. Relaunching the work of their predecessors is pretty telling.
Welcome to every other job.
I do think we're not talking about Activision's part in this enough, there was a reason Bungie was popping Champagne the day they got out from under Activision. A lot of the most nickel-and-dimeing practices come from them, and I wouldn't be shocked if these policies came from Activsion, not Blizzard.
Well, at least there's that
Blizzard is actually the world's largest jury and decisions are only made once unanimous.
^“Backed ^out”
"backed out"
Backed out? They're working on a fucking China-safe search engine.
Yea - Blizzard pre-Activision was awesome. Ever since the merger / sell-out things have gone down-hill :(
Yup. They do.

Thank you !
You dont say!  I'm merely reflecting on how cheaply they covered it up.
I was going for some good old fashioned British humor.  But what I got was an epic gamer moment...  I'm gonna use the N word!
Your right, I've done almost nothing to protect the blatant hypocrisy of a million dollar corporation....  the fuck you talking about?
No, most of them ain’t going to go against CCP.

I understand what you mean but it seems that you have no idea of how fucking corrupted Chinese people are. 

Just want to say, patriotism ain’t a bad thing, but look at Chinese people and their “patriotism” bullshit in recents incidents, like the NBA one. You’ll understand why they are unredeemable.
Yeah but it seems it's because of Activision that blizzard does this shit since it started when they merged so I blame mostly Activision
Blizzard apologists will eventually say that this was Blizzard's master plan.
Did they get arrested?

Feels to me like they made a statement and suffered the consequences. Just like when people have made dumb statements against LGBT here in the West, they say it, then suffer the consequences. 

That's how it works.
 The commentators and HS player weren't arrested. 

They just faced the consequences for their statement, same as if you got on TV and started railing against LGBT.
Those went out the window faster than googles "don't be evil".
Jeez.
If my conversation with the call-center woman was any indication, they got a lot of those requests today.
Definitely want to hear about this.

It’s about to become an OW issue if the internet gets their way with making Mei a symbol of resistance.
Saved for later, please report back :)
>Please, keep us posted - I'm also very curious about the situation inside Blizzard.
I've followed Overwatch pretty hardcore for the last 3 years.

Jeff and his team probably are furious. Overwatch is just a game, but there's no doubt that they believe the stuff they're putting out. Freedom for all and such.
Can’t wait for a follow up!
Also shamelessly saved for later. Thanks for the info, say hi to the friend.
Leaving my tactical dot for a follow-up!

.
Thanks for the update :)
Just to be clear if blizzard lose the chinese market your friend and a lot more people in that building will lose their jobs, WoW have 70% subscription based on the chinese servers, just to nane one game, so the blizzard employee have the right to quit their jobs because they the CeO and excutive people did what they did otherwise they wouldn't have a choise to leave their jobs.
Funnily enough it’s about to get just a little more relevant to Overwatch.
Keep us updated please
Well since that Mei character is involved now. Overwatch is becoming of relevance. The sheer number of upvotes on that part is prett impressive.
Tell your friend to stop watching fake news and do some research on what’s really happening in hk before ruining his career.
>they segregate

Very progressive. Really taking notes from China. Next they'll be sending muslim employees to conversion camps and telling them to give up their religion or be imprisoned/worked to death
Ayyy lmao
don't Xi'nx them
Fired for no-showing after you disappeared.
with their passports taken away? D:
I mean, he's didn't leave for morally based reasons, they're just the company that provided him the promotion and almost doubled his salary. People who work at these companies know that what the company is doing is shitty, but they still have to put food on the table. They're not rich, most entry Blizz positions get paid ~60k, which for Ca is not enough to live on.

It's dumb to think that these people aren't just more disenfranchised workers doing what they can with the careers they've been forging.
[deleted]
Epic is 51% owned by their American CEO. They are not publicly traded.
They absolutely thrive on "blizzard incentives" at the moment. Hiring people who are passionate about their games isn't just a method to keep their games churning out good content, it's also a way of making sure they want to stay for the yearly Blizzard bucks or "fun atmosphere" around campus. 

I can't personally speak to the specifics of the interior decision making behind this, but I do know that before he stepped down, Morhaim was actively trying to buy back Blizzard from Activision in attempt to return to their own interests. He was not able to do that, obviously, and that was a huge factor for his resignation.
[removed]
Lmao God that's going to be such a shit show.
In regards to?
I mean, as much as I think it's ridiculous, people have been clamoring for WoW classic for almost a decade. It just became a priority recently because Blizzard shut down the unofficial servers.
That's why I play FFXIV these days. It's leagues ahead of WoW and only getting stronger.
Dammit you beat me by about 15s posting the exact same thing
And your point is still retarded...
I agree that many are in a state of pro CCP, however a lot of people are in the 'neutral' or "I don't really care right now" stance alongside those who are against the CCP but do so quietly. So unless you can back up your claim that most of them won't go against the CCP then I'm afraid I have to disagree with you.

Well I myself am Chinese or more specifically a Hong Konger in this context by heritage. Grew up within the culture, visit China and Hong Kong annually for leisure and work. So I'd like to think that I have some experience about China and it's culture, values etc. More so than the average person, what I'm seeing from your comment is a lot of generalising though. You can't just make a claim that all Chinese people are corrupt. You only think that because that's probably all you hear about the Chinese. But I've spoken, studied and worked with plenty of reputable and rational Chinese people. These will be the same people who with join and lead the movement from within China.

However this is also why I am pessimistic about the outcome of Hong Kong right now. The CCP can't let Hong Kong win this battle. If they do then others in China may feel empowered and see it as a real chance for them to do the same. Once that happens, the CCP is over. That's why in my opinion the CCP will do whatever it takes to crush this movement in Hong Kong even if it leads to more escalation and bloodshed. It's evident that the global parties of the world aren't going to do anything. No country is willing to sacrifice their economic relationship with China because all in all, it's about economics and money. Hong Kong is waiting to be swallowed up, it's not a case of will it, but when.

TL;DR don't generalise, these are the exact reasons I stated in my previous comment that will only further the gap and relations with the people we need on our side.
I blame the money more and the fact the old staff is gone.
They chose to merge because of the money. Dont pretend like blizzard was manipulated into becoming this. And anyone who didn't approve would easily find jobs elsewhere as blizzard was a juggernaut in the industry.
Sweet summer child. You really think Blizzard would have acted any different on its own, when millions of dollars are on the line? 

Don’t give them convenient excuses. They would have done exactly the same.
Yeah it works in the west, not in the authoritarian government that china is.
And by stealing his prize money, and firing the commentators for just happening to be on stream. Blizzard sent a message that they stand with a dictatorship that is commiting a genocide. Over the ideals of the country they were founded in. Which is the issue.
**Electronic Arts has entered the chat.**
The different game teams are quite different in terms of culture - is not be surprised if the OW team had the most anger right now, based on the people I know (though that’s obviously anecdotal)
Seeing as their core beliefs were “we aren’t here to create money. We’re here to create gaming experiences and to bring joy to this world” according to my friends, I think they’d rather leave.
We have a group of friends in HK - I e said it before.

We are well aware of what is happening.
Dude they split up teams for secrecy and leak recognition reasons. - they’re doing enough dodge shit without that. Think about it - why should a hearthstone junior game tester have access to the wow content that is sensitive content?
Ayyy lm kidneys off
Fired and then charged the family for the bullet fee.
They’re not doing anything shitty. And you’re right I was merely checking if i understood right.
Isn't Blizzard in Austin? Just curious. 60k still isn't a lot, but its a lot more in TX, than in CA (Lived in texas for 15 years, have lived in CA before that, and for the past 3.)
You’re going to have to specify which one and source that for me please cause I legit don’t know what you’re talking about

Aw man. Thats so sad, the man really was one of us.
I'd suggest that's pretty similar. Except you moved yourself to a new situation, and it was acknowledged.
Ya at Dell it's basically tech 1, tech 2, engineer 1, engineer 2, senior engineer, principal engineer, distinguished principal engineer etc but other than your roll naturally evolving and more responsibilities being tacked on you may well be at the same desk with the same manager
Smart money says invest in popcorn :)
Tencent has a major interest in Epic and they’ve been floundering as a company with anti-consumer practices in the last couple of years.
Live sucks, there's a reason people weren't happy with it.
*mission failed we’ll get them next time*
You really dont find any irony in them covering this up with some loose leaf paper and scotch tape?  I must be retarded because I find it absolutely ridiculous
It's money.

There's plenty of amazing staff at Blizzard. OVerwatch's team is amazing.
 Deflection. 

You said they were arrested, they weren't. State your case, or admit you're wrong.
Did you watch the stream? The commentators all but supported him, they knew exactly what he was going to say and let him. 

Exactly the same as if a western player had given a controversial statement and commentators had supported it.
>is not be surprised if the OW team had the most anger right now

i think you're agreeing with me. YOur sentence is just a bit awkward.

But yeah, i think Hearthstone would obviously have strong feelings. But overwatch has a very inclusive message. This goes very much against their themes.
~~Dicks~~ *kidneys* out for ~~Harambe~~ *China*
This is actually a thing in China

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullet_fee
Ah, misunderstood. Although, I really wouldn't be surprised to see them make similar concessions to China for the market they have out there. This is a much bigger issue than just Activision-Blizzard. All game companies in this country are getting in while the getting's good. If there's any kind of real coordinated effort to give Blizzard the middle finger here that gains traction, we will see them pay lip service and do damage control, but no one's passing laws to prevent this market from becoming the goal for these companies.
HQ is in Irvine, CA.
They have a campus there, I'm pretty sure it's just a call center... don't quote me on that. I can only speak to the HQ in Irvine.
Riot = League of Legends.

Epic = Fortnite

So, yes i think you're misunderstanding who Epic is.
I mean, he was a businessman, but his intentions were a hell of a lot more pure than J Allen Brack and crew now. I hate watching people shit on Morhaim and praise Hazzikostas. That man single handedly ruined BfA.
They're 40% shareholders IIRC. Major, but not controlling.
The story telling sucks for live. The gameplay of classic sucks. Both suck to a degree. Both have their positives. Both are grindy as fuck, though.
Too bad I can't just pull a Google and shadowban your comment to take all the credit
Good introspection!
>I must be retarded
hmm the chinese extradition law is kinda an arrest so i'm not wrong
I watched the clip, and to me they looked surprised. I don't think they knew.

&#x200B;

Do you have an example of this Western player getting banned for a controversial statement? Cause I'm failing to think of any.
I am indeed haha!
Wow.  That's balls-deep totalitarianism.
I don’t mind developer etc working for the companies. Business developers and marketing people that push for such decisions are vultures on the other hand. And that’s coming from a guy who has sold weapons and armored vehicles to countries
I am going to go deeper than you here. Riot is 100% owned by Tencent nowadays. 

Epic is 40-48% owned by Tencent nowadays. 

Im gonna go ahead and say that 40-48%, while not being a deciding share, is, arguably big enough that they are the same thing, especially when the 51% left belong to a single individual who can be coerced by force, threats and or money, which China has an abundance of all three.
He was, but he had a ton of genuine passion and love for the franchises and worlds under his wing. He treated us like customers, not dirt.

Ion is... fine. But nothing much more.
I got hyper
Classic gameplay is way better than live! Classes have more than 2 core moves :D
Now that would not be very cash money of you
wut.

Wrong country, and ridiculous logic.
I guess you didn't watch it...

They literally say "Alright, go on and say it (those words)" as he puts on his mask and they duck down.
> I am going to go deeper than you here. Riot is 100% owned by Tencent nowadays.


right, but you're the one that brought up Riot. 

>Epic is 40-48% owned by Tencent nowadays.

40%. Tencent bought 48% of *some amount* which equated to 40%. 

>Im gonna go ahead and say that 40-48%, while not being a deciding share, is, arguably big enough that they are the same thing

No, it's absolutely not when the other shareholder has 51%. Epic is not publicly traded. There's far less ways for Tencent to influence Epic. Epic is currently 100% controlled by Tim Sweeney. Your statement would be fair if no other stakeholder had over 50%. But that doesn't apply here. 

> coerced by force, threats and or money, which China has an abundance of all three.

If Tim Sweeney dies, it's not like his stocks go up for sale. And it'd be a huge story if Tencent were involved in the murder of Sweeney. The kind of shit that would have Tencent thrown out of the country. Money? Epic has plenty. And there are thousands of investors that'd line up to buy part of that fortnite and EGS bounty. 

Tencent absolutely have influence at the company. But they don't have absolute influence and Sweeney came out big with his statement. No way he'd back down.
Ion is just the lead for WoW, not CEO. And he's not fine, trust me. Every WoW team member prior to launch of BfA was trying to get this dude to be smarter on the systems they were creating for the xpac, he refused and didn't listen (hence why I said employees are pissed that they're not living up to "Every voice matters".) He is purely focused on Raid content even though their metrics show that raiders make up a significantly small portion of the game, and he let things like warfronts go by the wayside in terms of development all the way up to launch. He's not one of the good ones, dudes.
Ah, like rogues! That have sinister strike (or backstab if you're a dagger rogue) and eviscerate. Or mages! Who have either frostbolt or firebolt. Or Paladins that have... auto-attack.
The Googleyness would be off the charts tho
Sure, let's say they did know, I'll concede the point, because I think it's irrelevant. It's still a nuclear response to an issue where one side is clearly in the wrong. 

I notice you have not decided to give me an example of a western player getting banned for saying something controversial about western society. I take that to mean you do not have one. Your government (excuse the assumption, but I have serious doubts that anyone other than a citizen with 3 generations of indoctrination would stand up for such a dangerous dictatorship.) Routinely censors their own country, and now they are trying to impose those censor laws on the rest of the world. Going to jail and getting killed for speaking out against your government is, in the most basic sense, really fucking awful.

Free speech should be an unalienable right, and sure, there's consequences. Stupid is, as stupid does. But speaking out against corruption, should not warrant this kind of response.
I am sorry friend but the key I see from our discussion is the integrity of Tim Sweeney. 
Everything we mention here leads to the point that Wether he is influenced and obeys to China’s order depends on his integrity. 

Personally I do not give him the benefit of the doubt when it comes to that, but you are free to do so. 

It was an interesting discussion nonetheless and I thank you for it :)

Also FYI: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/dfh4lk/discussion_this_subreddit_put_out_several_warning/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
I know, I just said as much since you referenced him.

Like I said, I think he's fine. Not great for the game, kind of a twat, but at the end of the day that only brings me smoldering resentment. Im heavily invested in retail, or I at least used to be.
This is so triggering because I am at the verge of being a good WoW player (curved this season, got my fair share of rio score too) and the mixture of timegating and boredom is graspable in between; if you wanna focus on a raid that’s cool but then you only hand out loot once a week and titanforging is random? How am I supposed to enjoy the raid content somehow more than before if a) I can’t work towards a TF, it literally just happens whenever the game feels like it and b) I can’t run multiple groups or on more days because I only get loot once a week, so tomorrow it’s gonna be 8/8 and pray for loot, and then I am off to playing my alts and doing some azerite stuff again until an m+ group comes together because there is literally nothing more left to do.

It just goes to show how little that man understands about this game and what actual raid prep, world activities and other factors that just impacted your performance as a team member brought to the game and how they made me value raids much more in the past, specifically because it didn’t happen within the raid itself. A raid just has to mean something within the world it is set in and not just as this separate entity where the actual action is.
I find that very hard to believe when no one is more frustrated with the game than high end raiders.
Theres a lot more than Ion at fault.  Everyone has their flaws, but it has to be heavily driven from further afield. Ion was once the GM of a very famous, pioneering raid guild in wows earlier days.
Fire ball! + All the side-spells unpruned, and stuff like trash buff stacking a thing. PvP way more skillful and burstier :D
Guys its ok we took out the do no evil part from our rules now we can do anything hahahahaha^hahaha *ha ha ha*
>Sure, let's say they did know

They did, it's perfectly clear if you actually watch the clip and speak the language. 

>I notice you have not decided to give me an example of a western player getting banned for saying something controversial about western society.

Svenskeran from LoL is a famous example from a few years back. 

But lemme give you a hypothetical: Say an Overwatch League player in an interview said he hated that Soldier 76 had been revealed as gay, and thought that was disgusting, or any other similar sentiment. 

How do you think that'd be received?

Would you be threatening to cancel your account in response to his punishment?

Or would you be commenting "Freedom of speech is not freedom from consequences!"?

Funny how this only works one way, huh?

>Your government (excuse the assumption, but I have serious doubts that anyone other than a citizen with 3 generations of indoctrination would stand up for such a dangerous dictatorship.) 

Pathetic. 

I'm in favor of the HK movement. That doesn't mean I can't call out your blatant hypocrisy. 

>Going to jail and getting killed for speaking out against your government is, in the most basic sense, really fucking awful.

How's Manning doing lately? What about Snowden? Oh hey, what about the guy who founded Reddit? Hmm.

>Free speech should be an unalienable right, and sure, there's consequences. Stupid is, as stupid does. But speaking out against corruption, should not warrant this kind of response.

Weasel words. You admit I'm right with one breath, then try excuse it with the next.
I mean from what I've heard he's a nice dude. Eccentric but nice. Living near RAleigh he's just about the only legit famous/powerful person i've got near connections to (people that know him). Obviously meeting a guy at a party or knowing his wife isn't exactly representative of him. 

But in his support he is the only major game/esports head that has come out  in support of free speech when it comes to his fortnite game. 

Also, unrelated to videogames he bought a huge amount of lands for preservation. And donated millions to conservation in my and state area.

Also, until Fortnite, Epic/unreal games has been a huge positive to the gaming industry and widely considered one of the most ethical.
Gotcha, thought you were comparing them as a similar position. I certainly don't think he's fine, either way. Bad ideas and bad efforts at coordination with his team.
https://www.reddit.com/r/KotakuInAction/comments/dfh4lk/discussion_this_subreddit_put_out_several_warning/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

He does sound like a cool guy but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t have only HIS best interest at hand.
That adds nothing though. 

Having a large % of a publicly traded company is a big deal. Having a large % of a private company means nothing.

Also, just becuase Tencent has 2 board seats means nothing. 2 out of 5 = 40%. Obviously Epic listens to Tencent. You always listen to your investors. But that doesn't mean Tencent have control. Sure in some company the board of directors are all powerful. but sometimes they just aren't.
Actually I was more referencing the point that are made under, regarding the documents stating the power of veto or requiring the presence of a specific member of the board before doing something.
