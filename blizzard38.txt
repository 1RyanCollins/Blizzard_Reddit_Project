Blizzard gives a free 1-time nickname change, why not use it today?
#If you or anyone your know plans on deleting their account, don't just delete your account! You can request your Data from Blizzard and if they dont follow trhough within 30 days they have to pay hefty fines inside the EU. If everyone does this, they might have such an enormous backlog and will have to pay up.

Join games and apread awareness and say that mei is infact a symbol for freedom
I changed my name to the same
Can we some how add jim reynor from starcraft stand side by side with Mei?
So [I tried this](https://i.imgur.com/jfS2Ata.png) while waiting for account deletion options to come back online and this is what happened. According to Blizz's [battletag naming policy](https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/26963) this doesn't violate any rules. Does this mean they've changed their [Code of Conduct](https://battle.net/support/article/42673)?
Same I‚Äôm FreeHongKong#2324
Looks like your sub is still active.
I cancelled my CoD and W3: reforged pre-orders. Playing HS under this nick now, not intending to spend another dime in any blizzard game.
I was going to do this but then noticed a Btag change costs almost as much as a month of WoW lol (which I'd just cancelled my sub for).

Just Changed it as well
This is a great alternative for those who don't want to cancel their subscriptions at this time.

Just stop playing instead
I need to wait 180 days to use it again

You harm the wrong ppl with it

Thank you, your decision is not useless, it will help build momentum and presence for the dissatisfaction we all feel, against Blizzard, against corporate greed in general, and against the big scary that is China. As unlikely as it is, I hope it will result in something big. Even the biggest tsunami have to start as a ripple after all. Undeniably, the most effective action is still to just stop purchasing and subscribing to their products, but I understand that it is a difficult choice to make. I disagree with people who would call you a hypocrite for not doing more, but all the same, I would like to leave my warm encouragements.

Not sure how much of a shit that fucking company still gives about StarCraft. Make it Diablo instead.
Oh shit, here we go again

Only if you‚Äôve used your free one in the past. If not, you can do it for free.
No, it's really not. It's as effective as posting a meme to Reddit to feel good about yourself and do nothing else, which is to say it's completely ineffective.

Unless you were being sarcastic, in which case I'd suggest adding a /s üòâ
just for the stonks tho.
can you stop promoting that shit?
Nice, trying to use a controversy to promote in your own favor. Dunno what gods unchained is but after looking through your comments, damn I‚Äôm never gonna play it. I hope you‚Äôre a bot, and it‚Äôs not an actual persons job to copy and paste that shit constantly
It's the simpliest way to notify friends. You can do both.
Why not both? Before you stop playing change your name so your friends might stumble upon it in their friends list.
Nah ima play. I need escapism and other games ain't fun for me
Lolwut

As I posted above. I don't want people to feel bad for taking another route.
R u telling me. How to protest?

Like  China? ü§î
Sorry I don't know well enough Diablo lore and character. But yeah. Bring characters from every game they made and make a team for that. Hell we can make a team  of hkfreedom fighter in hots as well.
how are they funding it by playing a game they already paid for? would that technically cost blizzard money to run servers that no one is paying back on?
Well, it helps spread awareness. Some people here certainly care about the issue but simply wont want to stop playing their favorite games or they aren't educated enough to understand why they should. For those people who want to help support the cause but aren't willing to take drastic measures, spreading awareness is an amazing thing to do.  


I'm glad to see we've got intellectuals like you helping out though. /s  üòâ
Thought I recognized your handle; o7 cdr, and I agree.  "Raising awareness" is more often the last step on a path to nowhere, not a first step on a path to real effects.
Cancelling your Battle.net account doesn't really accomplish anything.  Your WoW sub?  Yeah, cancel that.

You've already given Blizzard your money.  Just don't give them any *more*.  You don't have to deprive yourself of products that you have already paid for.  

In fact, a more effective measure would be to use your account *more*.  Tack on bandwidth and storage costs that Blizzard must pay for.

I dont blame you. Parting ways with something that makes you happy because the company has made realpy shitty decisions can be tough and you being happy is still important too. 

That being said, fuck china.
What other games have you tried?
That's actually kind of sad to read, since nothing Blizzard makes nowadays is a paragon of its respective genre. Even Diablo and WoW have been laid low by competitors.
Then you are a part of the damn problem.
Don't even need to play it. Just doing the name change and never logging in again will keep FreeHongKong sitting in people's friends lists until Blizzard goes full CCP.
‚Äúaren‚Äôt willing to take DRASTIC measures‚Äù 

I understand your point, but I can not accept that quitting a video game can be considered a drastic measure for an adult. That is ... just absurd to my ear. People are fucking dying out here.

Don‚Äôt change your name. Quit the game.
Ah, I understand now. You are happy to make a statement of support or damnation regarding some injustice, but not willing to actually do anything about it that will have some tangible effect, or sacrifice anything (especially something as drastic as withholding your time and money from a video game publisher).

/s

You know what raising awareness does if it's not followed by some tangible action? Jackshit, besides making you feel better.

If you don't care, or don't care enough, to be bothered to do something meaningful, that's fine, but then keep your mouth shut.

If you claim to care about something, and you can do something about it that isn't particularly difficult or costly, and you choose not to, then you're a hypocrite and should definitely keep your mouth shut.

"Raising awareness" by changing your name/handle/nick/whatever to something about supporting HK on blizzard games and platforms while playing said games is like decrying a political figure in a whisper while wearing a "Vote for this political figure" hat, t-shirt, pants, socks, shoes, and tighty whities you bought at a vote event for said political figure.

It's not possible you are unable to see the hypocrisy thereof.

I have never advocated for account cancellation friend. I advocate for denied purchases and denied time on their games.

Denied purchases for obvious reasons.
Denied time because it's the second most important metric to a video game publisher and developer for video games that are online multiplayer in nature, right after revenue generation.
Yeah, I don't play Overwatch so I haven't come across this character, but she looks too damn cute and innocent for my jaded tastes, and the memes are incredibly cringe worthy.

It may not be much at the end of the day, but blizzard ain't getting another cent or any more support out of me.

I've disapproved of the whole HK thing since that extradition legislation was announced, and felt very strongly of the events that followed, but I've never really had an opportunity to make manifest my personal values with regards to the whole tragedy.

But I can do something now. It's small, and it won't have much of an effect, if any, on the situation itself, but it's something I can actually do.

Very few politicians or companies are prepared to truly annoy or challenge China because of their current or future dependency on Chinese money, labour, or products. They essentially have a pass to do whatever the hell they want without much more than lukewarm statements of mild disapproval. It's maddening.

There is a certain politician who has had either the courage, insanity, or idiocy to put forth an actual challenge and resistance to China. He may not be my favourite politician (I have none, they're all self serving dicks parading as champions of the people) but that refusal to bow to Chinese demands and put up some form of a fight (figuratively speaking) is the first real resistance I've seen in a relatively long time.

They get away with a lot of shit that wouldn't be tolerated in the west, and I won't let this blizzard thing slide when there's something I can do.
There's no popularity nor money being funneled via a name change. Change the name. Notify the people on your friend's lists.

Don't play their games. Don't log on anymore. Uninstall. A ghost account with "3 weeks offline" and a "#FreeHongKong" name is a lot more alarming than a deletion of an account to friends.

I don't mean to antagonize, but I just think it's also a viable option, with the other being complete discontinued support (deleting account).
You didn't read his last bit, "You can do both." You can still not play their game and get the free name change via their website (don't even have to login to their games) and show your solidarity.
I can't stop playing. I know I've tried. But I also know I can stop giving them any more money while I play it.
[deleted]
FFXIV, MTG, tf2 basically all the games that blizzard has made better in my opinion. I just cant stop playing
Idk what you're on but WoW is huge
Wow is the biggest mmo? What? Its like one of the only mmo left
Ok, I dont really care
I only read the first paragraph because I've already begun doing my part via a boycott. I don't play WoW so I don't have a subscription to cancel, I can only speak with my absence & name change as a former Hearthstone player. I've started playing Gods Unchained, the TCG that offered Blitzchung an opportunity to join their tournament and pay him his lost Blizzard winnings regardless of whether he won their tournament or not.

However there are people (who are not me) who care about the political situation but simply wont stop playing the games they enjoy. Whether or not that is morally correct is irrelevant, we both know these people exist. People who are simply upvoting hate threads and doing nothing more because they want people who will actually take action to see it. By spreading awareness via a simple name change they can at least offer something, regardless of how minuscule an impact it may be. If they inform even one additional person about what is happening via the name change (a person that may otherwise be completely unaware) then it's beneficial because perhaps that additional person will actually act on it.

They become the billboards and posters on the sides of public transport if I were to draw a comparison to the advertising business. Sure maybe the people who are posting the signs might not make a difference, but the people who see the advertisements might. & That is better than nothing.
Use the stones to destroy the stones.
So its confirmed it will make me feel better though?
Realistically, cancelling your subscription has as little of an impact as changing your name. It would only matter if a vast number of people do it, and if a vast number of people change their names I think that would also likely have an impact on Blizzard's relationship with China.
How else am I going to reach the Overwatch players who don't read news other than through the game? Plus, it doesn't exactly cost me shit, and the game is still pretty fun to dick around in.
[deleted]
If the money has already been spent on buying the game then me playing or not changes nothing. However if I refuse to spend further money then I am still enjoying my product while no longer giving the company my money. 

I see it as the same thing as when all those people were burning their Nikes when Kaepernick was kneeling during the NFL games during the national anthem. Im not gonna burn my Nikes over it but I wont buy your products again if this is how you view our values.
Lmao put the phone down kid. You arent accomplishing anything at all
My comment was in regards to quality. Large consumer base doesn't mean quality. I don't want to resort to a food analogy, but are you really gonna say that like, McDonald's is huge so that means its burgers are the best in the biz?

Considering how many wow players have been flooding into the communities of XIV, GW2, and ESO, the game's definitely not the titan it once was for myriad reasons. Classic pretty much breathed new life into it, which goes to show that a fifteen year old version of the game with all the rough, jagged, unpolished edges is somehow more desirable than the slopheap they're serving up now. Conveniently tied to a retail subscription, at that.

It's okay to like junk food, but modern Blizzard is far from the developer they used to be, and each game they have out now, someone else does a lot better. If you're not there for the cheap instant gratification style that permeates a lot of their modern titles, at least.
FFXIV? ESO? GW2? Sure they don't have as many players as WOW, and definitely not now that Classic has finally released, but I'll take a game with a smaller playerbase over this current form of Blizzard, willing to quietly submit to the Chinese government to keep the yuan flowing in
I'll give you that it's better than absolutely nothing, without issue. 

My problem is this: for people with the mental capacity to understand the vagaries of the situation (ie not children or mentally impaired people), to elect to do nothing but declare their dissent and then do nothing tangible is disingenuous and hypocritical, because all they need to do is stop paying for and playing a set of video games. They don't need to go to war, or attend a protest, or do anything other than stop playing a specific set of video games.

There has never been an easier way to make a statement of this nature.
Pretty sure it will, and you needn't give anything up for it either! ü§∏
Agreed, a few people cancelling their sub wouldn't have any noticeable impact. Ten thousand cancellations however would send a very strong message. The more cancellations and denied purchases, the stronger the message. 

Can you imagine the message if a million subs were cancelled, alongside denied hearthstone pack purchases, cancelled BlizzCon tickets etc?

Name changes may have an impact on blizzard's relationship with a Chinese consumer base, maybe. That is beyond your control. What is not beyond your control is withholding your money, and that has a very definite and known result. 

I've been playing blizzard games since I was a damn child. I really like my blizzard games. If they had taken a measured response to this whole thing, I'd feel differently. If they had issued a warning and a message about staying apolitical, I'd feel differently. I'm not unreasonable.

They decided to take a heavy handed approach, without temperance and without consideration of circumstance, merit, or reasoning, using rules as an absolute justification for what is patently a severe course of action based on political considerations (which would have financial ramifications). Exactly as a certain single party country, ruled by a man who recently had the constitution changed so he could rule indefinitely, might have done.

I won't stand for that by financially supporting (and now that I'm aware, also implicitly condoning) Blizzard's attitude or stated position. It's a personal decision, and I don't expect anybody else to do the same, but I'd sure as hell like it.
You sound like a jerk. "Protest my way or you are just virtue signaling!"

 What are you doing to make a difference? Hashtags?
Investors are interested in concurrent users and engagement metrics. Good statistics makes them more likely to invest money in Blizzard.

I mean if we go off census and armory numbers from before Classic came along to artificially inflate retail's floundering numbers, XIV was pretty much close to WoW when ShB was a month or so away.

There's a reason they don't disclose sub numbers, and it's not because "OH WE DECIDED SUB COUNT DOESN'T MATTER!"
You're right for the majority of situations, but there is a group of people who have emotional and/or mental dependencies on blizzard games, whether it's WoW, Overwatch, SC, whatever. 

I make no claims about this group of people other than they exist, and that for some, giving up their singular mental escape would be a significant hardship to them. Giving up a particular game, or ANY hobby/activity, is not equally easy for every person. 

For those who have a very difficult time or would suffer some kind of mental hardship by removing the game from their life, I'd argue that a name change might be all they CAN do, and is not *necessarily* disingenuous. 

(I've been reading your other posts in this thread and surrounding threads, and I understand and wholeheartedly agree with where you're coming from. I only disagree with the assumption that quitting a specific video game is just as easy for everyone as it is for the majority.)
Those are not your ordinary hashtags. Those are **bold font hashtags.** That will show them!
Ya this guy doesnt understand you can take 5 mins to change your name in support and then log off and not log back on again, hes acting like changing your name somehow supports blizzard lol
Fair enough. I've known some people who are as you describe, and in most of those cases, of the people I've known personally and in-game, they have bigger personal fish to fry than worry about ideological battles.

The truth is, however, that you're talking about a minority. The majority of players, who I'm certain have their own demons to battle (as we all do), do not have a dependence on blizzard games to keep them going. It's to the majority I speak.

I would just like folk to have the courage of their convictions. If they disagree with what's happened, and are able to (as most are I'm relatively certain), I'd implore them to do something more efficacious than some token action, as it's within their power to do so and would cost them very little. That kind of opportunity doesn't come around very often.
Glad you pointed that out, I thought he was just virtue signaling.
I will repost several times in the same thread so people see my **bold fonts multiple times!**
Yea its a good alternative now that blizzard prevents us from deleting our accounts.
Well said.
